RADIO INTERVIEW, LAFM

ROB FAIRS:  It’s wonderful to welcome the Prime Minister Scott Morrison live in the studio. Welcome to the programme how are you doing?

PRIME MINISTER: I’m doing great Fairsy and thanks for having us in here today. It’s great to be back in Launie.

FAIRS: It’s nice to see you down here. Let me ask you off the top, hey, you’ve really got in and met some of the locals, including I believe one of my favourite places, Sporties last night? Is that true?

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah, we were at Sporties last night with Johnsy who cleaned me up on the pool table, he’s a bit of a local legend there as I understand. It was great to spend some time there last night, just chatting with people with Bridget Archer, our Liberal candidate here in Bass. But I also got down to do my laps yesterday at the Launceston Aquatic Centre and so a big cheer to all the kids out there at the South Esk Swimming Club, the national swimming club of the year back in 2015, they proudly proclaimed. So it was nice to meet all of them, you guys keep swimming. A lot of local champions down there at that pool.

FAIRS: Ariarne Titmus of course, a Tasmanian local really kicking serious backside nationally and internationally too now, which is wonderful. Alright Prime Minister, there’s a lot to get through and I know your time is tight and I really appreciate you popping in.

But let’s start off with Bass, starting off with Bass because obviously to retain power this is one of the seats that you’re going to have to win. A recent poll showed it was neck-and-neck, so that gives you a lot of heart. Announcement-wise with the election, May 18 is being thrown around. Now that’s going to put me out because that’s when my charity fundraiser is. So thank you with that today, but is that the date that you’ve decided on?

PRIME MINISTER: People won’t have to wait too long to find out. But obviously, there were three dates, the 11th, 18th and 25th  and those options are now narrowing, so I don’t think people will have to wait too much longer. Yeah, the election will be in May and we’ll call that in the not too distant future.

But here in Bass, I mean, the number one stand-out reason for supporting us here is Bridget Archer. She is a first-class candidate, she has been great over there as a local Mayor and I think that she’s really going to bring a lot to the job. She’s got a great heart and passion, she’s a mum raising a lot of kids. She’s really juggling and doing it all and I’m just thrilled to have her in my team. But we’re backing her up with great policies. The thing I love about coming down to Launceston more recently, particularly over the last few years, has been just how positive people are. I mean the northern Tasmanian economy has really, really turned around.

FAIRS: Yes.

PRIME MINISTER: And you can just feel it. I mean just talking to people at Sporties last night, talking to local tradies, talking to people in the building and civil construction industry. I met a couple last night that has moved down from Melbourne, they’re working down here and I’m sure they’ll start a family here. These are the choices people are making about northern Tasmania and what is making it happen is the strength of the economy and the great partnership I think, that we’ve formed here with Will Hodgman. The State Government, the Commonwealth Government, working together to get people into trades, to get the projects moving. We’ve got to keep this going and I just found the optimism here the last few years, coming down here, intoxicating. It’s tremendous.

FAIRS: I totally agree with you Prime Minister on that for sure. There are a lot of concerns as we know, health being one of them. Now you’re announcing or going to announce today I believe, a $92 million package?

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah that’s right. It’s going to focus on elective surgery, it’s going to focus on mental health care, maternity services, breast cancer diagnoses. These are the priority issues and its’s a range of initiatives. A new birthing suite here at the Launceston Hospital, further across the north we’ve got a new linear accelerator machine at Burnie, that’s so breast cancer patients will save $1,500 on MRIs and PET scans that are now covered by Medicare. We’ve got $4.5 million going into cancer infrastructure. We’ve got an additional 6,000 surgeries and endoscopies that are going to be provided under a $20 million services and infrastructure plan. There’s going to be here a new adult mental health centre here in Launceston and mental health is a huge priority for me. Many people will know in the Budget - and if you didn’t then this will be good news for you - $461 million is being invested in tackling youth suicide and the youth mental health challenge in this country. It’s the biggest package of measures a Government has ever handed down to really take on these issues.

Greg Hunt is here with me today in Launceston and he’s really been championing that cause. More Headspace centres around the country, we made announcements last year for more Headspace centres and we do know that turns things around for young people. So we’re going to keep investing in the mental health of our nation, starting with our youngest, but all the way through. As I said, a mental health centre here and we’re also going to have one treating eating disorders, which is another priority. I mean, I’m a parent and what parent with kids going into teenage years - or even sadly sooner now - isn’t that just your worst nightmare? So together, we can confront all that.

But you can’t do it unless you’ve got a strong economy and that’s what is so exciting about northern Tasmania. It’s economy is going forward and we’ve got to keep that going.

FAIRS: Prime Minister, one thing, looking at this in a nutshell; aged care. We’re an ageing population, it’s a sector that I believe from personal experience is drastically underfunded. There is so much that needs to be done there and well, what about that? I mean, are there plans in place for that or are we focusing on that?

PRIME MINISTER:  The Government has been putting a $1 billion extra into aged care every single year, $1 billion extra. We do have an ageing population and a priority for us particularly over the last 18 months has been has been in-home care places.

Now we’ve put in another 40,000, including the most recent announcement in the Budget, for in-home care places. What that does is two things; the first thing it does is preserve the choices of Australians as they age. They can stay at home. That’s where so many of them want to choose to be so you can be there for the grandkids birthdays, you know, people can still come round, you can stay in touch with your friends, be in your community. This is what people want and we’re doing that with the in-home care places. We’ll continue to invest $1 billion every year.

Of course there’s the Aged Care Royal Commission that I announced last year and that is to confront the challenges that we do have in the aged care system and we need to build that culture of respect for older Australians, not just in our aged care system but more broadly.

FAIRS:  Prime Minister, cost of living. In a recent poll, it’s come out on top as the key election issue. It’s a massive problem and down here a lot of Tasmanians are struggling, battling to make ends meet and it’s getting worse and worse. I notice, one of your ideas and plans was a feasibility study in the Basslink Connector for example, with the Battery of Nation type scenario. So with investment like that, is this something where that sort of thing can turn around and become cheaper and stuff? But that’s a long way off, what about Tasmanians that are battling today?

PRIME MINISTER: Tax cuts, that’s what. We’ve already legislated our first tranche last year and we’ve taken more tax cuts for this year. I mean NATSEM the independent economic modeller has already said that someone on average full time wage will be $1,000 better off under our plan, than under Labor’s plan.

We believe that people should keep more of what they earn. Labor believes they should increase taxes by $200bn over the next 10 years.

Then there’s their emissions reduction policies that they can’t even explain, about how much that will increase costs. If Bill Shorten can’t tell you what his vehicle emissions standards - his car tax - is going to cost you, for the car that he’s going to make you buy, then don’t vote for him. If he can’t explain it, if he doesn’t understand it, how does he expect you to understand it? And he wants you to vote for him.

On cost of living issues, because of Labor’s reckless emissions targets - I mean, we’ve got our target, it’s 26 per cent and we’ll meet it just like we met our Kyoto 2020, we take this issue seriously. But Bill’s policy, he can’t even explain what it’s going to cost you. I mean in that policy, businesses are going to have to spend $35 billion to $36 billion buying international carbon credits from goodness know where overseas. It’s just $36 billion going out the door and for what? That’s $36 billion that could be invested in higher wages, investing in companies, growing their markets, putting new investment into their businesses. He’s just going to put this enormous slug on our economy and it’ll slow it down. The northern Tasmanian economy is getting ahead, forestry industries, tourism industries, we passionately support these and you’ve mentioned the Marinus Link. I mean this is a big project for Tasmania’s future; $56 million to get the planning phase of that underway and done, so we can get in and invest in having that Link put in.

Yesterday we announced $17 million for a skills package for Tasmania, specifically to ensure that Tasmania is battery-ready, with the skills they will need to deliver on that project. So we announced that yesterday and I think that it’s great to get those Tasmanians with the skills they’ll need to ensure that we can deliver on that massive Battery of the Nation project that Will Hodgman and I are just so excited about.

FAIRS:  Prime Minister, I did ask my listeners to submit questions.

PRIME MINISTER: Sure

FAIRS: Just to put to you to get a response from you and I know that time is flying, so I’ll keep it as short as possible. One of them is talking about the NDIS. Now this listener applied for it in January, was told it could be accessed by February, yet still no response, still waiting to hear back. She’s provided all the necessary paperwork and documents and can’t access the help she needs. She’s very, very ill and that’s just one. The NDIS is very a big issue.

PRIME MINISTER: The NDIS is a massive social programme, it’s the biggest change since Medicare. We’ve got 10,000 people, 10,000 people working either within the NDIA or ancillary services working to solve all of those problems. We’ve got over 70,000 people accessing services that never did before and so this is just a very big project. Yes, we agree, it’s a very hard programme to implement and we’re going to keep on making it better year on year on year on year. But I make you this absolute commitment - and it’s not just a commitment, it’s in the Budget and it’s fully funded; the NDIS will get every cent that it needs. It’s a completely demand-driven program and we’ll see that demand increase. It already has been at record levels and it’ll continue to grow.

Just last week I announced the Royal Commission into disabilities, to address very similar issues that we’ve seen in the Aged Care sector. People with disabilities experienced some horrendous things and we’re going to shine a light on that. I think that will also improve the culture of respect, whether it’s in the workplace, whether it’s in healthcare, whether it’s in any part of our society. For people living with disabilities, we’ve got to make their life easier and we recognise the contribution they want to make and we’re going to facilitate that. We’re 100 per cent committed to it, it’s a very difficult programme and we’re getting on with it and we’ve got a lot pf people working on it.

FAIRS:  Prime Minister bulk-billing, that’s another one. There’s basically no bulk-billing doctors here in Launceston and in fact probably across northern Tasmania. Hardly any, which is a real issue because a lot of people cannot afford to pay to see the doctor.

PRIME MINISTER: Well we have record bulk-billing rates right across the country.

FAIRS: Not here

PRIME MINISTER: Well, it’s bulk-billing right across the country and including right across northern Tasmania that we’re achieving these rates, that’s the information that I have. We’re achieving those bulk billing records.

Medicare has never been stronger under our Government. We have increased funding to Medicare by 27 per cent and the Medicare Guarantee fund continues to put in tens of billion in every year. So we’re delivering on that and we’ll continue to deliver on it.

FAIRS:  So there’s no issue with bulk-billing in your opinion?

PRIME MINISTER:  What I’m saying is we’ll continue to ensure that we deliver on this. It’s always going to be a challenge around the country, but what I’m saying is, at the last election, Bill Shorten said that we were going to sell Medicare. I mean it was an outrageous lie. This is what you’ll hear from Labor at this election; you’ll hear lies and higher taxes. That’s what Labor is offering at this election. Lies about what the Government is doing, not telling you the truth about the higher cost-of-living that you will face under their higher taxes and their reckless emission targets. Which means that you will pay for more for everything, whether it’s your car, whether it’s your electricity bill, whether it’s your private health insurance. Whatever you have to pay for, it’ll cost more under Labor.

FAIRS: Prime Minister very quickly, this is another question. Daniel thanks for this one; “When the Libs took power 6 years ago they were claiming a budget crisis when the debt was around $250 billion. Now the debts is more than double in your time, but it’s not a crisis, when you’ve promised that you would not increase it?”

PRIME MINISTER: Well, when you’re in deficit your debt goes up and it has taken us the last 6 years to get the Budget out of deficit and get it back into surplus. I mean that was the legacy the Labor Party they left us.

When we came into Government debt was growing at 30 per cent every year. That’s stopped now. What we’re seeing now is, over the next four years, we will reduce the net debt of the country by $50 billion or just shy of that. That’s what happens, you get the Budget back in the black, which we’re now in. And it’s a reminder; last time the government of the nation went to the Labor Party back in 2007, we went from a $20 billion surplus to a $27 billion deficit in the space of one year. We have been paying that back ever since. It has taken us more than a decade to get the budget back into surplus. It just goes to show; you vote Labor once, you pay for it for a decade. That’s what it means when it comes to the economic management of the Labor Party and I think Australians understand that.

They have had too many goes at managing the nation’s finances and they’ve stuffed it up too many times I think, for people to give them any credit that they know how to manage money. And if you can’t manage money, you can’t pay for Medicare, you can’t pay for hospitals. You can make all the promises you like, but when you look in the wallet, it’s empty.

And you know what Labor does when their wallet is empty? They go and look in yours. That’s why they increase taxes on all Australians.

FAIRS: Prime Minister in saying that, in the polls it shows  if an election was held now you’d be wiped out. The only shining light is your popularity, obviously  over Bill Shorten as preferred Prime Minister. What, this is your opportunity to very quickly  say why you deserve, because you’ve had the revolving door of Prime Ministers, you’ve had total disasters, you’ve had in-fighting, you’ve acted like infants,  school kids a lot of the time with all this battle and stuff. So why should people give you another chance and vote you back into power?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I think it’s pretty clear since we’ve come to Government, we’ve got the Budget  back into surplus. We’ve reduced unemployment to levels we’ve not seen in a decade. We’ve created jobs particularly for young people and our economy is moving forward. As I said, here in northern Tasmania it really is a strong economy, it’s central to everything. The IMF today is talking about a such more difficult global environment. Now is not the time to hand the economic wheel over someone in Bill Shorten, who doesn’t know how to drive an economy. That is what will put your future at risk. That is what will determine your ability to deal  with cost of living pressures, a Government that knows how to run the economy, knows how to manage finances, versus and Opposition that every  time they’ve been in government, they’ve  always stuffed it up, when it comes to programs and the  Budget. You can’t get the healthcare you need, if you don’t have a government that knows how to manage money. Now, we’ve demonstrated that and the record speaks for that.

I think Australians are focused on the future and they’re focused on who is best able to deliver that strong economy and strong Budget that can invest and guarantee the funding for the essentials services they rely on. That’s the Liberal and National parties, that’s who it is.  Our record is there and they know they can trust it, they’ve seen it here with Will at a state level and they’ve seen it with us at a Commonwealth level. If you want to keep that going here in northern Tasmania, well the way to do that is to keep the ScoMo and Will show going.

FAIRS: Alright well Prime Minister Scott Morrison thank you so much for your time, really appreciate you dropping in.

LUCY WICKS, FEDERAL MEMBER FOR ROBERTSON: Well what a fantastic sight to see behind us so many young apprentices. So many young people, having the opportunity to work right where they live, to be able to pursue the dream that they have, to pursue a trade of their choice. That’s what we want to be able to see more of here on the Central Coast; strong family businesses like this one at the Central Coast Motor Group, an outstanding local family business that has been here on the Central Coast since 1986. They have employed thousands of people in their time and at the moment, there’s around 250 people who work at the Central Coast Motor Group.

Our dream, our Liberal and National Government’s dream is to see strong local economies like the Central Coast region become stronger and grow, to see more people being able to work where they live. We do have a challenge on the Central Coast, because too many people have to leave early in the morning and return late at night to their families, because job opportunities are more available in Sydney and Newcastle. Our dream is to see more local businesses be able to grow, thrive, prosper and succeed and employ even more local people here on the Central Coast.

It’s for that reason that I’m so delighted to be joined by my outstanding friend and colleague, the Liberal Candidate for Dobell Jilly Pillon, who is herself a small business owner here on the Central Coast, a born and bred local. She’s a great fighter for our region, she knows the importance of local jobs here on the Central Coast. She knows the importance of providing more opportunities for our young people here on the Central Coast and it’s wonderful to be joined by Jilly Pillon as the Liberal candidate for Dobell, to welcome of course the Minister for Small and Family Business Michaelia Cash and of course our outstanding Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison, who of course is a wonderful friend to the Central Coast and no stranger here. He’s been up a number of times, he’s a great supporter and somebody who always listens to the concerns, the hopes and the aspirations of people here on the Central Coast. I was delighted to be able to announce some commuter car parking for our hardworking commuters, backed by Scott Morrison. It was one of the first issues that I raised when he became Prime Minister and now we have the $35 million investment in commuter car parking, 600 new car spots for Gosford and 140 new car spots for Woy Woy. This is all part of our plan to see better infrastructure and to see more local opportunities for people here on the Central Coast.

PRIME MINISTER:  Thank you very much Lucy, it’s great to be here with you Jilly, it’s great to have you on the team and of course Michaelia Cash, who is everywhere around the country, backing and supporting small and family businesses. It’s great when you see small and family businesses become larger businesses, like the business we’re in here today. To see the apprentices that are being employed and the opportunities people are getting here.

Last week when we handed down the Budget we handed down the first surplus that we’ve seen in 12 years. When we came to government five and a half years ago, unemployment was higher, the Budget was in deficit, debt was growing at 30 per cent a year. Over the last five and a half years - a lot like the apprentices and the workers behind us - we got under the hood, we got under the car of the Budget and we started repairing it. It’s been up on the hoist for the last five and a half years and on Tuesday night it came down off the hoist. It came down and we put the car back on the road in terms of our Budget, because it’s back into surplus.

That surplus means we can now start paying down Labor’s debt and that’s what our Budget is doing. You know, when you’re doing that, that means you can start investing more and more in the essential services that Australians rely on and the essential infrastructure. A big part of the Budget that Josh Frydenberg handed down last week, was our plan to manage population growth across the country.

Now, there are many ways that we are working to achieve the managing of our population growth. We have more sensible migration intake plans that we announced some weeks ago. I know that’s welcomed here on the Central Coast, which has been feeling the population growth pressures. It's also stronger working relationships between state, local and the Commonwealth government. It's ensuring that we're investing in the cohesion of our communities, so as we grow, we grow together, we don't grow apart. But a massive part of it, is the economic plan of investing in the infrastructure that gets people home sooner and safer, that makes that commute that little bit easier. That's why, as Lucy has just said, we've put 600 additional car spaces and car parking bays here in Gosford and 140 down in Woy Woy. 

But the other thing we're doing is we're ensuring that local economies like here on the Central Coast and in regional areas right across the country, that their own economies are growing. So you don't have to get on the train in the morning, you can have your job right here. You can work, you can play, you can live your life here where you've chosen to, on this wonderful part of the Central Coast here just north of Sydney in New South Wales. That's what we want to see Australians have; we want to see them have more choices about where they live and where they work.

But I tell you what wasn't in our Budget last week. What wasn't in our Budget last week was taking the choices off Australians, by putting their taxes up. Labor has $200 billion of higher taxes, telling hard-working Australians - many I suspect who work here and in other places of the coast, buying investment properties, trying to get ahead - they'll be hit with Labor's housing tax. The thousands of retirees that live here on the Central Coast, taking their choices away, with Labor's retiree tax. The other one we’ve seen has been revealed just in the last week and a bit; it’s what Labor is doing with their emissions reduction policy, taking the choices away from Australians of what car they even are going to drive.

What we've seen from Labor is telling Australians how they should live their lives, what car they can drive, taking their money away from them in higher taxes and removing the choices that they ultimately have about how they see their way forward.

This new policy that the Labor Party has announced is concerning at many levels, not only that Bill Shorten clearly doesn’t understand the details of his own policy. And if he doesn't understand it and he can't explain it, then you shouldn't vote for it. It's as simple as that. Because what that policy does, not just the goal of a 50 per cent electric vehicles by 2030 when we're only at 0.2 per cent now – and the Coalition doesn't have any issue at all and in fact we promote the idea of people buying electric cars, if that's what they want to choose to do - it's all about choice. We are investing in getting public charging infrastructure in place, we are investing in the new technology that would see this realised, but it will be demand-led. It will be about Australians making choices about the transitions they want to undertake.

We won't go down this mandatory route, where we've got these mandatory vehicle emission standards, emissions standards of 105 grams per kilometre, where 17 out of 20 cars being sold today, would not meet that standard. It's not just the Hilux and it's not just the Ranger, but it's the Mazda 3 and the i30 from Hyundai. These are vehicles that will not measure up to Bill Shorten's vehicle emissions standards. They're the vehicles that will be ultimately outlawed under the plan that Bill Shorten is putting on the Australian people.

But when it comings also to their policy on fuels, that will also push up the price of petrol. I don't think it's fair frankly, that if you're living here on the Central Coast, if you're living in regional areas, that you should have to pay for the choices that they’re making in the inner cities. You should be able to have your choice about the sort of vehicle you want to drive, that you want to get around in on the weekend. If you want to put the under-6s soccer team in the back of your SUV, which is done by mums and dad all over the Central Coast and around the country on a regular basis - these are the choices that Bill Shorten wants to take away with the sort of policies he's talking about.

And he can't explain the details of them, that's what should be concerning. He's had five and a half years he’s been the Leader of the Opposition and he still can't explain what the economic impact is of his emissions reduction policies. We've been up-front about it, we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to keep taxes low. We'll continue to invest in the infrastructure that supports the Central Coast and communities all around the country. We'll continue to keep Australians safe and we'll continue to keep Australians together.

Now, I'm going to ask talk Michaelia to talk about what she's been doing up here on the Central Coast. There's 16,000 small and family businesses here in this electorate of Robertson alone and they've been receiving the Budget extremely well.

SENATOR THE HON MICHAELIA CASH, MINISTER FOR SMALL AND FAMILY BUSINESS, SKILLS AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION: Well Prime Minister, it’s always fantastic to join my very good friend and sensational colleague Lucy Wicks here in the seat of Robertson on the Central Coast. But also to welcome formally to our team Jilly, our candidate for Dobell.

I love coming to the Central Coast because it really is a place where small and family businesses can thrive. It's a great place to live and Lucy and I spend a lot of time talking to small and family businesses, businesses like the one we're at here today, a family business that started in 1986 and over 30 years has literally employed thousands of apprentices over that time. But we want small and family businesses throughout Australia to know that for the Morrison Government, you are front and centre of our decision-making. We back you every step of the way.

Why? Because we understand that when a small and family business in Australia prospers and grows, they create more jobs for Australians. That's the message we are giving to the over 16,000 small and family businesses here in the seat of Robertson. In the Budget on Tuesday night, we increased the threshold of the instant asset write-off from $25,000 to $30,000. We announced it on Tuesday night and I'm very pleased to tell all of those small and family businesses out there that we legislated it on Thursday night. But what we also did, because we have a strong economy, is that we have enabled businesses now with a turnover of less than $50 million to access the instant asset write-off. This is the benefit of a strong economy. You can give these dividends back to small and family businesses and now medium-sized businesses, across Australia.

But of course we need to ensure that businesses have access to the skilled Australians that they need. That is why we have made an in excess of half a billion dollar investment in our vocational and education training system in Australia. Scott Morrison - you've heard him here today - he backs tradies every step of the way and it’s great to see a business that has employed so many apprentices over the years. In fact this morning we met Johnny, Johnny has been here for 30 years. This is the only job he has ever had. He started as an apprentice and his son has now joined him in this great family business, also undertaking an apprenticeship.

But what I worry about for people like Johnny is that the car he’s driving today, if a Labor government is ever elected, will not be the car he is driving tomorrow. In fact, if you look behind us at all of these apprentices here, 50 per cent of those apprentices will be driving an electric vehicle under Bill Shorten.

We are going to stand by our tradies and we are going to save their utes. Because we understand choice and that is what Bill Shorten is taking away from our tradies.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks, Michaelia. I'm happy to take questions.

JOURNALIST: Regarding the reports that a Chinese billionaire paid to have a meeting Peter Dutton, how do you feel about people buying time with government ministers, what message does that send?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, the individual you're referring to has actually been prevented from ever returning back to Australia. So I think when it comes to our Government acting on foreign interference, we've got a pretty strong track record. I think that compares very significantly to that of the Labor Party, where Senator Sam Dastyari had to resign in disgrace, because he not only compromised himself in standing in front of an Australian Government insignia - standing there with the very individual you're referring to -  that was a disgrace and he had to resign in disgrace.

So when it comes to countering foreign interference, my Government, our Government has put in place the legislation to ensure that we counter that foreign interference. We put around $36 million into our security agencies in the Budget last week, to ensure that they can be countering foreign interference and I think when it comes to these issues, our Government's record is squeaky clean.

JOURNALIST: As a former Immigration Minister, how many citizenship ceremonies are held in the offices of MPs and Senators each year?

PRIME MINISTER: It happens with members all around the country, all members can be swearing in citizens. When I was Immigration Minister, I had those powers and I did as a local member. So it all depends on each electorate and each individual member.

JOURNALIST: Why was Huang Xiangmo's family [inaudible] approved to have their citizenships bestowed [inaudible] Sam Dastyari’s office [inaudible] Coalition Government [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, you make reference to Sam Dastyari, I mean Sam Dastyari the Labor senator who had to resign in disgrace over his involvement in foreign interference. I mean it was an absolute disgrace. Labor's record on foreign interference is there for everyone to see and it's pin-up boy is Sam Dastyari.

JOURNALIST: [inaudible] when he made that approval, was aware of who they were or should have have known who they were?

PRIME MINISTER: All I know is Sam Dastyari had to resign in disgrace over foreign interference and behaving in a reckless and shameful way, betraying his own country.

JOURNALIST: On Adani, is the Government's intention to make a decision on the Adani mine groundwater approvals before [inaudible]?

PRIME MINSTER: The Government will make all decisions based on the expert scientific advice of organisations, including not just the Department of Environment, but Geoscience Australia and the CSIRO. So we will always make, as we have all along the way of this process, there have been many decisions made in relation to this and other projects. But in relation to this project we've always been following the advice of the scientists and we will continue to do that.

JOURNALIST: Have you counselled Senator James McGrath against issuing press releases [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: When it comes to making these decisions, they’ll be made by Ministers listening to scientists, not senators listening to themselves.

JOURNALIST: Why did you make a captain's pick in the seat of Reid and approve Fiona Martin?

PRIME MINISTER: Because I think she's an outstanding candidate and I think she’s going to do a fantastic job. With the retirement of Craig Laundy so close to the election, we're not going to waste any time, we're just going to get on with it. She's going to do a fantastic job.

JOURNALIST: Are you confident in her ability [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: I'm very confident in her ability.

JOURNALIST: Just on the Central Coast, obviously there's been a few big announcements here in the region following last week's Budget. How come it's taken until an election year to, I guess, deliver these things, here in the region?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I'm going to invite Lucy to talk to this as well, but I said before that we have a plan for managing our population and whether it's the more than $40 million that we've invested in the medical campus here - I've been up here numerous times - whether it's the investments we've been making up in the industrial areas, or the investments we've been making in the education precinct and the medical precinct here, whether it's the jobs that we've been bringing up out of big agencies like Human Services and the Tax Office, putting them here in Gosford. I mean this has been a continuous job of creating, here in Gosford on the Central Coast, a self-supporting, dynamic, future-focused economy, that gives people living on the Central Coast the opportunity to work on the Central Coast, not just live here. The person who has driven that from the day she was elected as the Member for Robertson is Lucy Wicks.

This has been Lucy's plan and her vision to see an economy that has gone from 5.1 per cent unemployment, to 4.6 per cent unemployment here in the electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast. What has driven this has been Lucy's vision for the Central Coast, being a confident, self-supporting economy that is driving jobs at the local level. That Gosford doesn't just exist as some sort of satellite outpost of Sydney, but as a thriving economy and community in it’s own right. Under Lucy's term as the Member for Robertson, we've seen Gosford go ahead in leaps and bounds. We’re working closely together with local authorities, with the state government and I think it's been paying real dividends here. And with Lucy, she's got a million more plans. She's always in my office, when I was the Treasurer, when I was the Minister for Immigration, when I was Minister for Social Services.

LUCY WICKS, FEDERAL MEMBER FOR ROBERTSON: Sorry, not sorry.

PRIME MINISTER: She's in there every single day and she is such a great champion for the Central Coast, just like Jilly will be. She's been a tremendous advocate and campaigner when it comes to road safety, when it comes to organ donation. People know that about Jilly here on the Central Coast, they know her form when it comes to doing things she believes in. This pair are going to be an absolute dynamic duo.

LUCY WICKS, FEDERAL MEMBER FOR ROBERTSON: Thank you Scott and to respond further to the question, I don't think this has got anything to do with an election year because these are not election commitments. These are Budget commitments, these are in the Budget. They are costed, they are fully funded, they are going to be delivered. Why did it take until 2019? Because we have a surplus, because we have a Government that has gotten on with the job of doing what we said we would do. Now, thanks to the fact that we are in surplus, the Budget is back in the black, we can deliver so many of the things that people on the Central Coast have wanted for years. For years we have been crying out for more commuter car parking. Scott is right, the Prime Minister is right; I would love to see the need for less commuter car parking, because I would love to see the jobs actually being available here on the Central Coast.

My ultimate dream is to see the Central Coast as a region where we're known for reverse commuting; not for commuting to Sydney and Newcastle, but for having people from those cities commute here to the Central Coast, because this is where the jobs are. That this becomes the new jobs growth hub of New South Wales and indeed one day perhaps even around Australia, that's my ultimate dream. That’s part of my plan for Robertson. But the reason you’re seeing the commitments that have been announced over the last couple of days, over the last week or so, is because of our strong, responsible economic management and the Government is listening and the Government is funding the important, essential projects that people here on the Central Coast want. Whether it be commuter car parking, whether it be the new innovation and health jobs precinct here in Gosford, building on what we've already done with the Central Coast Medical University and Medical Research Institute. Another $18 million to really take the Central Coast forward, to really see the Central Coast and Gosford in particular known as a region of world-class excellence, of opportunity, of aspiration and a place where young people don't have to go to Sydney or Newcastle to be able to pursue their educational aspirations, but they can do so right here.

Whether it be the incredibly important announcement we made just yesterday of $9 million to establish the Glen Centre for Women, to really make sure - this is one of the most important projects in the Budget, I believe, Prime Minister and I want to thank you for your personal support of that as well - to make sure that we have, the first of it’s kind, a culturally appropriate drug and alcohol rehab centre for Indigenous women and other women. Really helping them to be able to make sure that their future is not defined by their past. That was an incredible moment yesterday.

Whether it be being able to deliver a new radiotherapy machine for the outstanding cancer care clinic at Gosford, $3.8 million to make sure that cancer patients don't have to go on a waiting list. Or $8.5 million to upgrade the Umina precinct park, which is something people on the peninsula have been crying out for for a couple of years now.

PRIME MINISTER: See I told you it was a long list, I told you it was a long list. 

[Laughter]

LUCY WICKS, FEDERAL MEMBER FOR ROBERTSON: We could continue.

PRIME MINISTER: You asked the question.

LUCY WICKS, FEDERAL MEMBER FOR ROBERTSON: I'll stop.

[Laughter]

PRIME MINISTER: All of this depends on a strong economy of course and having a Government that knows how to manage money.

People know that Labor don't know how to manage money. That's why they stopped listing drugs on the affordable medicines Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme when they were last in government. That's why they drove us into deficit. That's why they drove us into debt.

You know, now we're back in the black and we’re able to invest in this and a whole range of other projects. $461 million for what I know is a really important project for the Central Coast, $461 million to combat youth suicide and youth mental health challenges around the country. There is not a community in the country that is not touched by the curse of youth suicide and youth mental health issues. That's everything from building up our young people to have strong mental health, good mental health, just in the same way as they have good physical health. From the youngest of ages, the programs, whether it's Smiling Mind, to Headspace, these are programs that are going to make our country healthier and when our country is healthier, it's stronger. When our economy is stronger, that's what we can invest back in.

You know, we face many challenges ahead. Australia is the best place in the world to live, but our future depends on keeping our economy strong. That's what our Budget last year did. That’s true, last year and last week too! So anyway, we’ll take one more and then we have to get moving.

JOURNALIST: Just lastly, obviously back to Dobell, it's a seat you lost at the last election. Jilly officially announced today, I guess [inaudible] a big advocate here on the Central Coast. Do you hope Jilly is going to do the same and get [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah sure Jilly, come forward. I'm so pleased to see Jilly selected and endorsed as our candidate and to see yet another female candidate endorsed. Since I've become Prime Minister around half of our candidates who have been selected have been women. That has happened through our choices, our decisions, our selection processes and I really welcome that. I know Jilly's story and I know the advocacy that she has pursued on behalf of Banjo, but also on road safety, on organ donation.

Jilly is a fighter. She is a fighter and the Central Coast needs fighters for the Central Coast and to make sure that their communities are getting the resources and the support that they need. I know your form and there's going to have to be two permanent seats in my office, one for Lucy and one for Jilly, because they'll be knocking the door down as Lucy always has. I really do think they're going to be a tremendous team if they're given that opportunity at next election. I think there's a great choice here. The choice is about having your choice at the end of the day.

We want you to have the choices that you want for you and your family. People have decided, made the choice, to live here on the Central Coast. People have decided they actually want to buy a car that can tow a boat, or their tinnie, or a caravan or a trailer or whatever they want. We want them to have the choices, for people to have the choice to keep more of what they earn. I think money in the hands of an Australian, is going to do a better job than money in the hands of the government. That's why I think it's better that they get to keep more of their earnings.

The real choice between Labor and Liberal at this election, is that we believe you should keep your choices. We're not going to take your choices away from you. We're going to give you more choice and that's what Jilly and Lucy stand for here on the Central Coast.

It's been great to be here with you and particularly to meet Johnny and I'm glad to see he's dragging his son out of bed every morning to get here on time and we'll take it from there.

Thanks very much.





LUCY WICKS, FEDERAL MEMBER FOR ROBERTSON: Well what a fantastic sight to see behind us so many young apprentices. So many young people, having the opportunity to work right where they live, to be able to pursue the dream that they have, to pursue a trade of their choice. That’s what we want to be able to see more of here on the Central Coast; strong family businesses like this one at the Central Coast Motor Group, an outstanding local family business that has been here on the Central Coast since 1986. They have employed thousands of people in their time and at the moment, there’s around 250 people who work at the Central Coast Motor Group.

Our dream, our Liberal and National Government’s dream is to see strong local economies like the Central Coast region become stronger and grow, to see more people being able to work where they live. We do have a challenge on the Central Coast, because too many people have to leave early in the morning and return late at night to their families, because job opportunities are more available in Sydney and Newcastle. Our dream is to see more local businesses be able to grow, thrive, prosper and succeed and employ even more local people here on the Central Coast.

It’s for that reason that I’m so delighted to be joined by my outstanding friend and colleague, the Liberal Candidate for Dobell Jilly Pillon, who is herself a small business owner here on the Central Coast, a born and bred local. She’s a great fighter for our region, she knows the importance of local jobs here on the Central Coast. She knows the importance of providing more opportunities for our young people here on the Central Coast and it’s wonderful to be joined by Jilly Pillon as the Liberal candidate for Dobell, to welcome of course the Minister for Small and Family Business Michaelia Cash and of course our outstanding Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison, who of course is a wonderful friend to the Central Coast and no stranger here. He’s been up a number of times, he’s a great supporter and somebody who always listens to the concerns, the hopes and the aspirations of people here on the Central Coast. I was delighted to be able to announce some commuter car parking for our hardworking commuters, backed by Scott Morrison. It was one of the first issues that I raised when he became Prime Minister and now we have the $35 million investment in commuter car parking, 600 new car spots for Gosford and 140 new car spots for Woy Woy. This is all part of our plan to see better infrastructure and to see more local opportunities for people here on the Central Coast.

PRIME MINISTER:  Thank you very much Lucy, it’s great to be here with you Jilly, it’s great to have you on the team and of course Michaelia Cash, who is everywhere around the country, backing and supporting small and family businesses. It’s great when you see small and family businesses become larger businesses, like the business we’re in here today. To see the apprentices that are being employed and the opportunities people are getting here.

Last week when we handed down the Budget we handed down the first surplus that we’ve seen in 12 years. When we came to government five and a half years ago, unemployment was higher, the Budget was in deficit, debt was growing at 30 per cent a year. Over the last five and a half years - a lot like the apprentices and the workers behind us - we got under the hood, we got under the car of the Budget and we started repairing it. It’s been up on the hoist for the last five and a half years and on Tuesday night it came down off the hoist. It came down and we put the car back on the road in terms of our Budget, because it’s back into surplus.

That surplus means we can now start paying down Labor’s debt and that’s what our Budget is doing. You know, when you’re doing that, that means you can start investing more and more in the essential services that Australians rely on and the essential infrastructure. A big part of the Budget that Josh Frydenberg handed down last week, was our plan to manage population growth across the country.

Now, there are many ways that we are working to achieve the managing of our population growth. We have more sensible migration intake plans that we announced some weeks ago. I know that’s welcomed here on the Central Coast, which has been feeling the population growth pressures. It's also stronger working relationships between state, local and the Commonwealth government. It's ensuring that we're investing in the cohesion of our communities, so as we grow, we grow together, we don't grow apart. But a massive part of it, is the economic plan of investing in the infrastructure that gets people home sooner and safer, that makes that commute that little bit easier. That's why, as Lucy has just said, we've put 600 additional car spaces and car parking bays here in Gosford and 140 down in Woy Woy. 

But the other thing we're doing is we're ensuring that local economies like here on the Central Coast and in regional areas right across the country, that their own economies are growing. So you don't have to get on the train in the morning, you can have your job right here. You can work, you can play, you can live your life here where you've chosen to, on this wonderful part of the Central Coast here just north of Sydney in New South Wales. That's what we want to see Australians have; we want to see them have more choices about where they live and where they work.

But I tell you what wasn't in our Budget last week. What wasn't in our Budget last week was taking the choices off Australians, by putting their taxes up. Labor has $200 billion of higher taxes, telling hard-working Australians - many I suspect who work here and in other places of the coast, buying investment properties, trying to get ahead - they'll be hit with Labor's housing tax. The thousands of retirees that live here on the Central Coast, taking their choices away, with Labor's retiree tax. The other one we’ve seen has been revealed just in the last week and a bit; it’s what Labor is doing with their emissions reduction policy, taking the choices away from Australians of what car they even are going to drive.

What we've seen from Labor is telling Australians how they should live their lives, what car they can drive, taking their money away from them in higher taxes and removing the choices that they ultimately have about how they see their way forward.

This new policy that the Labor Party has announced is concerning at many levels, not only that Bill Shorten clearly doesn’t understand the details of his own policy. And if he doesn't understand it and he can't explain it, then you shouldn't vote for it. It's as simple as that. Because what that policy does, not just the goal of a 50 per cent electric vehicles by 2030 when we're only at 0.2 per cent now – and the Coalition doesn't have any issue at all and in fact we promote the idea of people buying electric cars, if that's what they want to choose to do - it's all about choice. We are investing in getting public charging infrastructure in place, we are investing in the new technology that would see this realised, but it will be demand-led. It will be about Australians making choices about the transitions they want to undertake.

We won't go down this mandatory route, where we've got these mandatory vehicle emission standards, emissions standards of 105 grams per kilometre, where 17 out of 20 cars being sold today, would not meet that standard. It's not just the Hilux and it's not just the Ranger, but it's the Mazda 3 and the i30 from Hyundai. These are vehicles that will not measure up to Bill Shorten's vehicle emissions standards. They're the vehicles that will be ultimately outlawed under the plan that Bill Shorten is putting on the Australian people.

But when it comings also to their policy on fuels, that will also push up the price of petrol. I don't think it's fair frankly, that if you're living here on the Central Coast, if you're living in regional areas, that you should have to pay for the choices that they’re making in the inner cities. You should be able to have your choice about the sort of vehicle you want to drive, that you want to get around in on the weekend. If you want to put the under-6s soccer team in the back of your SUV, which is done by mums and dad all over the Central Coast and around the country on a regular basis - these are the choices that Bill Shorten wants to take away with the sort of policies he's talking about.

And he can't explain the details of them, that's what should be concerning. He's had five and a half years he’s been the Leader of the Opposition and he still can't explain what the economic impact is of his emissions reduction policies. We've been up-front about it, we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to keep taxes low. We'll continue to invest in the infrastructure that supports the Central Coast and communities all around the country. We'll continue to keep Australians safe and we'll continue to keep Australians together.

Now, I'm going to ask talk Michaelia to talk about what she's been doing up here on the Central Coast. There's 16,000 small and family businesses here in this electorate of Robertson alone and they've been receiving the Budget extremely well.

SENATOR THE HON MICHAELIA CASH, MINISTER FOR SMALL AND FAMILY BUSINESS, SKILLS AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION: Well Prime Minister, it’s always fantastic to join my very good friend and sensational colleague Lucy Wicks here in the seat of Robertson on the Central Coast. But also to welcome formally to our team Jilly, our candidate for Dobell.

I love coming to the Central Coast because it really is a place where small and family businesses can thrive. It's a great place to live and Lucy and I spend a lot of time talking to small and family businesses, businesses like the one we're at here today, a family business that started in 1986 and over 30 years has literally employed thousands of apprentices over that time. But we want small and family businesses throughout Australia to know that for the Morrison Government, you are front and centre of our decision-making. We back you every step of the way.

Why? Because we understand that when a small and family business in Australia prospers and grows, they create more jobs for Australians. That's the message we are giving to the over 16,000 small and family businesses here in the seat of Robertson. In the Budget on Tuesday night, we increased the threshold of the instant asset write-off from $25,000 to $30,000. We announced it on Tuesday night and I'm very pleased to tell all of those small and family businesses out there that we legislated it on Thursday night. But what we also did, because we have a strong economy, is that we have enabled businesses now with a turnover of less than $50 million to access the instant asset write-off. This is the benefit of a strong economy. You can give these dividends back to small and family businesses and now medium-sized businesses, across Australia.

But of course we need to ensure that businesses have access to the skilled Australians that they need. That is why we have made an in excess of half a billion dollar investment in our vocational and education training system in Australia. Scott Morrison - you've heard him here today - he backs tradies every step of the way and it’s great to see a business that has employed so many apprentices over the years. In fact this morning we met Johnny, Johnny has been here for 30 years. This is the only job he has ever had. He started as an apprentice and his son has now joined him in this great family business, also undertaking an apprenticeship.

But what I worry about for people like Johnny is that the car he’s driving today, if a Labor government is ever elected, will not be the car he is driving tomorrow. In fact, if you look behind us at all of these apprentices here, 50 per cent of those apprentices will be driving an electric vehicle under Bill Shorten.

We are going to stand by our tradies and we are going to save their utes. Because we understand choice and that is what Bill Shorten is taking away from our tradies.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks, Michaelia. I'm happy to take questions.

JOURNALIST: Regarding the reports that a Chinese billionaire paid to have a meeting Peter Dutton, how do you feel about people buying time with government ministers, what message does that send?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, the individual you're referring to has actually been prevented from ever returning back to Australia. So I think when it comes to our Government acting on foreign interference, we've got a pretty strong track record. I think that compares very significantly to that of the Labor Party, where Senator Sam Dastyari had to resign in disgrace, because he not only compromised himself in standing in front of an Australian Government insignia - standing there with the very individual you're referring to -  that was a disgrace and he had to resign in disgrace.

So when it comes to countering foreign interference, my Government, our Government has put in place the legislation to ensure that we counter that foreign interference. We put around $36 million into our security agencies in the Budget last week, to ensure that they can be countering foreign interference and I think when it comes to these issues, our Government's record is squeaky clean.

JOURNALIST: As a former Immigration Minister, how many citizenship ceremonies are held in the offices of MPs and Senators each year?

PRIME MINISTER: It happens with members all around the country, all members can be swearing in citizens. When I was Immigration Minister, I had those powers and I did as a local member. So it all depends on each electorate and each individual member.

JOURNALIST: Why was Huang Xiangmo's family [inaudible] approved to have their citizenships bestowed [inaudible] Sam Dastyari’s office [inaudible] Coalition Government [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, you make reference to Sam Dastyari, I mean Sam Dastyari the Labor senator who had to resign in disgrace over his involvement in foreign interference. I mean it was an absolute disgrace. Labor's record on foreign interference is there for everyone to see and it's pin-up boy is Sam Dastyari.

JOURNALIST: [inaudible] when he made that approval, was aware of who they were or should have have known who they were?

PRIME MINISTER: All I know is Sam Dastyari had to resign in disgrace over foreign interference and behaving in a reckless and shameful way, betraying his own country.

JOURNALIST: On Adani, is the Government's intention to make a decision on the Adani mine groundwater approvals before [inaudible]?

PRIME MINSTER: The Government will make all decisions based on the expert scientific advice of organisations, including not just the Department of Environment, but Geoscience Australia and the CSIRO. So we will always make, as we have all along the way of this process, there have been many decisions made in relation to this and other projects. But in relation to this project we've always been following the advice of the scientists and we will continue to do that.

JOURNALIST: Have you counselled Senator James McGrath against issuing press releases [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: When it comes to making these decisions, they’ll be made by Ministers listening to scientists, not senators listening to themselves.

JOURNALIST: Why did you make a captain's pick in the seat of Reid and approve Fiona Martin?

PRIME MINISTER: Because I think she's an outstanding candidate and I think she’s going to do a fantastic job. With the retirement of Craig Laundy so close to the election, we're not going to waste any time, we're just going to get on with it. She's going to do a fantastic job.

JOURNALIST: Are you confident in her ability [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: I'm very confident in her ability.

JOURNALIST: Just on the Central Coast, obviously there's been a few big announcements here in the region following last week's Budget. How come it's taken until an election year to, I guess, deliver these things, here in the region?

It's been great to be here with you and particularly to meet Johnny and I'm glad to see he's dragging his son out of bed every morning to get here on time and we'll take it from there.

Thanks very much.

POST BUDGET ADDRESS

PRIME MINISTER: How good is Trevor Evans? I’ll tell you how good he is.

[Interruption]

So, how good is Trevor Evans?

[Applause]

Take two. Do we have a contestant number three? Okay, on your tables are 40 great reasons why Trevor Evans is doing a tremendous job here in Brisbane. I see a lot of great local members and they’re all on my team. And there are none better than Trevor. The way that he’s applied himself to the role, whether it’s with infrastructure, whether it’s in small business support, whether it is indeed the environment. Whether it’s supporting local sport, I’ve just come from an announcement with Trevor today, supporting local sport here in this community. This what good local members do and you are I think, in great shape with the tremendous work that Trevor has done for your community. I’m really pleased to be here with him again.

This is the third year running that I’ve been up in Brisbane after the Budget. The first time was when we were together with the Chamber up in town, it’s great to be back here with you today, to be here talking about the Budget and Trevor has played such an important part.

Can I also, before we get going much further, acknowledge the traditional Indigenous owners of the land, their elders past, present and emerging. Can I also acknowledge any veterans or servicemen and women who are in the room today. I say simply, on behalf of all Australians, as one Australian to another, thank you for your service.

When I was here earlier this year with Trevor, we were down at the Brothers Rugby Club and I talked that day about an important commitment I was making to Australia. I was outlining once again the strong economic plan that we’ve been pursuing as a Government for the last five and a half years. As a result of that plan, as Josh Frydenberg said when he handed down the Budget last week, unemployment is lower. There are more Australians in jobs, particularly more women in jobs. He talked about how youth employment had particularly grown and how we’ve now set a record for the strongest growth in youth employment, people aged 15 -24 in a financial year, in Australia’s history. We talked about how we’d gotten spending under control, to ensure that we have the lowest growth in Commonwealth expenditure of any Government in 50 years. How we’ve gotten taxes under control and how we as a result of all of this, have been able to bring the Budget back to the first surplus we’ve seen in 12 years.

On that day, I made an important commitment, I said our Government’s economic plan would deliver 1.24 million new jobs over the next five years.  Now I’ll tell you how that’s going to happen. You’re going to make it happen. Small and family businesses, medium-sized business, businesses around the country, are the ones who are going to make that happen. How do I know that? Because that’s what you’ve just done. Over 1.2 million jobs have been created since we were first elected back in 2013. Today there are more people who are employed in this country of working age, than at any other time in our country’s history. It is extraordinary. The last time we were in that sort of shape, was back in 2007. In the last 12-18 months we have eclipsed the proportion of Australians of working age in employment, that was previously set by the Howard Government. That was the same Government that left Australia with a $20 billion surplus, $40 billion in the bank. Which, when Labor was elected soon after that, they turned into a $27 billion deficit. A series of deficits which plunged this nation into debt.

I know he’s a son of Brisbane - Swanny was leaving the Parliament this week, just the week passed, in Budget week and I was able to say quite honestly and quite truthfully, that we are in Swanny’s debt.

[Laughter]

Think about it, literally we are in Swanny’s debt. But I’ll be kind to him on the basis that he’s a Queenslander and I’m in Queensland today but the legacy is of debt. The legacy is of debt that we’ve been living with as we’ve worked hard to repair the finances of this country. And we’ve brought it back to the point where we were able stand up this last week and announce the first surplus Budget we’ve reached in 12 years.

“So what?” some people will say. What does that mean? What does that matter to me? Okay, you’ve achieved a surplus, so what?

The first step in paying down debt is, you’ve got to get the Budget back into surplus. If we don’t get the Budget back into surplus, then we would be putting a burden on our kids forever. Last time around, when we were in Government the Howard and Costello Government paid off the debt in a decade and that is now our mission. Having achieved step one and gotten the Budget back into a surplus position, we will now be able to start paying down that debt.

And indeed we’ll pay down around $50 billion of it over the next four years and that debt will be gone within a decade or sooner, as a result of pursuing the economic and financial management policies that we have put in place.

Why does that matter? Because the interest bill on debt is about $18 billion. ‘18 thousand million dollars’ and we’ll reduce that on an annual basis by around about $5 billion a year over the next four years. That is a lot of investment we can make back into the services that Australians rely on.

It’s taken us 12 years to get back here and I think it’s important to reflect on this. Whether it’s getting people back into work, or getting the Budget back in the black, it has taken us more than a decade to get back there.

If you vote Labor once, you pay for it for a decade. That’s the lesson of the last time a government was changed from a Liberal National parties to the Labor Party. I think that’s a sobering message and why the contrasting message is so much more important; that is, you vote Liberal, you vote LNP here in Queensland and you can look forward to an economy that’s even stronger, where businesses are backed in.

I remember the last election, at the last election after the Budget that we handed down in 2016, reducing taxes, particularly on small and family businesses, businesses with a turnover between $2 million and $10 million a year. Labor weren’t even prepared to back that. We lifted the definition of small business, now legislated, from $2 million to $10 million. Thousands upon thousands of businesses, employing millions of Australian and Labor said “no”. “No, we want them to pay the highest rate in tax”.

But over the last three years our arguments prevailed. The commitments we made at the last election, to reduce that tax burden on small and family businesses have been delivered and beyond what we said we would achieve. Because in this Budget, we have announced that the instant asset write-off goes to companies with a turnover of up to $50 million. You know those companies, you are those companies and you employ more than half of the people who go to work every day in this country, more than half.

We have delivered a lower rate of tax for those businesses, so you can invest more in the future of those businesses. You can employ more people, invest in developing new products, expanding your markets. In this Budget, we’ve made further allocations available for the export market development grants. Why? Because we get it, that your businesses success is what lifts your employee’s wages. It’s what drives revenues.

[Interruption]

I’ll come to climate, don’t worry about that. These investment policies for small and family businesses, investing in their future and investing in their employees. You know, one of the things –

[Interruption]

Okay, what I was saying is that this economy that we have been building together, by backing small and family businesses, does something very important. It has enabled us to increase funding for schools, public schools and hospitals by more than 60 per cent over the last five and a half years. It has enabled us to invest and improve the funding for Medicare by 27 per cent. It has enabled us to ensure that bulk-billing for Medicare in this country is at the highest level on record. See, a strong economy is what enables a government to invest in the essential services that Australians rely on. Not higher taxes.

See the more Labor can’t control their spending, the more they have to tax.

The more they tax, the more it slows the economy.

The more it does that, the less there is for hospitals, for schools, for Medicare and for meeting all of the promises they will talk about between now and the next election.

So the question was, what matters a surplus? What matters the economy? What it matters, that is what enables our great Australian society to be as great as it is. To invest in affordable medicines, some $9 billion alone that we’ve invested in 130 cancer medicines to take these courses from hundreds of thousands of dollars for individual medicines and take it down to $6.50 for a concession holder and just 40 bucks for everyone else. That is the mark of a truly great society. I think it’s one of Australia’s greatest achievements. What I know is, we’ve been able to list of these drugs, because of our Budget management and because of the economy that you have been creating and that we have put the fundamentals in place for you to be successful.

And when Labor was last in power, they stopped listing medicines. They stopped it because they ran out of money. So their approach this time is this; every time Bill Shorten looks in his wallet, know that he’ll be looking in yours. Because every time he’s spending, he’s going to be taxing you more and he’s going to be sending you the bill.

Bill will always send you the bill. 

[Laughter]

On every single occasion. Because if you can’t control your spending, you can’t control your taxes. This is the real, earnest point that I have been urging Australians to reflect on and why the economy is so important; I remember when I went out of university all those years ago, just as young people are going out to university and coming out of apprentices - or perhaps going into them, I met some of them down at Yatala earlier today – that was the decade of the recession, the one that we apparently had to have. That was the decade of the record interest rates that crippled small and family businesses and sent them to the wall. It cause mortgage holders to groan, all apparently what Labor said we “had to have” at that time.

I never want to see an Australian have to face that ever again, ever.

Most of us here would have lived through that at the time. You know, one in two voters at this election, one in two Australians who are voting at this election will never have lived through a recession during their working life. I think that’s a great thing, I think it’s tremendous. I think it’s one of Australia’s greatest achievement. I don’t want my kids or your kids, or anyone else’s kids coming out of school or university, entering into a decade like many of us did a generation or so ago. That’s what Liberal and National policies are designed to achieve; to keep us out of those sort of dangers.

You know, we are facing some twists and turns in the economic road ahead. There’s some dangerous, slippery surfaces down the road and you do not hand the economic wheel over in those circumstances, to someone who doesn’t know how to drive.

If you look at the leader of the Labor Party’s policies on the economy, you can only describe them that way. The risks are great. The housing market is soft, the international trading environment is difficult. The uncertainty that is present, we all know about it. What we need is the stability that our continued economic management can deliver on.

So that’s what this Budget was about; keeping taxes low, both for individuals and for small and family businesses. NCSAEM, their recognized independent modelling belled the cat on Labor. They’ve made it pretty clear that the average full-time wage earner in this country will be $1,000 better off under the Liberals and Nationals than they would be under the Labor Party. That is our record. That's what we've legislated and the same is true for smaller family businesses, who will be better off under a Government that understands the pressures on them and is delivering the policies on taxation, that has already delivered taking their tax rates down to 25 percent.

We're investing in the infrastructure. $100 billion which will continue to transform our economy. $100 billion which most recently include  $4 billion right here in Queensland. $425 million for the Bruce Highway announced specifically in this Budget. $100 million for the Gladstone Port Access Road. We’ve got $800 million in there for the Gateway Motorway, for Bracken Ridge to Pine River and then there's the very important urban congestion fund which is enabling us to manage population growth. You won't find a population growth plan anywhere in Labor's policies. We have a population growth plan that deals with sensible migration intake, coordination between state, local and federal governments, investing in the cohesion of our communities, so our communities grow together as we go forward, not grow apart. But it particularly delivers that congestion-busting infrastructure. The Lindum Crossing, there's $85 million for that. There’s the Indooroopilly Roundabout, $25 million, the Gympie Arterial Road at $50 million, the Newnham Wrecker Road intersection an upgrade there of $12 million. These are just some of the pinch points that make a big difference to our cities functioning. That is if you like the economic science, if you like, behind the Budget that we outlined last week; understanding the needs and the things that need to be done.

We are backing those who are investing in skills 80,000 more and new apprentices. We're backing our rural and regional communities here in Queensland, no less so than those who have suffered one of the most horrific natural disasters west of the range, in north Queensland where we have been quick to respond. Whether it was in Townsville where $39 million in in flood support went out the door within one week, within one week in north Queensland. I'll tell you what; they knew the Commonwealth Government was there standing with them, when that was happening. And over the range out to Cloncurry and Julia Creek, in Richmond, Hughenden and all through those parts, they know we're standing with them, through there through the north Queensland livestock industry recover agency which Shane Stone is heading up and delivering a programme of reform which will enable all of those pastoralists to rebuild what is a very important part of Australia and our economic success into the future.

When we make these investments, we enable ourselves to invest $461 million dollars in the biggest plan to combat youth suicide in this country and youth mental health challenges. And the value will be no different, no different at all from the pressures that are involved in young people just trying to get through each day to day. It is a curse on our society and we're going to break that curse by working together to tackle youth suicide, with Headspace programs and building up the mental health of young people right from the very young age. We've learned so much through people like Dr Pat McGorry and others who have invested so much in our understanding of how we can address these issues. We are investing in them and we are backing them, in just like we're backing small family businesses around the country.

So there's much more to do as we go into this next election. And there is an alternative and it's an alternative that causes me to stop and pause and reflect on the sort of economy that might otherwise be lived in if we don't stick to the current course.

We are investing in reducing our emissions. It's been raised already as you've noticed in today’s discussion. We've invested $3.5 billion in meeting our targets. You see our Government inherited not just a fiscal deficit when we came to power, our Government inherited a climate deficit from the Labor Party when we came to office. To meet our Kyoto 2020 targets we were off - inherited from the Labor Party - more than 700 million tonnes of carbon abatement when came to office. That's the track we were on, courtesy of the Labor Party before we came to office. We are now going to beat that target in 2020, by 369 million tonnes. A 1.1 billion carbon tonnes turnaround, delivered not by wrecking the economy, not by putting the price up on everything, not by telling you what car to drive. But just by doing sensible things that have reduced our emissions and met our targets.

See as Liberals and Nationals, when we make a promise, we deliver it. We make the commitment, we keep it. And we've committed to our 2030 targets and we're going to meet them and we've set out a plan to meet them. We are going to, of course, use the carry over credits that we have earned because of our ability to overachieve and on our Kyoto 2020 targets. I mean why you wouldn’t use those would be beyond me, I mean it’d be like getting to half time and you’re 12 points up ad you go; “You know, what? I think we’ll send the score back to zero all,” for the second half. Who would do that? We’ve achieved as a country. There are so many other countries who don't want to use those carry over credits. You know why? They don't have any. We do. We earned them, we’ve achieved them, you’ve achieved them.

When Australia goes forward, I'm not going to hold you back. I'm not going to increase the burden. I'm not going to increase the penalty and that's what Labor's policies do if they're given that opportunity. 

We have a positive plan. We have a plan that has been keeping our economy strong, so we can invest in the essential services Australians rely on.

We've got a strong plan to keep Australians safe, as we have whether it's on our borders or whether it's supporting our Defence forces on their deployments all around the world. Or their new capability, 2 per cent of GDP which we will achieve in 2021 ahead of schedule. Or whether it's the threat of $326 million we're investing in the Fourth National Action Plan on domestic violence Or whether it's legislating - as we did last week - to hold social media companies to account and not allow these social media platforms to be weaponized by terrorists. That's what we do. We take action and we take it now, on every single occasion.

And we're keeping Australians together, whether it’s building sporting facilities for girls to have change rooms at the cricket oval, or the AFL oval, or the rugby league, or whichever sport you’re picking, the basketball court, hockey field. We want girls and boys to be able to engage in our great sporting life in this country and we're seeing that happening. It's a great thrill because it brings communities together.

We are investing in the social harmony of our cities and we're reaching out to our fellow Australians in rural and regional areas and giving them the support they need, to stand with them as they go through the toughest drought that they've seen in generations.

This is what we're doing. Now is not the time to turn back. Now is not the time to turn away from the strong course we're on.

You know Labor, they haven't changed. They haven't changed and that means they will change it all if they're given the opportunity to once again run this country. We will remain committed to the course we have set, the strength of our economy, the safety of our citizens and the togetherness and unity of our people. That's what we set out in this Budget and I know that's what Trevor is standing for here, right here in the middle of Brisbane. I want to thank you, those of you who've been supporting him in that in that great task. We will continue to deliver the country that all Australians deserve. That's our promise to Australia. That's a promise we're making, it's a promise that will always stand and be respected and honoured by the Liberal and National parties.

Thank you so much for your attention today.

[Applause]

DOORSTOP, YATALA

Our strong Budget for a strong economy; Labor’s big new taxes; electric cars; anti-farm activists; Adani.
BERT VAN MANEN, MEMBER FOR FORDE: Well good morning and thank you to Gary and Cameron for welcoming us here to GCI this morning. It's a terrific local family-owned business and I'd also like to welcome the Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Senator Amanda Stoker. It's another terrific example of a local business that is out there every single day manufacturing goods for Australians. But also most importantly, employing Australians. We've seen this business over the years continue to grow and prosper and importantly this business benefits directly from the changes we’ve  made in the Budget last week, with the increase to $50 million dollars in turnover for the instant asset write off eligibility. But also importantly in our job skills package, we’ve got a company here that employs 12 apprentices. It’s involved with our local schools and does this stuff that continues to create opportunity for everyday Australians. So again thank you for allowing us to come down here today, it’s greatly appreciated. It's not the first time I've been here, I regularly visit and they do a tremendous job. I'd like to invite the Prime Minister to say a few words.

PRIME MINISTER: Well thanks very much Bert. The reason I'm here today is because this business is why the Australian economy is stronger today than it was when we came to government five and a half years ago, this business here today demonstrates why we've had record employment growth. It demonstrates why we've got more apprentices coming into the Australian economy. It demonstrates why Australian manufacturing is here and alive and well and thriving, because of the entrepreneurship and because of the investment that has been taking place over the last five and a half years. Over 120 employees here, we've got a dozen apprentices here. We've got a business that's between $10 million and $50 million in turnover, that is benefiting already from the fact that they're playing lower taxes under our Government.

Businesses will be benefiting from last week, to the instant asset write off which we’ve extended to companies up to $50 million in turnover. We've extended that instant asset write-off to $30,000 for each and every item. Businesses that benefit from the apprenticeship subsidies and support for apprentices themselves, which will create 80,000 new apprenticeships right across Australia, this is actually what makes our economy stronger. This is what is building our economy. Because at the centre of everything - more funding for hospitals, up more than 60 percent since we came to government, more funding for public schools up more than 60 percent since we came to government, more funding for Medicare up 27 percent and the highest level of bulk-billing that our country has ever seen - all that is made possible by businesses just like this.

When we back these businesses in, as we have been doing with lower taxes and supportive economic policies, it means they can continue to build our economy to secure your future. That's what last week's Budget was all about; it's all about businesses like this employing more Australians, being more successful, keeping more of what they earn and their employees keeping more of what they earn.

As the NCSAEM modelling, the independent modeling has shown, people on average wages will be $1,000 better off under the Liberal tax plan than under Labor's tax plan.

Of course we've been out there backing these businesses for a long time. I remember being here with Bert at the last election and we were talking about reducing taxes for businesses just like this. The Labor Party opposed us. They opposed us every step of the way. They went to the last election saying this business should pay higher taxes. We won that election on the basis of reducing their taxes and supporting small and family businesses, right across Australia including here in Queensland and south east Queensland.

So that's all part of our plan to build our economy and secure our future. I'll tell you what's not in our plan; what's not in our plan is higher taxes. What's not in our plan is Labor's reckless emissions targets. Their reckless carbon targets, that is not only will drive up the prices and drive up the cost of doing business for businesses just like this one, with higher electricity prices, but it’s a war on the weekend, when it comes to the vehicle you drive and the vehicle you want to choose. The sort of vehicles that Bill Shorten wants you to drive, you can't get one for less than $45,000 and it won't tow that boat. It won't tow that trailer. It won't get you to a favorite camping spot, as well. That's part of Australian’s way of life. What Bill Shorten is seeking to do is take away your choices. They've learned nothing, but they will change at all if they're elected.

So I'm really pleased to be here today. It's all part of our plan to build our economy, to secure your future. It's a really good plan for Queenslanders and I'm going ask Amanda to talk a bit about that, then happy to take some questions.

SENATOR FOR QUEENSLAND, AMANDA STOKER: Thank you, good morning. Well might be hear in Yatala right now checking out GCI, this is wonderful local business. But we see businesses like this doing great work right across the state. Whether you're in Rockie or Emerald or Roma or right here, you see the benefits of the Liberal Nationals commitment to growing business. Labor like to pretend that enterprise and growing business is a dirty word, it's a dirty concept. But there's a very good reason we do it; the reason we fight to make it easier for businesses like this to stay in business and to grow, is because of the people who work for them. There's 140 people working here, a dozen apprentices getting their start in their career. But there's 7.7 million Australians in workplaces just like this. When we give them chances to grow, we give chances for all Australians to succeed, chances for all Australians to reach their goals and to reach their potential.

That's why it's so great to be here sharing many of the benefits that come from the Budget for businesses just like this one. Thanks.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks Amanda and we’ve got a new partner for you down here on the Coast. Tell us a bit more about who is running down here in Moncrieff?

BERT VAN MANEN, MEMBER FOR FORDE: Well, wonderful news over the weekend, to see local businesswoman Angie Bell being preselected for the LNP for the federal seat of Moncrieff. I rang Angie and congratulated her on Saturday and I look forward to working with her through the upcoming election. But more importantly, welcoming her to Canberra as part of the Coalition team and the Government after the next federal election. But terrific news, to see another terrific local businessperson preselected as part of the LNP team going forward.                      

PRIME MINISTER: Great to have Angie Bell on the team.

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible] weekend was a bit extreme wasn’t it, what do you say, are they going to destroy the Australian way of life?

PRIME MINISTER: Well what I'm saying is Bill Shorten is not going to give people a choice in the future. I mean, electric vehicles currently make up 0.2 percent of the vehicles market, for new vehicles in Australia. He believes he can take it to 50 per cent in 10 years.  But it's not just that, it's also the carbon emissions per kilometre that he’s imposing on the Australian economy. Now there's only two out of 20 top selling vehicles in this country that go anywhere near Labor’s standard. So your Hilux, that's out, according to Bill Shorten. Even the Hyundai i30 does not meet Bill Shorten’s carbon emissions standard for vehicles. So what Australians have always expressed a preference for, is the vehicles that have a bit of grunt, have a bit of power, because they like to enjoy the great recreational opportunities that are out there. What Bill Shorten wants to corral Australians into as part of his plan, is out of the sort of lifestyles that are supported by the vehicles they're currently buying. So I think it just shows he doesn't get how Australians like to live. I think what he's saying with his new carbon policy when it comes to vehicle emissions standards, it’s one that really is taking choice away from Australians.

Now I support people buying electric cars. We've got our own plan that is designed to facilitate that, but we're leaving the choice in the hands of Australians. That's what we're doing. We're letting them have the choice, Bill Shorten wants to take that choice away. This is what I mean when I say Bill Shorten, he wants to change it all. They have learned nothing, they’ve changed nothing in terms of how they go about politics and policy - but they will change it all, with higher taxes and encroaching on the very choices that Australians want to continue to make.

JOURNALIST: Newspoll this morning is slightly better than Ipsos, but you are starting from behind, correct? Do you agree that you’re the underdog in the campaign?

PRIME MINISTER: We’ve been the underdog in this campaign right from the outset. What I know is Bill Shorten has already measured up the curtains and for all I know, he's probably gone out and bought the curtains. But my suggestion is he should keep the receipt, because I think the Australian people will have a bit more to say. Because what we've seen with Bill Shorten, particularly on his reckless carbon emissions policy is he's not across the detail of his own policy. And if he can't explain it, if he doesn't understand it, how can he expect Australians to. And if you don't understand it don't vote for it.

I mean Labor is about lies and higher taxes, that's what you'll see over the course of this campaign. We're about building our economy to secure your future, to back in businesses like this. We understand that if you want to list more medicines, affordable medicine on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which takes drugs from hundreds of thousands per course, down to $6.50 for a concession and just over $40 dollars for another patient, the only way you can do that is by ensuring you have a stronger economy and a balanced Budget.

Labor once promised before that they would list all these affordable medicines. But when they were in government they stopped doing it, because they ran out of money, because they don't know how to manage money.

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible] turn those polls around and –

PRIME MINISTER: Our Budget sets out once again our plan for a stronger economy to secure and guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. The resources for doing that, come out of success of the business that we're standing in today. Backing in small and family businesses all around the country, keeping taxes down and investing a $100 billion in our infrastructure, that not only bust congestion and upgrades things like the M1 here in south east Queensland getting people home sooner and safer, it gets workers to work sooner and safer, it gets tradies onsite out of the traffic jam.

We've got a plan for managing Australia's population growth. Labor has no such plan. Every time you hear Bill Shorten lips moving, he's increasing his taxes. Every time he opens his wallet, he's opening yours.

You will get the bill from Bill Shorten, for each and every thing.

JOURNALIST: Do you concede you can’t win?

PRIME MINISTER: Not at all, not at all. You know our Government has always backed the hard work and effort of Australians. That's what we believe in, that's what we're backing in and I'm very pleased to go to an election backing in Australians who are working hard and saying to them; “I want you to keep more of what you earn.” I know Australia gets stronger by the hard work of all Australians.

I don't believe you need to set one group of Australians against another. I don't think that one worker gets a pay rise, by having to sack another. That's Bill Shorten plan.

My plan is to grow our economy so all Australians can benefit and they can share in their own hard work and rewards.

JOURNALIST: Just on another subject, animal activists have this morning brought the Melbourne CBD to a standstill. They’ve chained themselves to [inaudible]. What’s your message to them and what can you do?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think state and territory governments should ensure that the full force of the law is brought against these green collar criminals. I can also say for those who are out there attacking our farmers, our farmers that are going through some of the hardest conditions that we've seen in this country for more than a century in some cases - facing floods, facing drought - these farmers, these graziers, these pastoralists are subject to the indecent attacks of green collar criminals.

Now last Friday, we introduced and made regulations which are now in effect that subjects “Aussie farms,” this activist group, to the full force of the privacy laws in this country. They can face fines of almost up to $500,000 for the sorts of things - potentially - that they're engaged in. But I also say this; if there are pastoralists and farmers or graziers or groups that are in a position to actually bring a civil action against these groups, these green collar criminals who are looking to undermine their livelihood and the economy of the Australian people then the Commonwealth is totally open to supporting them in a test case, to show these green collar criminals that you don't get to go and pull the rug from under our Aussie farmers.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister will the Government sign off on the Adani project?

PRIME MINISTER: We're taking the advice from scientists, like we have on all the approvals and both the Queensland State Government the Commonwealth have been considering a large number of these approvals. There are some remaining on some very administrative matters, there's sub-approvals for early approvals. So we're following the normal administrative process on that. We'll be taking the advice of the scientists when it comes to making those decisions. I don't think there is anything particularly unique about these remaining matters. They are quite minor matters in the scheme of the broader approvals that have already been provided. Like in all the other cases, we will be relying on the scientific evidence that is provided to the government in making those decisions. Thanks very much.

JOURNALIST: When is the election?

PRIME MINISTER: May. Right, thanks guys.

DOORSTOP, GOOGONG NSW

Tax relief; Budget; Labor’s $200 billion worth of taxes; Huggies factory closure; NDIS; Indigenous recognition
DR FIONA KOTVOJS, LIBERAL CANDIDATE FOR EDEN-MONARO: Good morning, I’m Fiona Kotvojs, the Liberal candidate for Eden-Monaro and I'm really pleased to be here in Googong today. Googong is one of the real growth centres in our area and it's about a third of it has been constructed. But it's really growing and it's fantastic to see such a thriving area. I’m pleased to be here with James from Vogue Construction and all of the work that's being done here. And I’d particularly like to extend the welcome to our Prime Minister Scott Morrison for coming and having a look and discussing what's happening here today with apprentices and in the construction industry. Prime Minister.

PRIME MINISTER: Well thank you Dr Kotvojs, thank Fiona. It's great to be back here in Googong again with you and with Jim and of course with Michaelia and James. Good on you James. James and his family have been a pioneer of the ACT region for many, many, many years and have been a real champion of the economic development around this district for a long time. Look, the reason we're here today is because this is what our Budget is about. What's happening here on this site. Apprentices. Getting jobs and getting trades. And to one day go on and run their own businesses. A housing industry that here in New South Wales and the ACT district is thriving. Creating jobs, creating opportunities. Young families being able to come and buy homes and invest in their future. And be able to get ahead and realise their dreams and their aspirations. These are the things that we're championing as a Government.

What you see right around here is people who are having a go and they're getting a fair go. And I want that to continue because a fair go for those who have a go is what sits at the heart of our Budget. 80,000 additional apprenticeships to be provided as a result of the skills package that we announced in the Budget on Tuesday night. Small businesses and family businesses like Vogue Constructions here. I mean, these are businesses that will benefit from the $30,000 instant asset write off and taking their taxes down to 25 per cent. I remember it well. The Labor Party opposed the 25 per cent tax rate for businesses between $2 and $10 million. They opposed it. They fought it. They eventually rolled over. But they tried to stop businesses like this one right here from getting the tax cut to 25 per cent.

Now we're extending the instant asset write off to businesses with a turnover to up to $50 million. Because we understand that small and family and medium sized businesses is what what drives the economy. More than half of the Australian workforce is employed by businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million. And that's particularly the case when you get out of the big cities. When you get into the regions, when you get out in the rural parts of Australia, those are the businesses that sustain the livelihoods of Australians. And that's why they need the investment that we're making in congestion busting infrastructure. Housing estates like this all around the country. If you find them in south east Queensland, over in Perth, or down in Melbourne, or in Sydney. You'll find these housing estates and the people who live in these estates want to be able to get home sooner and get home safer. And that's why our congestion busting package that we announced in the Budget this year is helping them.

So everywhere you look on this site - whether it's the concrete pour that will continue to keep happening under our Government, that you'll pay more for under a Labor government with their reckless emissions targets that will be just a dead weight on the Australian economy. You know, you don't have to choose between a clean environment and a strong economy. You don't have to sell one out to achieve the other. That's what our policies are designed to ensure that we don't do - that you can have both, that you can ensure that you can have the ambition and the realising of that ambition for a clean environment and a strong economy. So these pours and these sites and these jobs and these apprenticeships can continue to be achieved. That's what will drive the economy forward. That's what will drive wage increases into the future. That's what will support the stronger economy that underpins a balanced Budget over the next decade. You don't do it by increasing taxes. You will not get a stronger economy by putting the dead weight of $200 billion in higher taxes on the Australian economy. Some of you probably know I like to swim a few laps - I'll tell you what, it gets a lot harder if you put a weight belt on and that's what Labor will do to our economy with $200 billion of higher taxes.

So our plan is quite the opposite - record investments in our essential services at hospitals and schools. Record investments in Medicare already delivered with more to come. All made possible by the strong economy which has been delivered by the people working right here on this site. Training, getting apprenticeships, getting skills, building homes, building our economy. Michaelia, we were able to pass the instant asset write off last night through the Senate?

SENATOR THE HON MICHAELIA CASH, MINISTER FOR SMALL AND FAMILY BUSINESS, SKILLS AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION: Absolutely, Prime Minister. As the Minister for Small and Family Business, I'm absolutely delighted that small and family business, the backbone of the Australian economy, employing 5.7 million Australians, they were front and centre of our Budget on Tuesday night. And Prime Minister you are right - we've increased the instant asset write off to $30,000. But on top of that because we have a strong economy, because we've put in place the right economic framework, we have now been able to extend the instant asset write off threshold to businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million dollars. That is just a great win for small and medium sized businesses across Australia. But Prime Minister, we announced it on Tuesday night and I'm just delighted that it went through the Senate last night. So to all those businesses out there, go out there and do what we need you to do - invest back into your business, prosper, grow and create more jobs for Australians.

But Prime Minister, we're here today obviously at Vogue Constructions with James Service and this is what we are all about as a Government. People who are out there having a go, they deserve a government that backs them every step of the way. And what we know is that Australians, they need the skills for the jobs of today and for tomorrow. And that is why we have made in excess of a half a billion dollar announcement in skilling Australians in our Budget. And as part of that announcement, we are going to create up to 80,000 new apprentices. And Prime Minister, we've met a number of those fantastic apprentices here today. We want to see more tradies on the job and we're doing that by creating a new incentive payment for both employers and the apprentice themselves in areas of identified skilled needs. So potentially plasterers, plumbers, and carpenters, many of whom we've met here today. The payment is on top of the other incentives that you can already receive. It is $4,000 for the employer and $2,000 for the apprentice themselves.

We are all about backing Australians as a Government, who are out there having a go. Whether it's ensuring that our small and family businesses have the economic framework they need to prosper and grow and create more jobs for Australians, but also ensuring that we're investing in our Australians so that our employers have the employees with the skills that they need.

Thanks Michaelia. And Jim, it’s great to be back here in Googong with you and projects like this are actually good for vets.

SENATOR JIM MOLAN AO, DSC: They certainly are, Prime Minister, and Fiona and I live in this area and we're very, very confident that the kind of quality of the houses that you're seeing being built here is of an extraordinary high standard. My daughter and her husband, who moved down a couple of years ago from Darwin in the military, moved to a Defence Housing Authority house down here and the DHA houses here are of an extraordinary standard. And as someone who's lived in houses of a lesser standard over the last 40 years Prime Minister, we've seen a few here. But we're very lucky in this electorate here and we're very lucky in the top part of Eden-Monaro in that we've got the big defence headquarters out at Bungendore. We've got defence headquarters in Canberra. This is a great suburb for people who work in defence to live here and work out there. But Prime Minister, the thing that strikes me is as an ex-military person is the contribution that our Government's making towards infrastructure across Australia at $100 billion in the next few years we're putting in. That has not just a rubber hits the road effect here, it has a strategic effect and that’s important to all of us.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks a lot Jim. Well, happy to take some questions obviously on the skills package, on the small business and the legislation passing the Senate last night, but obviously happy to take any other questions.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on the income tax cuts Bill Shorten is expected to announce he's going to further the $350 rebate to anyone who earns under $40,000. What's your view on that?

PRIME MINISTER: What you won't hear from Bill Shorten tonight is the $200 billion of higher taxes he's going to put on the Australian economy. But you'll hear a lot of lies and what Australians, I think, will become more and more familiar with as we go towards the next election is all you'll hear ultimately from the Labor Party is lies and taxes. That's what Bill Shorten's about - telling lies about what the Government has done, and funding anything he talks about with higher taxes. That's what the Labor Party stands for - lies and higher taxes. And that's why people don't trust Labor when it comes to managing money. And I think it's why after five and a half years people have concluded about Bill Shorten he's not someone who can be trusted with the economy. He’s frankly not someone who can be really trusted at all. He's had five and a half years to prove otherwise. And people rightly have their very strong reservations about him and they’ll make that judgment between now and the next election ultimately. But what Labor about are just lies and taxes.

JOURNALIST: We're talking about jobs, in Sydney 200 people have just being put off work at a Huggies factory and the company is blaming the high price of energy. Is that disappointing to you? You've had six years to sort it out.

PRIME MINISTER: In New South Wales the unemployment rate is 3.9  per cent. And that's the lowest rate of unemployment we've ever seen in New South Wales. Our Government over the course of the last five and a half years 1.2 million jobs have been created and we're seeing tens of thousands of jobs being created every month. And the great opportunity for Australians is our economy continues to change and shift, then people are able to find those jobs. In fact, we need more people in jobs. And that's one of the great challenges that we face going forward with a $100 billion infrastructure program that is fuelling the economy. Whether it's here in New South Wales or anywhere else around the country and in a big city like Sydney, what we see is that people are able to weather the disappointment and the impact I know that this can have on individuals when there are changes in these businesses.

The great positive on the other side is though a strong economy that continues to provide new employment opportunities for Australians of all ages. It hasn't just been record employment growth for people aged between 15 and 24. It's been record growth for people aged over 55 as well. The benefit of a strong economy is when there are jobs and when there are disappointments and when there are changes, that there is the confidence that the opportunities will be there into the future and that you'll be able to go forward as a family and have that greater confidence in a stronger economy. You put $200 billion of higher taxes... now, tonight Bill Shorten needs to explain and he needs to list every single one of those taxes. His higher income taxes, his higher taxes on businesses and small businesses through the trust system, his higher taxes on superannuation contribution, his higher taxes on housing. Housing tax alone, by abolishing negative gearing as we know it and putting up capital gains tax on investments just like the one we're standing here right now will have a devastating effect on the housing and construction industry, costing tens of thousands of jobs. Master Builders have made that point themselves. And those taxes combined with the most ruthless of all and that is the $5 billion a year tax on retirees. People who have paid taxes all their lives, have planned for their retirement. And Bill Shorten because he can't manage his own budget is going to put his hands in the budget of self-funded retirees and retirees more generally.

This is the problem with Labor. When they can't manage their own money - which is all the time - they always come after yours. That is their record in government. Our record is completely different. We have legislated tax cuts. That's our record. Tax cuts for personal income tax. Tax cuts for small and family businesses. And we've done that while being opposed by the Labor Party. The Labor Party opposes 94 per cent of Australians paying no more than 30 cents in their marginal tax rate. The Labor Party are opposed to that. They want all those Australians to pay more tax.

Our plan is for them to pay less tax. And we demonstrated that in last year's budget. The Labor Party opposed that and were forced to eventually support it. And what we've done is ensure that Australians both today and over the next decade will pay lower tax under the Liberal and Nationals.

JOURNALIST: Do you accept that the $1.6 billion underspend of the NDIS is because of the administration's maladministration?

PRIME MINISTER: No, what it is is a result of the estimated demand that we expected to be in by the 1st of July 2019, that mark won't be met until the 1st of July 2020. But the truth is this - this is what happens with the Budget. If there is additional demand and if there are improvements that can be made and that there is more demand that comes forward, then it will be met. It will be absolutely met. If these estimates are proved to be too conservative and the demand is greater for the NDIS, those bills will be fully met. So there is absolutely no obstacle whatsoever that if demand increases beyond the estimates that are in the Budget for disabilities, then those bills will be paid.

So there is absolutely not a cent being withheld from one program, one package. Every single package that is needed in the NDIS and every improvement that could be made in the NDIS to see more packages supported, every single dollar of that will come. There have been no changes to the amount that is being provided for these packages and I hope, I hope, that what we see as we go forward with further improvements that there will be greater demand. And where there is greater demand, every single cent will be delivered to supporting those increased packages.

JOURNALIST: But isn’t the issue not that it’s not not being spent, it's that families waiting up to six months...

PRIME MINISTER: And these are the improvements that need to be made. And this is what I said last night. And we need to ensure that we continue to make the improvements to the NDIS. I mean, in the Budget that we announced just the other night, there's $527.1 million dollars to undertake the Royal Commission into abuse of people with disabilities. Now, you remember the Labor Party thought that could be done for $26 million and that it didn't need to involve the states and territories. That shows you how half baked, how uncooked Labor's policy was when it came to addressing that issue. I mean, they only missed the cost of it by half a billion dollars. Now, when we do things we do them properly and that's why we have committed to that Royal Commission into the abuse of people with disabilities. And that's why we have committed to more than half a billion dollars in funds. And I'll have more to say about this in the next few days to ensure that that Royal Commission into the abuse of people with disabilities is done properly. And Labor never had a terms of reference, they never had any clue really about how to achieve this. And I think that is a further demonstration of the commitment of our Government to deal with the challenges that people facing living with and their families with disabilities how seriously we take that issue and I take the NDIS just as seriously. It's our Government that has ensured that the NDIS always can be fully funded into the future. And as we continue to improve this program, remember this is the biggest social program we have seen put together in this country since Medicare. Of course it's going to have its challenges and the demand is ramping up significantly. And as that demand continues to ramp up, every single package will be supported, every single cent will be delivered. And I've got to say I'm quite disappointed with the way that the Labor Party has sought to politicise this. The NDIS is supposed to be a bipartisan initiative. We certainly gave the NDIS support when we were in opposition and for Labor to misrepresent this and create unnecessary anxiety for people and families living with disabilities I think is quite appalling. I mean, we will need every element of the demand for these packages in the NDIS. They will all be fully funded and if demand is higher than what has been estimated in the Budget, those costs will be met, those invoices will be paid.

JOURNALIST: On an Indigenous voice into Parliament, there has been money allocated for this in the Budget. Will it be a referendum for that or will it be an advisory body?

PRIME MINISTER: We will continue to work through those issues with the Indigenous community. And we've said that in response to the Joint Select Committee report and this remains an important issue. But what remains even more important, to be honest, is the package we announced the other night for Australians, young Australians, in relation to youth mental health. Our plan, the biggest ever plan to combat youth suicide in this country. And youth suicide is reaching devastatingly into remote Indigenous communities. And that's why we've got a targeted plan to deal with remote Indigenous youth suicide in this country. You asked me what my number one priority is for Indigenous Australians? I want to do everything I can to ensure that young Indigenous Australians don't take their own lives. That's my priority for Indigenous Australians and I'm very certain that would be the priority of indigenous parents for their children. Thanks very much everyone.

DAVID KOCH: Prime Minister, good morning to you.

PRIME MINISTER: G’day.

KOCH: Plenty of sweeteners in the Budget for working Australians. Is it a bit too soon though? We’re still in budget deficit, $4 billion this year, $7 billion next year. Have you bought that relief forward too much?

PRIME MINISTER: No, because what this is about is entering Australians that keep more of what they earn. The reason we’re back into surplus, is yes, we’ve kept spending under control, yes we’ve kept taxes under control, but it has been about the hard work of Australians. They’ve been going out there and working hard and small businesses working hard. That’s why they also have tax relief with that instant tax write off up to $30,000, businesses up to $50 million, family businesses. That’s what has been driving our economy forward and the best way to deal with the difficulties ahead, is to ensure that our economy is strong and that Australians, whether they’re working for themselves or they’re working for others, that they’re getting the incentive and reward for their effort.

That’s how to make a stronger Australia.

KOCH: Okay tax is one side of it, but the other side is wage increases. Look, you’ve have had record jobs growth, no denying that. Unemployment is so low, but we're still not getting the pay rises are we? Is that going to change?

PRIME MINISTER: Well as the Reserve Bank Governor only said only this week, what we have seen is an improvement in real wages, but there’s still a long way to go and you're not going to get better wage increases without a stronger economy.

You’re not going to get better wage increases from an economy that is weighed down by higher taxes.

That’s why we are keeping taxes low. That’s why we’re supporting small and family businesses, so the economy can grow. We’re investing in the congestion-busting infrastructure that gets tradies out of the traffic jams and onto the site, where you can actually earn. You’re not going to have better wage growth in a weaker economy, where there would be $200 million in higher taxes from the alternative being put forward by Labor.

KOCH: See, these budget surpluses, which look impressive in the years going forward, just terrific, they’re all dependant on maintaining a strong economy. But the Treasurer even in his speech said we're facing really difficult economic conditions in the next few years, particularly from overseas. Do you think you can deliver those surpluses?

PRIME MINISTER: Well we can. I mean the last two Budgets were better - when I was standing here last year, we bettered what we said we were going to do by $10 billion. It was the same the previous year. So we have form on doing better than what we’ve outlined in the Budget, that’s what we have been able to achieve and I think that’s why Australians do trust us. You’re right, we're facing some difficult times ahead and now is not the time to hand the economic wheel over to others who don't have to drive. It’s to keep us going in the direction we're going, because the next decade, the decade we will all live in and our children will live in, the opportunities we’ll have and the businesses we’re responsible for, these are things that are going to be conditioned by the economy people live in. That’s why we need it as strong as possible.

You don't make an economy stronger by taxing it more or having reckless emissions targets which only put the price of everything up.

KOCH: Big infrastructure spending. What, $100 billion over the next few years? I’ve got to say, you must be a fan of Utopia, the TV series because you’re creating a National Fast Train Authority. It takes us back to that series. Big infrastructure in regional areas, which need the jobs growth?

PRIME MINISTER: That’s right, this infrastructure plan is all about two things. It’s about managing population growth for the future. So the Fast Rail to go from Melbourne to Geelong - and the other projects which we’re now examining - but that Melbourne to Geelong one we’ve put the $2 billion down for that and we’re going to get on with that project. That’s about our satellite cities, that’s about congestion-busting in our cities, dealing with pinch-points and chokepoints that are actually tying up our economy. We’ll make sure that people can get home sooner and safer, to spend time with their families.

Out in the regional areas it’s about linking the farm to the port and to the markets.

KOCH: Yep.

PRIME MINISTER: It’s about connecting our regional areas with our major centres. It’s also about making our roads safer. But the thing I love about investing in infrastructure is, it creates jobs. It creates jobs particularly in regional areas. I mean the money we’re putting into the Princes Highway down on the south coast of New South Wales, that’s not only going to make what is a notorious stretch of road - which I know very well – much, much safer, but it’s also going to support local jobs and the local economy as well. So Warren Mundine I know will be very pleased about that.

KOCH: So this is obviously a marketing document for the upcoming federal election, it’s dependent on you getting re-elected. You can almost say anything at the moment and then backtrack later if you are re- elected.

PRIME MINISTER: No, no. 

KOCH: Are you going to guarantee all these measures? We have heard fast train plans for the last 20 years and none of them have ever got up. Are you guaranteeing everything in this Budget if you get re-elected?

PRIME MINISTER: Absolutely. At the last Budget, I said we were going to do the Melbourne Airport Rail Link and we have signed the heads of agreement with the state government there in Victoria to achieve just that. We said we were going to start work on the Western Sydney Airport and we’ve not only done that, but it’s now called the Nancy Bird Walton Airport and we're getting on with that.

Our record David, is of delivering these things. What we promised at the last election and what we’re promising at this one will be that.

But I want to pick you up on one thing. What this is, is a plan to keep our economy strong over the next 10 years. It’s a plan to build our economy, to secure Australia's future. The economy being strong is what delivers what has already been a more than 60 per cent increases in hospitals spending, in school funding for state schools and public schools, already that’s what we have achieved. A 27 per cent increase in funding for Medicare. Medicare bulk billing is now at the highest level we have seen in this country, because of a strong economy and a Government that values Medicare.

I’ve got to say, the thing I'm most proud of in this Budget, David, is the $461 million we are putting in to combat youth suicide.

KOCH: Yep.

PRIME MINISTER: This is something all of us I think –

KOCH: Totally agree.

PRIME MINISTER:  One in four Australians struggle with mental health issues and for our young people, we’ve got to take this on. That’s what a strong economy and a surplus Budget does; it means we can take on these challenges, while funding drugs for leukaemia. That is what a strong economy is about.

KOCH: Couldn’t agree more with you on that point. Prime Minister you’ve got a very busy day ahead selling the Budget, appreciate you doing it live and first here on Sunrise, have a good day.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks a lot David.




DEBORAH KNIGHT: Scott Morrison joins me now. Good morning.

PRIME MINISTER: Hi Deb.

KNIGHT: I thought Tina Arena was your singer of choice and yet we’ve got ACDC Back in Black - not quite back in the black though, we're still back the red at the moment this year, aren’t we? 

PRIME MINISTER: No we’ll be back in the black in 2019/20, that’s what the Budget is, it’s 2019/20. I'm pleased that in the current year we’ve actually beat what I said the Budget would be last year by $10 billion. So we’re $10 billion better off than last year, just like we were last year.

We have form on actually bettering what we put in the Budget. That's what we put in for next year's Budget, we’ll be back in surplus for the first time in 12 years. It's been a long way back, from when we had a surplus under Peter Costello and John Howard. We had those Labor years where the surpluses turned into deficits. We've been able to turn it around over these last six years. We are now back in surplus, which means we can invest in things like tackling youth suicide, which is a great passion of my Government.

KNIGHT: Surpluses have been promised though and not delivered in the past. Labor's Wayne Swan failed to deliver four of them, very famously. Can you guarantee that this surplus will eventuate?

PRIME MINISTER: Absolutely, as I just said, in the last two budgets we bettered what we said we would do, by $10 billion each year.

Wayne Swan put a Budget together, that you’re talking about, that assumed an iron ore price at $175 US a tonne. I mean, he probably still thinks it's that price and it's not anything near that. So our forecasts, particularly when it comes to commodities, are very, very conservative. Always have been. That's why we have outperformed each year, on our Budget. That’s why we are further ahead than where a couple of years ago, we said we would be.

But a surplus is the first step, then you’ve got to pay down the debt. It took John Howard and Peter Costello decade to do that and we’ve set out a plan to do exactly the same thing. Paying down the debt and now using the surplus to invest in critical services. We have already increased hospitals and Medicare funding, 60 per cent more for hospitals, 27 per cent for Medicare, more than 60 per cent for state and public schools. That’s what we’ve already done, now I'm looking forward to investing more, to keep the economy strong and the services where Australians can rely on them.

KNIGHT: In the Budget though, last night the Treasurer did point out that there were headwinds the economy is facing - the slowdown in the global economy, the housing market is in a slump and forecasts of further house price falls to come?

PRIME MINISTER: True.

KNIGHT: Those are beyond your control, a lot of those factors, commodity prices too. So how can you guarantee a surplus when you can't control those factors?

PRIME MINISTER: Well our commodity price forecasts for example are well below, right now, what the price is. So we've been very conservative about those things, as we have in the past, which is why we have outperformed.

But the other thing I would say is, in facing those headwinds, you have to actually release the economy to perform. That's why we're getting taxes down. That’s why for small and family businesses, we’ve given them further tax relief in this Budget. That’s why we’re giving Australians, whether they’re on low and middle incomes, they’re getting that immediate relief. Millions and millions of Australians are benefiting from that right now and also, having a tax system over the next decade which means that most Australians will never see bracket creep in their life. Now I think that is a major change that gives Australians incentive for effort.

We want Australians out there having a go. This is a Budget which is a fair go for those who have a go. If Australians keep having a go like they have been under our Government, then we’re only going to get stronger. That’s how we can deal with the pressures ahead.

You cannot have higher wages by having higher taxes, that equation just doesn’t add up.

KNIGHT: Budgets are always political documents but this is especially so with the election looming, do you think that this will be enough to win votes?

PRIME MINISTER: This is a plan, an economic plan, that's what Budgets are. I’ve done quite a number of these and that’s what the Budget is, it’s your economic plan for how you’re going to see an economy over the next decade that’s going to be the economy Australians want to live in.

KNIGHT: But will it win votes though? Because you need those.

PRIME MINISTER: Well that's for Australian to decide, but what I believe they’re looking for is for unemployment to stay low, for investments in infrastructure and investment in services – as I said – already, 60 per cent increases in funding for hospitals and for schools. That will continue and even more so into the future. Why? Because we are driving a stronger economy, keeping taxes under control, keeping spending under control and investing the dividend of the hard work of Australians, back into the services they rely on.

A critical one of those is busting-congestion in our cities. Our population management plan, which I announced a few weeks ago, is about having sensible migration intake backed up by strong infrastructure investment, dealing with the little chokepoints all across the country, in our cities –

KNIGHT: A lot have been in marginal seats.

PRIME MINISTER: They’re right across the country, they’re in Labor seats, they’re in Liberal seats, they’re all across the country. Because a whole city functions better when you deal with these chokepoints in the city.

When I was Treasurer, I had the Productivity Commission look at this and they said cities have got to function better for Australia to be more productive. So I want an economy over the next ten years that has lower taxes and is more productive, not one that has higher taxes, which is what our opponents are suggesting. Because higher taxes slow growth, it means lower wages and higher unemployment.

KNIGHT: Is it wise though to be spending the extra money that we do have when there are those headwinds that are facing our economy? Should we be putting this surplus in the bank?

PRIME MINISTER: What we’re doing is allowing Australians to keep more of what they earn. I don’t consider tax relief to be spending a dollar. Tax relief is saying to a small business that is working hard; “You get to keep more of what you’ve earned.”

KNIGHT: Well it’s spending our dollars to give the dollars though.

PRIME MINISTER: No, it’s not. No, it's their money. Tax relief is people being able to keep their own money. I think that's a really important distinction.

The Labor Party thinks that tax relief is spending money. It's not. It's Australians keeping their own money. I want Australians to earn more in a stronger economy and I want them to keep more of what they earn in a stronger economy. So they have the incentive to keep doing what they’ve been doing - making Australia stronger, making our economy stronger and I want to keep that incentive there for them. So, if you’re going out to work today, good on you, you're building a stronger country.

KNIGHT: The tax cuts you’ve announced equate to about $19 a week extra for the average Australian income. Do you think that will be enough to sway voters, do you think that amount of money in the pocket will be enough to make people think that’s a good policy?

PRIME MINISTER: This is the biggest tax relief we have seen since the Howard Government. For a middle income family, that's more than $2,000 a year. I mean, that's a power bill for the entire year on average in Sydney for example, for many families. So this does provide that relief.

But it does more than that Deb; what it does is say; “If you do better, you'll keep more of it.” That's the incentive. You cannot run a stronger economy where people have no incentive to actually go out there and work hard, take risks, run businesses and put the investment in. That’s what creates a stronger economy. We’ve got more than half a billion dollars in this Budget which is focused on skilling u’ Australians, not just those who are coming out of school, but for people leaving a job when they’re 55. People need skills across their whole lives and they need to be able to adapt and change and there’s more than half a billion dollars we’ve put into that very task here in Australia.

KNIGHT: To get that tax cut though, they will have to vote for you in the election because it won’t be introduced into Parliament this week, will it?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it won't make a difference whether it’s introduced this week or not. What Labor did last year –

KNIGHT: Well the election is looming, so?

PRIME MINISTER: But the Tax Office – if the Labor Party says they support our tax cuts, then the Tax Office can administer it on that basis. Last year, when I put a full tax plan into the Budget, Labor tried to play games with it, break it up and try to strip it away. Because you see, Labor's plan is to tax some people more, to pretend they’re helping other people. That's not how we do things. We think all Australians who work hard deserve tax relief. The Labor Party wants to punish some and engage in this class envy, which has no place in Australia. I think all Australians want to see all Australians do better. They don't think some people have to do worse, for them to do better.

KNIGHT: Will you be visiting the Governor-General this weekend to call the election?

PRIME MINISTER: There’s three dates for the election, the 11th, 18th or 25th, they're the options we have.

KNIGHT: Have you decided? 

PRIME MINISTER: When I decide to go out to the Governor-General, the people will see that car drive to Yarralumla.

KNIGHT: Have you made a decision yet on the date though?

PRIME MINISTER: No not yet.

KNIGHT: Not yet?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

KNIGHT: And what are the factors you’re considering?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, they’re matters for a Prime Minister to determine.

KNIGHT: Mother's Day is on May 12th.

PRIME MINISTER: Yes it is.

KNIGHT: So will you and the girls be delivering Jenny breakfast in bed, or will you perhaps be too busy on the campaign trial?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, we’ll all be together, I can assure you of that.

KNIGHT: I’m trying! I'm trying to get the date out of you.

[Laughter]

Of course ultimately voters will be judging you on performance, that’s the ultimate guide.

PRIME MINISTER: Absolutely, as they should.

KNIGHT: If you've been a good government though, how do you respond when people say why have you needed three Prime Ministers?

PRIME MINISTER: The real choice is who is going to be the Prime Minister after the next election. My Party changed its rules, so if at this election the Liberal Party and National Party are returned, then I will be returned as the Prime Minister and I will serve as Prime Minister over the next parliamentary term. That's what  our rule changes in the Liberal Party say. So the real choice is at the next election, do you want Bill Shorten and the Labor Party or do you want myself and the Liberal and National Parties? And our record is one that has brought the Budget back into balance for the first time in 12 years.

The last time Australians voted Labor and switched to the Labor Party, they’ve paid for it for the last decade and more. You vote Labor once, you pay for it for a decade. Now is not the time to hand over the economic wheel to a party that doesn't know how to drive.

KNIGHT: Alright, and Sunday? Should I put a mark around Sunday and expect to be on air announcing an election?

PRIME MINISTER: I’m sure you’ll always be on air, I’m sure your viewers will be demanding that you be on air all the time.

[Laughter]

KNIGHT: Prime Minister, we thank you for your time this week.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks Deb.




FRAN KELLY: Prime Minister thank you very much for joining us.

PRIME MINISTER: Good morning Fran.

KELLY: It's taken twelve long years to get the Budget back into surplus. That's due next year. Now that you say you've done it, you want to hand out another $158 billion in tax cuts. How is that strong and prudent budget management, given the signs of an economic slowdown ahead?

PRIME MINISTER: I don't want to hand out anything. I just want people to keep more of what they earn Fran, that's what tax relief is. This is people's own money. This isn't spending, this is money that they've earned. We believe that the path to keeping our economy strong, which has been so responsible for the budget surplus that was delivered last night, the way you keep doing that is, you keep giving Australians the incentive to keep going out there and doing what they do every day, making our economy stronger by working hard, running their businesses and doing what they do best. You've got to give them the opportunity to keep doing that. I mean, otherwise why would they work harder under a Labor Government that just wants to increase their taxes? Under our Government they’ll have the incentive to keep doing exactly what they're doing. That's what makes our economy strong.

KELLY: But is $158 billion of promised tax cuts on top of $144 billion already legislated, this Budget tells us there are danger signs ahead for the economy. The global outlook is slow, the growth forecasts have been cut, employment growth has been downgraded, consumption growth is slowing too. How can such a lacklustre economy pay for or start paying for more than $300 billion dollars of tax relief?

PRIME MINISTER: Well again Fran you’re seeing it as expenditure. We don't see it as that, we see it as an investment in Australians to keep our economy growing. You don't make -

KELLY: Yeah but you’re also saying you're going to stay in surplus.

PRIME MINISTER: And we are going to stay in surplus over that entire period. We will pay the debt down to zero, just like John Howard and Peter Costello did, which is what the Budget set out last night. But you don't make your economy stronger and more resilient to face the very challenges you're talking about, by increasing taxes. I mean, $200 billion -

KELLY: No, but you don't get to surpluses and maintain them with slowing growth and slowing global outlook and tax handouts, do you?

PRIME MINISTER: That’s already taken to account in the Budget. That's why the Treasurer was able to say last night that we achieved these surpluses while maintaining the discipline of keeping our taxes below the speed limit of 23.9 per cent.

See, the way we've been able to get the Budget back into surplus, is by having the right responsibility, of balance, by keeping taxes under control, keeping spending under control. That's why we've seen people go from receiving welfare payments, to receiving wages, going from welfare into work in record numbers. That's how the Budget balances and stays in a surplus. You keep your economy strong by backing the Australians who make it strong.

KELLY: Okay well speaking wages, Bill Shorten has declared the election will be a referendum on wages. Wages are forecast in your Budget to grow 2.75 per cent next year, 3.25 in 2020/21, but the same Budget papers show employment growth slowing next financial year and beyond and unemployment stuck at 5 per cent. If there's no tightening of the labour market going on and growth forecasts are downgraded what is going to push up wages?

PRIME MINISTER: Well our forecasts are always conservative. As you know unemployment is now at 4.9 per cent, which is better than -

KELLY: Well, they’re not always conservative, we haven't hit the wages forecasts for the last five budgets.

PRIME MINISTER: And what we have achieved are $10 billion and better improvements on the Budget bottom line in the last two Budgets we delivered, Fran. So we've been overachieving on what we've put in the Budgets for years now. That's why we've been able to come back and get the Budget in surplus. But you know what, the important -

KELLY: Yeah, but where is the wages growth going to come from?

PRIME MINISTER: I'll tell you. The wages growth is going to come from businesses continuing to expand, more people accessing more markets investing in their businesses, because of the low tax environment we're creating for them.

KELLY: But you’ve got unemployment growth slowing in this Budget.

PRIME MINISTER: Employment growth continues because we've got unemployment down to the lowest level in the last decade, Fran. So we're going to get more people in jobs, 80,000 more apprentices we're going to train. This is what the Budget is driving; continued growth in our economy. That's where you get wage increases from. You won't get wage increases from a reckless emissions target of 45 per cent, which is going to force those same businesses that people want wage rises from, to spend $36 billion paying for carbon credits from companies from countries overseas.

KELLY: Let's come back to your Budget, let's come back to your tax package. The most immediate measure - a lot of moving parts in this tax package - the most immediate measure is the proposed doubling of the low and middle income tax offset, which is worth up $1,080 for every single Australian and double that for dual income families.

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

KELLY: Four and a half million taxpayers would receive that tax cut from the 1st of July. But you're essentially matching, a little bit more, the promise Labor has have on the table for a year. That makes it a net neutral at the ballot box in May, doesn’t it?

PRIME MINISTER: No. This is the big lie of what Labor's been saying about their tax plan. Labor's tax plan is about taxing some people more, to pretend they're providing relief to others. We're providing tax relief right across the board, Fran.

KELLY: In the short term, in the first four years, you’re providing tax relief for the same group Labor is.

PRIME MINISTER: No, no there’s tax relief going right across the board. Now, that tax relief is designed to encourage Australians to go out there and keep doing what they're doing. You know, you’ve got people at the moment, they're on their way to the trams and they're on their way to the trains and the ferries and I want to give them the incentive every single day - regardless of where they sit in the labour force, regardless of what job they have or what their income is - I want them to keep going out there and doing the right thing for their families, which they want to do.

KELLY: Yeah and in a real comparison over the forward estimates, over the next three to four years, middle income and low income Australians would get the same immediate tax hit from you as they would from Labor.

PRIME MINISTER: No, because we're not going to put on 45 per cent reckless emissions target, which is going to put a further tax on the economy.

KELLY: Well that’s not about your tax cuts.

PRIME MINISTER: We're not going to put a $5 billion retiree tax on Australians. We're not going to increase taxes for half the population, this is what Labor plans to do, Fran.

KELLY: Okay, okay.

PRIME MINISTER: They have $200 billion dollars and more, plus the reckless emissions target, which will put up the costs of absolutely everything and cost wages by independent analysis of $9,000. That’s what Labor's plan is. Our plan is lower taxes and people keeping more of what they earn. But importantly, investing back in the services. I mean, hospital funding Fran, has increased by 63 per cent under our Government just till now. Medicare is up 27 per cent and schools funding is up -

KELLY: I want to talk about your Budget.

PRIME MINISTER: That is my Budget.

KELLY: I want to talk about your tax plan.

PRIME MINISTER: I’m talking about schools, hospitals and Medicare, Fran, and it’s all gone up.

KELLY: Yeah, but most of the money in your Budget is going on this tax plan. You'd be happy to hear last night, I think, that Labor would support this initial part of your tax plan, the $1080 for individuals. They've said so already. There's only two sitting days left before the election, why not legislate that tax relief today to give taxpayers certainty ahead of the 1st of July if it's so urgent to people and their cost of living, why not take the trouble to get it through both Houses today?

PRIME MINISTER: Because Fran I'm going to put this Budget to the Australian people. Labor played this game last year and they tried to split our tax plan in the Parliament and played games to try and put up taxes for other people, while pretending to help others.

I’m going to let the Australian people decide on this. This will go to an election and it means that the Tax Office... if the Labor Party, if people think they can trust the Labor Party to reduce their taxes, well, their form goes completely against that.

People know they can trust us to deliver tax reform, because that's exactly what we have been doing now for five and a half years. The Tax Office - if the Labor Party says that they support the lower end tax cuts, well the Tax Office is able to go and administer the Tax Act on that basis. So the legislative issue is a moot one, what really matters, Fran, is would you trust Labor to actually cut your taxes? When their real plan is to increase taxes by $200 billion on the Australian economy.

That's why Treasurer said so many times last night; “We're increasing funding for hospitals, schools, Medicare and we're doing it without increasing taxes.”

KELLY: He did said a lot of times, eight times in fact in that speech. Prime Minister you’re essentially though, to put it bluntly, weaponising this $1,080 dollar tax cut to help you win the election, aren’t you? Haven’t low and middle income earners become hostage to the election campaign?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't believe so at all Fran, I think I just outlined it perfectly well. If the Labor Party supports the tax cuts, well, they have to do is say so and the Tax Office can administer it on that basis.

But I don't think Australians will trust them to do that, Fran and I don't trust them to do that because their form is to put up tax. You see, we have a tax discipline in our Budget which says that we have a speed limit on how much you can tax the economy. The Labor Party is going to abolish that and that's going to mean tens of billions of dollars of higher taxes weighing down our economy, slowing growth which slows wages. It puts people out of work.

Now, I want the next decade to be a strong one. You said at the start of the interview, it's taken us 12 years to get back to where John Howard left us and Peter Costello. Last time people changed the government and voted Labor, they've been paying for it for a decade.

You vote Labor once you'll pay for it for a decade. That's what last night's Budget demonstrated.

KELLY: Prime Minister I know your time is tight this morning and you must go, so one final question. Last time people voted for the Coalition too they voted for a different prime minister. They've ended up with you. You want people to judge you on your economic record. Your mantra is; “Who do you trust?” But why would the Government's economic record, a Budget back in black, why would that be at the forefront of their minds when they enter the ballot box? Why won't they be thinking of all the division and the disunity at the heart of the Coalition Government which has thrown up three prime ministers in four years?

PRIME MINISTER: Because that is our economic record, Fran. It's our economic record and the strength of the economy that matters to Australians going about their business today. The choice about who the leader will be, will be between Bill Shorten and I, for the country at the next election.

KELLY: Well, that's what they thought last time and then didn't turn out that way at the end of the term.

PRIME MINISTER: And the Liberal Party has changed their rules to ensure that successful at this election, then if you vote Liberal at this election, you get me as Prime Minister. If you vote Labor at this election, then you get Bill Shorten as prime minister. That's the choice that is before the Australian people. Our Party changed its’ rules, the Labor Party changed its rules many years ago. What that means is, at this election, if you vote Liberal, then I will be your Prime Minister for the next three years. What that means is the record investments in hospitals and schools. I've got to say, of all the measures in the Budget that we announced last night, Fran - and I'm sure you'd agree -  it’s the $461 million we're putting to combat youth suicide and youth mental health challenges. I don't know of a family in this country that in some way, through a friend or God forbid directly in their own family's experience, that haven’t been touched by youth suicide.

That's what a surplus does. That's what a strong economy does. That's the thing I'm most proud of in this Budget; that we are going to take on the challenge and combat youth suicide in this country. Because it's taking far too many of our young lives.

KELLY: Prime Minister thank you very much for joining us.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks a lot Fran.




ALAN JONES: Prime Minister good morning.

PRIME MINISTER: Good morning Alan.

JONES: I don't want to take any air out of your tires but can I tell you that the switchboard and emails have been on fire here, not about the Budget, but about Mr Shorten's energy policy.

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

JONES: I've said, this is a bigger economic statement that anything you said last night, because people are genuinely frightened. I’ll just read a couple; David said to me, “Please pass on our thanks to Bill Shorten. Up until now we thought there wasn't a choice in the election and the Libs would be heading to the door. Then Bill highlighted that the choice wasn't so simple when he started elaborating on his policy.” They go on and on with this sort of stuff, electricity bills. Now, just before I get you to comment here, I was just taking some figures out. I mean this is supposed to be the Labor Party, the party of the battler, the party of struggle street. Their car policy says otherwise. Mitsubishi's electric car would cost $49,000, Holden $60,000, Nissan $60,000, Tesla's $50,000. Many of them take more than eight hours for a standing charge. Then the argument is; “Oh well,” Bill Shorten says, “we can sustain an electric car and manufacturing industry”. Tony Shepherd, whom you know is one of Australia’s leading businessmen, says this is rubbish. He said we don't make any cars in Australia anymore, our manufacturing costs are very high, our cost of energy is nearly the highest in the Western world. The manufacture of any automobile, regardless of its engine, requires significant energy. It won't happen.

Now what are you saying to people? This is an economic suicide note.

PRIME MINISTER: Well it is Alan. I couldn't agree with you more on this, I mean frankly, they want to tell you what car to drive? This will put up the price of everything, it comes down to that. It's going to cost wages at least $9,000 a year. So you know, whatever you’re driving, Bill Shorten doesn't think you should be. It’s about 0.2 per cent of the car market today and he thinks he's going to take it to 50 per cent in ten years. But can I tell you another part of that plan which I find particularly troubling? This plan that he has to force companies to buy carbon credits from overseas.

JONES: Yep.

PRIME MINISTER: $36 billion will leave the country to go over and get carbon credits from Kazakhstan or wherever else they think they're going to get them from. That is money that is taken out of these companies that they would use to invest in their business, to employ people or increase their wages. I mean, it’s a reckless policy that threatens jobs, drives down people's earnings and at the most insidious level, it starts telling Australians how they need to live.

I mean, in our Budget last night Alan, we removed the luxury car tax on the Land Cruisers that farmers and people use in rural and regional areas and tourism operators. Bill Shorten says; “No, you can't buy those cars”. We’re going to actually make them more affordable for people who are doing it really tough as you know out in rural and regional Australia. We're getting rid of that tax and giving them the options and choices, through lower taxes more broadly, to get on and make the country as strong as it can be. Bill Shorten is going to tax the economy into non-existence.

JONES: Well coming back to the energy - because as I’ve said I actually sent a message to Josh Frydenberg, I said look, congratulations and so on, but I'm sorry, you haven't released the most important economic document this week. This was Labor's energy policy.

PRIME MINISTER: He did.

JONES: Yeah, no doubt about that. This is dangerous stuff now.

You just take a liquid natural gas exporter and they say we're now going to have to pay for a carbon tax in Australia, but our rivals, Qatar and Malaysia or Nigeria, suffer no similar costs. What is going to be the loss to our economy of that export industry?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, it's going to be about a half a trillion dollars overall, we believe, as a result of what Bill Shorten wants.

JONES:  You’re getting this costed, aren’t you?

PRIME MINISTER: We have and that BAE economic study that you’re familiar with, which I know you you’ve spoken to, their estimated cost of what Bill Shorten is talking about with his reckless carbon tax, carbon target - call it whatever you like, all I know is it’s going to increase the price of everything - that is going to cost the economy around half a trillion dollars. Now that's you know that's just under $500 billion or ‘five thousand million dollars’ as you would say. That's what it is. This is a huge dead weight on the Australian economy and he goes around talking about how he wants to increase wages and all this. You can't run a stronger economy, with higher wages, if you put this mountain of burden on the Australian people.

JONES: You’re dead right. Dead right.

PRIME MINISTER: There is a reason we're going into a surplus Budget next year is because of the hard work of Australians. Sure, our Government has done the right thing getting expenditure under control, taxes under control, investing in things that drive the economy. But the thing that really is behind the numbers that we saw last night, is the hard work of Australians running businesses, running farms in drought.

JONES: I’m sorry to turn you around here, thank you for that point. The businesses, okay. So we're talking about what used to be the Labor Party constituency - although John Howard brought them into the Liberal tent - but the tradesman.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah.

JONES: Now, how the hell does he manage? There’s no electric ute on the market.

PRIME MINISTER: No.

JONES: So what does this poor coot do when he uses a utility? Either he reduces his earnings and cops it, or alternately he puts someone off, or he jacks up the price of his product. I mean, this is a nightmare for these people.

PRIME MINISTER: That is all true. And by contrast what do we say? We're saying that the instant asset write off goes from $25,000 to $30,000.

JONES: Yep.

PRIME MINISTER: That it goes to businesses up to $50 million, that we’re going to spend over half a billion dollars training among that new apprentices, 80,000 new apprentices. So that tradie not only has a cheaper car, is paying a lesser cost for what he has to put in the tank, but on top of that he's able to get apprentices with additional incentives that helps him or her pass on their skills to another generation and we can keep building Australia and keep building our economy.

JONES: I just want to come back to this point, because I know you live in the undiluted luxury of Cronulla, or else Kirribilli. But there are people who actually live in areas of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and whatever, where they have no off-street parking facilities, they park on the street.

PRIME MINISTER: True, yep. 

JONES: Now again, Bill Shorten is saying that all these roads, new roads, new houses, new office developments, will have to have charging facilities. Now if this is the case –

PRIME MINISTER: The cost.

JONES: That’s right! The cost of your car goes up, your house goes up, your office goes up and the cost of the road goes up. Where is this being costed? I mean, are you going to prosecute this?

PRIME MINISTER: Well there's no doubt we're going to prosecute it. One of the ones that we haven't talked about yet, is what they’re going to say to farmers.

JONES: That’s it.

PRIME MINISTER: They're going to tell farmers, pastoralists and graziers what they can do on their land. Now, you know about this up in Queensland, those dreadful native veg laws that the Labor Government put in place up there.

JONES: Yes, I do.

PRIME MINISTER: You know, it's bad enough that you've got to deal with droughts and floods.

JONES: That’s it, good on you.

PRIME MINISTER: You’ve also got to deal with this numpty legislation, which basically tells farmers what they can do on their own land. Now, Bill Shorten wants to take that really bad idea and take it to the entire country. That is an insult to those who work on our land, particularly when they're going through some of the hardest conditions that any of them can remember.

By contrast what are we doing? We’ve got $6.3 billion dollars going in to support farmers in rural and regional communities that are drought-affected. Over $3 billion we're putting in for those hit by national disasters. You know what we're doing up in North Queensland, Alan, I know you keep in touch with what we're doing up there. Shane Stone is up there implementing that plan, we're rebuilding North Queensland fence by fence and beast by beast.

JONES: Right, just a couple of things here because there is thousands of pages this stuff. Just amplify for our listeners, 94 - of course you've got to get through an election to enable any of this to happen - but 94 per cent of Australians - you’ve got to say this slowly - will pay no more than 30 cents in the dollar of course, if they re-elect you people. Just amplify that point simply.

PRIME MINISTER: This is so important and we're changing when you set the threshold as well. So that means that the highest marginal tax rate that 94 per cent of Australians will pay, is just 30 cents in the dollar. Now, it’s  currently 32.5 on the plan that we got legislated after last year's Budget.

For the Labor Party, that would be 37 cents. So this is giving people the incentive to work hard. Alan, I don't know what the point of working hard would be under a Labor government, because the harder you work, the more they tax you.

JONES: Well, $200 billion of tax, I mean -

PRIME MINISTER: Exactly, $200 billion including the $5 billion on retirees. The most insulting thing I've heard - and they said it again yesterday in the Chamber when they were jeering at me - I said that these are Australians who are going to have to pay this retiree's tax under Labor who paid tax all of their lives. And they yelled out “They’re not paying tax”. That's what they think of those retirees! They’ve paid tax their whole lives.

JONES: Don’t forget death duties, don’t forget death duties. Does anyone sort of save and invest in whatever, to have the government take it? Julian Burnside, the glamour candidate down there in Kooyong, says death duties, the CFMEU say death duties, the Labor unions say death duties. For God's sake.

PRIME MINISTER: It’s savage. What Julian Burnside and the Greens say, it’s absolutely savage.

JONES: Now look, just a couple of things. I trust you're on top of all of this, I'm not suggesting you're not, but a couple of things that were important to our listeners here last night which won't be talked about today. I do want to thank you and Greg Hunt, who does a colossal job in the field of health. These two cancer drugs which are going to save patients up to $150,000 a year. Now are you across the detail, you’re going to you're going to add this Bavencio go to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It’s used to treat a rare but highly aggressive cancer, so good on you.

PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I met with two sufferers, and they were in remission, on Monday. They have had access to that drug. One of them had it on a clinical trial and the other one was able to afford it.

JONES: Good on you, so $40 a script now?

PRIME MINISTER: $6.50 for a concession card holder. There was also a lifesaving leukaemia drug we put on the PBS last night. More than 2,000 drugs we’ve put on the PBS, for lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer.

JONES: On breast cancer I just want to raise for our listeners. That’s Ibrance which they've been writing to me about, it’s used to treat inoperable breast cancer. Patients currently pay $55,000, now under the PBS it is $40 for a script and $6 for a concession.

PRIME MINISTER: That's right. As all cancer sufferers tell you when you talk to them, they also want to see more money going to research and treatment facilities. We have got $100 million going into the cancer treatment centre in Sydney and there's $80 million going down into that marvellous Peter Mac Centre down there in Melbourne. We are investing record levels in cancer research, backing in people like Glenn McGrath and the work that he does with breast cancer nurses, we announced that funding at the start of this year.

But the lesser known cancers - I'm so pleased you mentioned that – on skin cancer, that's only going to support of a few hundred people, but they're Australians and every single Australian life, every single Australian life matters.

JONES: That’s Bavencio. Well now I'll let you go because you've now got to talk about the most important economic statement of the week; the Shorten energy statement and I hope you'll prosecute that on behalf of everybody out there. I can tell you Prime Minister, in the emails and in the messages that are coming, that is all they are talking about.

PRIME MINISTER: I will Alan. Can I just mentioned one last this thing that I'm most pleased about in this Budget; that's the $461 million we're putting into combat youth suicide and mental health challenges in this country. There's not, I think, a family, a community in this country, that hasn't been touched by this, particularly in rural and regional areas, in remote Indigenous communities, in the suburbs of Sydney. This is this is something that breaks the nation's heart and last night, because of a strong economy, because we've got the Budget back into surplus next year, that means we can have the biggest fight against youth suicide this country's ever seen. I know all Australians are going to back us in on that.

JONES: Good on you, well done and thank you for your time Prime Minister.




TOM ELLIOTT: The Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Mr Morrison Good afternoon.

PRIME MINISTER: Hey Tom.

ELLIOTT: I watched Josh Frydenberg’s first Budget last night, is it going to win you the next election?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it’s about it being a plan to actually grow the Australian economy and bring us into surplus and invest in the essential services Australians rely on. The answer to your question is in the hands of the Australian people and the plan we once again put to them last night, I think demonstrates that you run a strong economy, you bring the Budget back into surplus and it means he can guarantee the funding like hospitals and schools that they rely on. I mean, we've already increased funding for both of those by more than 60 per cent over the last five and a half years and we want to keep that going.

ELLIOTT: But do you think the surplus matters in itself to everyday Australians? Because that was the most conspicuous thing in Josh Frydenberg speech last night, the surplus, the surplus, we’re back in black, we've got a surplus. Do you think your average person really cares?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, that wasn't just what Josh said last night, that's certainly where he started because getting the Budget back into balance means Australia is paying its way. It means now we can pay down the debt and it means that there’s around $18 billion dollars in interest payments that goes on the debt and you've got to get rid of that, so you can invest more in things like hospitals and schools.

Now last night we announced the $461 million dollar plan to combat youth suicide and youth mental health issues. You can do that when you've actually got the Budget back into balance. You can provide tax relief like we did last night, when you get the Budget back into balance. That's why - I mean a surplus of itself, it’s a means to an end. It's a means to the end of reducing debt and putting funding into the things that really matter to people.

ELLIOTT: Okay so will the ends, you know, the various spending programmes you outlined or Josh Frydenberg outlined, will they win you the election?

PRIME MINISTER: Well again Tom, that's for the Australian people to determine, I'm not complacent about this. What my job as Prime Minister is and the job of our team is to put forward our plans for how we're going to keep the economy growing and keep the Budget in balance. How we’re going to keep investing in the things that actually make a difference to people's lives and in Victoria, one of the biggest issues as you know - your callers call about it all the time and when I'm there this is the issue that is constantly raised - that's managing population growth.

So whether it's widening Racecourse Road out there in Flemington or Napoleon Road in Ferntree Gully with $50 million, all of these projects make the big difference so people get home sooner and safer. The money we've put into extending again, the funding for preschool education for 4 year olds, that makes a huge difference.

ELLIOTT: I was recently wandering around the seat of Kooyong. I don't live there but my daughter goes to school there and I noticed most of the candidates who are running against Josh Frydenberg seemed to be running on environmental platforms, Julian Burnside, Oliver Yates. Should you have done more on climate change to make sure you don't lose seats like Kooyong?

PRIME MINISTER: We’ve got $3.5 billion dollars worth of initiatives we announced in the Budget last night, because we're meeting our targets for 2030, 26 per cent, we're meeting them. I've set out very clearly how every single tonne of that is going to be achieved. Our position is based on you can have your economy and you can have your cleaner environment, you don't have to sell one out for the other. Now Julian Burnside can make all the points he wants, but I mean I don't think I've seen quite a bigger level of hypocrisy being exploited onto the Australian people I'd say. I’d say his hypocrisy is absolutely savage. 

ELLIOTT: Is it true that you will go to the Governor-General tomorrow and ask that Parliament be dissolved and an election be called?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

ELLIOTT: No, as in it's definitely not true?

PRIME MINISTER: No, the election will be called in April and it'll be held in May. I made it really clear last year when I said the Budget would be on the 2nd of April that the lead in and all the normal things would be allowed to take place and the Leader of the Opposition gets their reply.

ELLIOTT: But it is April now.

PRIME MINISTER: I know, but I also said that the Leader of the Opposition would be able give their reply. When the election is called, well that will be done in April and it'll be held in May.

ELLIOTT: Which date in May? 

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I'm not saying at this point, because when I've made that final decision, when I go out to see the Governor-General, that's when that will be public.

ELLIOTT: All right, we'll look forward to that. Now, the energy Newstart policy, I happened to watch Q&A accidentally on Monday night and I saw that Arthur Sinodinos was tackled on why the $75 to $125 energy subsidy wasn't going to people in receipt of Newstart. It looks as though you've backflipped on that. Is that true?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I wanted to see the payment passed through the Parliament and the Labor Party and others, you know, we were aware of the position and I wanted to see passed. I think we were in a position to be able to accommodate that and so it became part of the Government's bill. The reason we could do it is because our position in this current financial year was much stronger as a result of the way we've been managing things.

I mean, the difference between the Budget I handed down in May of last year for the current year we're in and where it's going to end up now, is better than $10 billion dollars. So we're in a position to share that improvement back with people who need it and we took the decision to extend that further in 2018/19, I don't have a problem that.

ELLIOTT: No, no, but it was only a week ago that the energy subsidy was announced and it looks like…

PRIME MINISTER: Well, it was on Sunday.

ELLIOTT: Well exactly, so it was a mistake that Newstart recipients missed out?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I wanted to see it passed through the Parliament and that's what you have to do to be pragmatic.

ELLIOTT: I see, so you made the change so it would be passed through Parliament?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

ELLIOTT: OK, very fast trains.

PRIME MINISTER: Better than very slow trains, Tom.

ELLIOTT: Well that's true, if they’re a reality.

PRIME MINISTER: Well that's a very good point.

ELLIOTT: So, I mean, I spoke at a Budget breakfast this morning and I mentioned I'd seen a picture of Malcolm and Tammy Fraser in 1978 getting on board a Japanese bullet train and saying, “This is what we need for Australia.” That was over 40 years ago now. This time around are you actually going to build one?

PRIME MINISTER: Well our form is there for people to see. There are two other very big generationally-delayed projects which we’re now getting on with. One of those is of course the Melbourne Airport Link and that heads of agreement has been signed with the state government with Dan Andrews. That was what we announced in last year's Budget, so we're getting on with that. Up in Sydney, the Western Sydney International Airport has been talked about for 45 or 50 years and we're getting on with that. The dozers are on the ground and it's becoming a reality. So I understand that people can be cynical about these very big projects. That's why we decided in this Budget, we didn’t say we were going ahead with five of these things. We said this is the one you can actually do. The State Government has been doing work on this, we're going to do a bit more work on it. We've got $2 billion down to make it a reality and it's the one that we can actually demonstrate our credentials on.

ELLIOTT: Sorry which one is that? The one to the airport or the one to Geelong?

PRIME MINISTER: This is Geelong to Melbourne, the Fast Rail. The Melbourne Airport Link, that's already happening, we're moving ahead on it.

ELLIOTT: OK so the very fast train to Geelong and back, that's a reality? Or will soon be a reality?

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah it will be, both the State Government ourselves have been working towards that. It'll follow a very similar path.

ELLIOTT: You can understand the cynicism though?

PRIME MINISTER: Oh, sure.

ELLIOTT: Because we've talked so much over the years about fast trains, they've never, I don’t think we’ve ever had a train go faster than 100 kms an hour.

PRIME MINISTER: Well we're not talking about the bullet trains like they have in Tokyo, by the way.  That's not what this proposal is. It is a fast train, it's not the bullet trains that you see overseas. This is a half an hour journey between Melbourne and Geelong instead of a one hour journey. We're doing that business case and we'll continue to work through the technical details of that. There’s still a lot of work to do there, I mean, I've often said I think out of Melbourne you don't get these projects at a drive through, you've got to do the work. They take some time to get the planning right, because if you don't get the planning right, you end up spending a lot of money on something doesn't work.

ELLIOTT: Now today in Parliament you said something I found a little bit odd. We'll just have a listen to it.

“I know what Borat with think of the Labour Party's policies on emissions reduction Mr Speaker; very nice, very nice.”

ELLIOTT: Do you often quote Borat in the Federal Parliament?

[Laughter]

PRIME MINISTER: Not very often but I thought it was very appropriate, because under… this is what Labor's emissions reduction policy is - half of their carbon emissions reductions is actually forcing businesses to buy carbon credits from other places outside Australia. Honestly, I've never been a fan of these arrangements, these foreign - I mean that you've got futures carbon traders, you've got all these sort of merchant bankers moving around these sorts of things. Honestly, they're going to force $36 billion worth, that’s our conservative estimate, that they're going to force business to spend on these carbon credits. Carbon credits from Kazakhstan, so to make my point, the Borat tax is where this ends up. This is not a responsible thing to do Australian business. If you want people to earn more, they don't earn more when the business they work for has to spend billions of dollars buying carbon credits from Borat.

ELLIOTT: Very quickly you popped up on Snapchat in the past couple of days and we in fact played one of your videos yesterday. You got a lot of likes a lot of new friends on this social media platform. 

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah look you've got to be everywhere to talk to Australians these days and of all ages. I'm happy to do that, I'm happy to meet people in the pub, I'm happy to meet them at the footy, I'm happy to meet him in a nursing home, I'm happy to meet them on Snapchat. But wherever I can engage with my fellow Australians and get across the point that we're making which is if you don't have a strong economy then your investment in the schools and the hospitals and the pharmaceuticals - I mean, last night we've listed a drug that is going to change the lives of people suffering from leukaemia, people suffering from rare forms of skin cancer - I mean these this is why we do this stuff. This is why for the last six years, we've worked so hard to get this Budget back into surplus, so we can keep doing these things.

But again - I know I started with it when we started talking Tom - but this $461 million that we're investing in combating youth suicide, with more Headspace centres a whole range of digital programs, this is something for every Australian I think. Because we're all touched by the issues of mental health and particularly by youth mental health. This is the way you confront it and we're funding that. I would call it my biggest priority in this Budget.

ELLIOTT: Okay, speaking of footy, last time you and I spoke in person I gave you a Carlton football jumper and made you a member of the club. How do you think the Blues will go against the Swans at Marvel Stadium this Saturday?

PRIME MINISTER: Oh, well I think the Swans will win, but I'm no expert mate.

ELLIOTT: What?

PRIME MINISTER: I’m no expert. We’ll put the tips in but I was there for the Swans game against Richmond, but they had I say seem to be coming good in that that second quarter and the third quarter, it unravelled a bit. I was there with Josh. I'll tell you what, Josh was pretty excited. It was fun going to the footy with Josh actually, I quite enjoyed it.

But look, I enjoy the spectacle you know and I've had a lot of a lot more people give me a lot more jumpers since then. But how good was the fact that the women's AFL grand final on the weekend set that record crowd for a women's sporting event? Was it 45,000?

ELLIOTT: 53,000 or 54,000.

PRIME MINISTER: 54,000, how good is that?

ELLIOTT: Well it was a great crowd, a record crowd for a women's AFL match. I know you’ve got to go, a busy day. Thank you so much for joining us.

PRIME MINISTER: Good on you mate, cheers.

ELLIOTT: Scott Morrison, Prime Minister of Australia.




MICHAEL ROWLAND: Prime Minister Scott Morrison, good morning to you.

PRIME MINISTER: G'day, Michael.

ROWLAND: Isn't this the most nakedly political budget in Australian history?

PRIME MINISTER: Michael, this is our economic plan to ensure that our economy is built strong over the next decade and that Australians have the opportunities that they're seeking for themselves, because this is a Budget that is backing hardworking Australians. It's a fair go for those who have a go, that's what underpins this Budget. As Australians continue to do the hard work, then they'll get the rewards for their hard work. That's what the Liberal and National Parties have always done and that's what has enabled us to bring the Budget back to a surplus budget for next year. That's the first time we have seen that in a decade.

We're going to invest that surplus in infrastructure and services. $461 million to combat youth suicide in this country, that's what a budget surplus and a stronger economy can do to tackle what I think is one of the biggest social and health challenges we have in this country.

ROWLAND: It's a promise of a surplus of $7 billion next financial year, but how robust is that promise given as we saw in the Budget documents last night, very considerable risks from overseas and risks here care of those falling house prices. How confident are you that you'll actually hit that Budget surplus next year and for that matter the years afterwards?

PRIME MINISTER: I’m very confident because that has been our form. I mean, last year when I delivered the Budget, what we’ve seen over the course of this year is that we’ve ended up $10 billion better and it was the same the year before. So we’ve always had these headwinds but we’ve always budgeted in a very conservative way and we have bettered the performance in the Budget consistently.

That's the difference between the Liberal and National Parties when we budget - we do it sensibly - and when the Labor Party did it, you know, they just ran up huge deficits while promising surpluses. Now, that's the big difference between the Labor Party and ourselves; we do these things carefully and responsibly. We balance reward, responsibility and reality when we put our budgets together and that's why we have seen the improvement in the performance of the Budget that we have. But that budget surplus is all about, now, investing to pay down debt and deliver the essential services in health and education. I mean, health and education funding over the last five and a half years, has increased over 60 per cent for state schools and for hospitals. That’s what we have been delivering. A 27 per cent increase in Medicare funding since we’ve come to government. This is what we have been delivering and our Budget that we handed down last night continues that investment, based on a strong economy.

ROWLAND: How much of this Budget, though, is aimed at neutralising Labor politically? I ask that question because the Labor Party has already vowed to match the first round of tax cuts announced last night?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, Labor makes all sorts of promises when it comes to the economy but their record speaks for itself. What this is about is our plan for the decade that we're going to live in. The decade that people are going to run businesses in, that people are going to find work in. 80,000 apprentices funded to support our growing economy and help people get into work and build the big infrastructure projects that we have got rolling out. $100 billion of important investments in infrastructure, whether it's the $500 million that we're putting into the Princes Highway, that notorious stretch of road down on the south coast of New South Wales, or the funds we're funding in Fast Rail from Melbourne to Geelong, $2 billion, which is going to ease population pressures in our big cities.

This is what our plan is doing; it's about growing our economy, taking the tax burden, taking the tax monkey off people's backs - not just for some as Labor promise and they only promise it - but for all. See, the Labor Party always wants to say they’ve got to bring some people down to lift people up. We don't in believe in that. We believe that the Australian economy performs better when all Australians are rewarded for doing better. Labor wants to punish some and we’re not that in business. We're in the business of rewarding and supporting all Australians.

ROWLAND: Let's talk about lifting the poorest people up. In a Budget boasting $45 billion worth of surpluses Prime Minister over four years, why was there no scope at all to raise the Newstart Allowance?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, what we're doing for people who are looking for jobs is getting them into work. The difference about Newstart Allowance is that people on Newstart aren't intended to be there for a long period of time and they also have access to a range of other income support payments. The Newstart Allowance is indexed twice a year, just like all other welfare payments, it's not frozen. It goes up actually twice a year and that's what is built into the Budget going forward.

ROWLAND: It is a measly figure, $277 a week. Even Arthur Sinodinos, your colleague on Q&A on Monday was saying it needs to go up.

PRIME MINISTER: He didn't say now, I stress, he did not say it needed to go up now. He said that's something you consider down the track, but what we're doing is getting those people in record numbers who are on Newstart, into jobs. That's the best form of welfare, Michael. Actually to get people into a job and under our Government, that's what has been happening in record numbers, particularly for young people.

Under our Government, we had the biggest year of employment growth for 15 to 24-year-olds. That changes lives. We have had 1.2 million jobs created since we have come to government and our pledge for a further 1.25 million jobs over the next five years, is backed in by the economic plan that we outlined and we handed down last night.

A Budget back into surplus for the first time in 12 years that now is invested in paying down debt and investing in things like youth mental health, investing in supporting carers to get respite, in record funding for hospitals and for schools. These are the things that make the difference in people's lives.

ROWLAND: Okay, just about out of time. Finally, Prime Minister, we're clearly about to go into election campaign mode. Once election day rolls around, isn't the only surplus Australian voters will be concerned about is the surplus of Liberal prime ministers over the last six years?

PRIME MINISTER: I think that's what the bubble worries about. But what Australians are going to decide at the next election –

ROWLAND: You don't think voters will look back and discount you for all the… for the muppet show, your words, we saw last year?

PRIME MINISTER: I think what they're going to do at the next election is decide who they want to continue to lead the country over the next three years. We changed the rules when I became Prime Minister, we changed the rules in our Party. So at this election, be very sure about this, there's a choice; myself as the leader of the Liberal Party together with the Nationals to lead the country for another three years and keep our economy strong and secure our future. Or, you can have Bill Shorten and the Labor Party with their higher taxes.

You vote for Bill Shorten, you are guaranteed Bill Shorten. You vote for me, Scott Morrison as Prime Minister, you are guaranteed me.  So the choice is about the future. The choice is always about the future in an election and our future, the economy that we will continue to lead, is one where Australians will have better opportunities, higher wages, more growth, more employment, a better future and stronger services.

ROWLAND: Prime Minister, really appreciate your time, thank you so much for joining News Breakfast.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks a lot, Michael.




JON FAINE: The leader of the Liberal Party, the Coalition and Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Morrison good morning to you.

PRIME MINISTER: G’day Jon.

FAINE: Is it a moral fail to build an election surplus off starving the National Disability Insurance Scheme of money, leaving disabled people without the services they need?

PRIME MINISTER: Well that's a terrible lie, Jon.

FAINE: What is?

PRIME MINISTER: What you've just said.

FAINE: What part of it?

PRIME MINISTER: All of it.

FAINE: None of it.

PRIME MINISTER: All of what you've said is untrue. Let me explain why.

FAINE: The NDIS has been starved of funds and it hasn’t met –

PRIME MINISTER: No that’s not right Jon.

PRIME MINISTER: What you yourselves said would be its allocated money and people are desperate for services and not getting them.

PRIME MINISTER: Let me explain what happens with the NDIS. What happens is based on estimates that are provided by the states working with the Commonwealth to understand what the expected demand is, then you pay out what the services are that are provided in response to that demand. Now, we overestimated the demand in the NDIS. That money actually shows up in extra expenditure on hospitals where a lot of those services are being provided through the state. So it's just swings and roundabouts.

FAINE: Well no, you've squeezed the pipe.

PRIME MINISTER: No, not at all. Jon, that’s just out and out wrong, that's not how it works. The NDIS is funded on a complete demand-based system. Every single invoice for every single service, every one presenting for a service, it's all funded. It's all funded not just next year, this year, but into the future. What happens is -

FAINE: Mr Morrison, we’ve spoken to the providers, they do not have the cash flow allocated in order to meet the demand.

PRIME MINISTER: We've just increased the payment and for providers.

FAINE: For the future, but not for the past.

PRIME MINISTER: That's what's been done.

FAINE: Not for the past, hence the surplus.

PRIME MINISTER: Jon I’m sorry, I've got to stop you there because you cannot tell those lies to the Australian people.

FAINE: It's not a lie.

PRIME MINISTER: No, it is a lie Jon. Because every single cent that needs to go to the NDIS, every single demand that is there for the NDIS -

FAINE: [Inaudible] go, doesn’t it?

PRIME MINISTER: Every single service that's provided and sought -

FAINE: No, not every one that is sought.

PRIME MINISTER: No, I'm sorry, Jon. I'm sorry, every demand for the NDIS is fully funded. There are no policy decisions in relation to the NDIS other than every single element of the demand is fully funded. What happens is if you get a lower demand on the NDIS, then you get higher expenses in the hospital system. And so these are the same patients and they're getting the same support, they're getting it through a different system.

FAINE: No, they’re not. A lot of them are not hospital patients.

PRIME MINISTER: I’m sorry Jon, you’ve got this absolutely wrong.

FAINE: Prime Minister, they're not hospital patients, they're not admitted, they're not outpatients.

PRIME MINISTER: But they are paid for through the health system Jon.

FAINE: They’re not clients of hospitals at all. They’re paid through community organisations and charities and they need more money.

PRIME MINISTER: I’m sorry Jon, you cannot put that falsehood up just because that's what the Labor Party is saying -

FAINE: It’s also what the providers are saying -

PRIME MINISTER: Again, if you want to repeat the lies of the Labor Party to your listeners -

FAINE: It’s not the Labor Party, it’s the people who work their fingers to the bone for the disabled.

PRIME MINISTER: You can do that, but if we’re going to have a debate, we can have a debate or we can have an interview.

FAINE: Well we can have both actually, I'm trying to explore one of the major issues in the Budget.

PRIME MINISTER: And you’ve got it wrong, Jon.

FAINE: All right well let's move on to other things but I'm basing my beliefs not on what the Labor Party have briefed us on.

PRIME MINISTER: Well there’s an uncanny coincidence

FAINE: But the disability sector, it’s what the disability sector have put in their own press releases. Let's move on. If indeed on tax and macroeconomic settings alike there's little difference between the parties now, does this election become a contest of leadership, where of course you have a significant advantage in the polls and the different opinion polls on Bill Shorten?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it’s a contest of both. It is a contest about who's best to lead the country going forward and it is also about the record of our Government, which has seen hospital funding increase by 63 per cent since we were first elected. Schools funding for public schools has increased by 62 per cent. Medicare funding increased by 27 per cent, a Budget that -

FAINE: All these figures of course are contested by your opponents.

PRIME MINISTER: No they’re not contested, they're the hard facts of what has occurred since we were elected until now. They are the financial accounts of the nation, Jon. They're not contested, they're actual facts. That is what we've done with hospitals, schools and Medicare. We also have the highest bulk-billing rate in the country on record. That is our record on health and services.

But the other thing we've done last night, Jon, I'm sure you'd agree with this - we disagree on things from time to time, I'm sure your listeners understand and they know it's good natured - but $461 million dollars to invest in combating youth suicide and the youth mental health challenge in this country. From the most remote Indigenous communities to the suburbs of our big cities, that is what a strong economy and a balanced Budget can do.

FAINE: Desperately needed. Just a few things, we’ll come to infrastructure in a moment which is a very welcome commitment from your Government. Do you commit to Bill Shorten making his Budget reply?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I did that ages ago.

FAINE: You won't call the election this evening then?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

FAINE: And then Friday?

PRIME MINISTER: I committed to that last year Jon, why would that change?

FAINE: Because the rumor mill runs hot as I'm sure you're aware.

PRIME MINISTER: You shouldn’t pay attention to the bubble Jon, you’ve been around too long to pay attention to the bubble.

[Laughter]

FAINE: Every now and again there's one that goes past and you go; “Ooh, that would be interesting”. So having got that sorted, Geelong in particular.

PRIME MINISTER: Yep.

FAINE: The commitments to try and save Sarah Henderson in the very marginal Victorian seat of Corangamite. When does the money for Geelong Fast Rail start to flow?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, once we've completed the business case. When we were down there launching it the other day, we expect that to be in about 18 months to two years.

FAINE: Sorry, the business case?

PRIME MINISTER: No, the business case needs to be done which works out the most effective way to do this, that's the first stage of the plan.

FAINE: When does that start?

PRIME MINISTER: That starts now.

FAINE: $20 million for year one, starting right now?

PRIME MINISTER: That starts right away.

FAINE: Yeah and then?

PRIME MINISTER: Then when we put that together, it works exactly like we work the Melbourne Airport Rail Link. As you know, we announced that in last year's Budget and were able to conclude the agreement, $5 billion each with Dan Andrews and the Victorian Government and ourselves. This will follow exactly the same process, working closely together, because the Victorian Government, as you know, has already done quite a lot of work on this. So we'll align those two pieces of work and we'll get moving as quickly as we come to that agreement with the State Government. We look forward to doing that and I have every confidence that we will. We’re working very well with Dan Andrews.

FAINE: But you’re press conference the other day with lots of people in fluoro vests and hard hats - and we're going to see more of that - you said it can start in 18 months, but in fact, the cash flow doesn't kick in until 2021?

PRIME MINISTER: Well we can. It's a function of getting the business case landed and it's a function of getting the agreement together with the State Government.

FAINE: So how can it start in 18 months when cash flow starts in three years?

PRIME MINISTER: Jon, as soon as we can get it moving, we'll begin moving. That's exactly what we're doing and we'll do it with the State Government and we're moving on all these projects. There is $6.2 billion for new projects to bust congestion, improve safety and better connect towns and regions all across Victoria. This is a huge boost.

FAINE: I'm just trying to drill down, Prime Minister, because in fact it can't start in 18 months if the cash flow isn't kicking till the 1st of July 2021.

PRIME MINISTER: Jon, if we're in a position to start earlier, we will.

FAINE: And the duplication to Waurn Ponds, allocating $50 million over four years, but it's a $750 million project.

PRIME MINISTER: We've allocated $700 million to the Waurn Ponds upgrade.

FAINE: $50 million in four years, the rest might follow.

PRIME MINISTER: $700 million to upgrade that project, that's what we've committed in this Budget. That's what we've committed, $700 million.

FAINE: So the actual expenditure is not just beyond the forward estimates of this Budget, but within them.

PRIME MINISTER: There is expenditure now and there's expenditure over 10 years, it's a big project Jon. You can't upgrade the Waurn Ponds line by going through a drive through at McDonald's, you've got to do the planning, you've got to get it done you've got to work with the state government. I don't think people expect these projects to be done overnight. But you've got to turn up and provide the funds and that's what we're doing.

FAINE: So do you borrow the credibility that was built by the Andrews government and their model that led to them being re-elected? Do you say, well, we haven't really done that much for infrastructure in Victoria for the last few years, but forgive us, we've realised that the error of our ways and we're going to do it now?

PRIME MINISTER: Well that's not true either, Jon. I mean you've got to stop saying this stuff, we've been delivering billions of dollars of infrastructure projects in Victoria and we're going to continue to deliver billions of dollars

FAINE: Sorry, your main commitment was for a tunnel the people of Victoria people voted against twice in elections.

PRIME MINISTER: For these projects, so we’re just going to keep getting on with it, Jon. We're investing in infrastructure, we're investing in infrastructure in Victoria and particularly in Melbourne which is straining with the pressures of population and ensuring that we're delivering the projects. Whether it's on the Hume Freeway, the $50 million there, for the M80 Ring Road, the Calder Freeway, the Gap Road, the M80 Ring Road, that's $50 million, the Ballarto Road at Skye which is $30 million, the Princes Highway intersection upgrades at Pakenham to Beaconsfield, that's s$17.8 million.

FAINE: This is what governments do, of course Prime Minister.

PRIME MINISTER: We’re doing all of these things Jon.

FAINE: That’s why we vote for governments, to do things.

PRIME MINISTER: That's exactly what we're doing Jon.

FAINE: But do you have a credibility problem, not just on infrastructure where Victorians for years have been calling for more investment from the Commonwealth, but for instance your apprenticeships announcement. Billions cut from TAFE over years and years and suddenly now you say you'll put some of that back?

PRIME MINISTER: We established the Skilling Australians Fund last year Jon, that was in last year's Budget. We've been investing in these skills each and every year. As you know, the training programs are delivered particularly by state governments when it comes to TAFE. 80,000 new apprentices, we're going to need them because we're building a lot of roads and a lot of bridges and we're building our economy. That's why we're investing in those with the increased incentives for employers and for those taking on apprenticeships. But not just that -

FAINE: But where's your credibility on apprenticeships, if you've in fact, as you have, been cutting TAFE? You may have been putting money into private training up providers.

PRIME MINISTER: State governments fund TAFE, Jon. State governments fund TAFE.

FAINE: Well specifically with monies allocated from the Commonwealth.

PRIME MINISTER: They're substantially funded by state governments. They're the responsibility of state governments and what we're doing here - I mean, I've seen people pour money into those programs and TAFE and not get the outcomes.

FAINE: Absolutely, rorts and rip-offs, many of them.

PRIME MINISTER: The great mistakes that is often made it that you just throw buckets of money into state government programs and they produce results. Now, particularly in the area of skills development, I haven't seen those results. We've been investing year in year out in those state government programs all around the country and we haven't been seeing the results. So we've decided to take more direct action when it comes to investing in skills through these programs, by investing in the incentives provided to employers and to those taking up apprenticeships to make sure they can get out there.

So 80,000 in the most needed trades and we're looking forward to backing them in to do that, over half a billion dollars in this Budget to do just that.

FAINE: I don't want to make you late for your next commitment but just finally, extending the energy supplement to Newstart seems like an afterthought that was announced by the Treasurer on radio this morning, not in the Budget.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I want to see it passed through the Parliament and that's what is going to happen.

FAINE: Was it an afterthought?

PRIME MINISTER: That will be in the Government's bill this morning when it's introduced into the House -

FAINE: Was it an afterthought?

PRIME MINISTER: No it's in the bill and it's the Government's policy.

FAINE: But it wasn't in the Budget.

PRIME MINISTER: Jon, we’re getting it done.

FAINE: An afterthought.

PRIME MINISTER: I'll tell you why it's important. Because this year's Budget, the year we're currently in, which was the Budget I handed down last year, we have bettered what I said a year ago by around about $10 billion and in the previous year, we did exactly the same thing. So with our Government, when we hand down budgets, we outperform them in the 12 months that follow, because we use conservative estimates. We balance reward with responsibility and reality when we put our budgets together and that's why Australians trust us.

People know Labor can't manage money and they can't trust Labor to deliver tax cuts, legislated tax cuts. We're providing that relief and we're providing the economic leadership. So there’s a very clear choice at the next election; Bill Shorten and the Labor Party - and we all know what that is. Or you can have my Party with me leading it at the next election and there’s a very clear choice.

FAINE: Just finally Prime Minister, I'm trying to organise a birthday party for Jan my wife and her birthday is May the 11th, should I go ahead?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I’m going to be busy all the way through mate, be busy all the way through. When we announce the election, you'll know when it is.

[Laughter]

And was that an invitation?

FAINE: Well yeah, absolutely, drop on by.

PRIME MINISTER: That’s very kind.

FAINE: If you've got nothing else on, you’re always welcome.

PRIME MINISTER: I'll send a videogram.

[Laughter]

FAINE: She would love that, thank you indeed.

PRIME MINISTER: Good on you, Jon.

FAINE: The Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison.

ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TREASURY AND FINANCE, THE HON ZED SESEJA: It’s great to be here at the Icon Cancer Centre here in Bruce and it’s great of course to have the Prime Minister and the Health Minister with us today and to have some of our local candidates in Mina Zaki and Leanne Castley. It’s great to be talking about what the Coalition can deliver particularly in the health space and particularly for cancer patients. So great to be with you today in sunny ACT and without further ado I’ll welcome the Prime Minister.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much Zed and congratulations - as Assistant Minister to the Treasurer and Finance Minister I know you’ve been very busy in recent weeks and months as we prepare for tomorrow night’s Budget. Tomorrow night’s Budget is all about building a stronger economy to secure Australia’s future. A stronger economy means we now have the highest level of bulk billing in Australia’s history under Medicare. A stronger economy means we now have record funding for Medicare. That's what the strong economy that we’ve been presiding over is delivering; a stronger Medicare. A stronger economy means hospitals funding is now at record levels from the Commonwealth, all around the country. A stronger healthcare system is dependent upon a strong economy and a strong Budget and tomorrow night you will see both of those in action.

Today, a stronger economy and a strong Budget means that we can list two further pharmaceuticals, life-saving medicines, on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to make them affordable for cancer patients. More than 2,000 medicines have been listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme under our Government. That's because we know how to run a Budget. It's because we know how to preside over a strengthening economy and taking the decisions, through lower taxes, supporting small and family businesses, opening up our export markets so our exporters, particularly small and family businesses can be out there growing and employing more Australians and more Australians in work. There are more Australians in work today of working age, as a proportion, than at any other time in our history. There are fewer Australians on welfare today of working age, than we've seen in over 30 years. That's what a strong economy delivers. But when Labor were in power, they had to stop listing medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme because they ran out of your money.

So, as we go into tomorrow night's Budget, a stronger economy guarantees funding for the essential services that you rely on. Not higher taxes, that only slows the economy. That only undermines our ability to invest in the healthcare and the education and the security that you depend on as an Australian, for you, your family and your community. So today is another example, another demonstration of what the practical benefit of a strong economy is for you and your family; life-saving medicines. In this case, a very Australian form of cancer, skin cancer and a very specific type of skin cancer which is being treated here at the Icon Cancer Centre here. Wayne has been able to benefit, he’ll talk to you as well as Megan in a few minutes' time and of course, we’re listing drugs on breast cancer as well. Now we have done a lot on breast cancer and Greg will talk to you about that in just a second. 

But my real message today is; a stronger economy, a strong Budget, a budget surplus that only a Coalition Government can deliver, is what guarantees the essential services you rely on. That is demonstrated here again today, with yet two more listings for important life-saving drugs, which is changing the lives of people who are standing here with me today and their families. It's happening all around the country. Greg, congratulations on another listing and why don't you take us through the details?

MINISTER FOR THE HEALTH, THE HON GREG HUNT: Thanks very much to the Prime Minister, to Leanne and Zed and Mina but, in particular and most importantly to our patients here, to Wayne and Jonathan and Megan. Today is about saving lives and protecting lives. It’s about saving lives and protecting lives off the back of a strong economy that allows us to invest in the PBS and other essential services. I'm delighted to announce that, as of 1 May, two new medicines will be added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Ibrance for advanced breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer will be added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It will help over 3,000 Australian women who have advanced breast cancer. That's a condition that goes to their certainty, their confidence, their ability to be with their families. It's a life-saving and life-changing and life-prolonging medicine. This is one of the most important things we can ever do to give these women real hope and real treatment and a real pathway forward. It would otherwise cost over $55,000 a year, now it will be down to as low as $6.50 a script for concessional patients. In addition, I'm delighted to announce that Bavencio, for a rare skin cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma will be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This medicine has saved Wayne’s life and it has saved Jonathan's life. Without that medicine, they wouldn't be here today. It's a rare condition, Merkel cell carcinoma. It affects 160 patients that are likely to benefit from this medicine and it would have cost over $150,000 a year. That's almost impossible for almost any patient in Australia. So this will save lives and protect lives and will give new access to patients who suffer from this most Australian of rare cancers. It’s just our absolute privilege to announce these new medicines.

PRIME MINISTER: And Megan is another Australian hero who survived breast cancer since 1996, congratulations.

MEGAN JAMES, BREAST CANCER NETWORK: Thank you.

PRIME MINISTER: It’s great to have you here with us today. Why don't you tell us a bit about what you think this means for breast cancer patients all around the country?

MEGAN JAMES: Certainly. Well I sit on the board of Breast Cancer Network Australia and we'd like to acknowledge the support that Minister Hunt and yourself have given us not only today but an ongoing basis. We’re sure it will be ongoing, from our point of view we have a very strong voice. This makes a great difference to those women with metastatic breast cancer. It means they are able to live their lives, see their kids grow up, meet their grandchildren and do the sorts of things that a lot of us take for granted. I'm representing them here today in my capacity as a board member.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you very much Megan. So whether it’s breast care nurses through the McGrath Foundation which we started the year off talking about, whether it’s the research we’re putting in for breast cancer or it’s the drugs we’re listing today to support women with breast cancer, we're in the fight with women and families who are fighting breast cancer. Congratulations on winning your own fight.

MEGAN JAMES: Thank you and I think it is wonderful just to see the breast cancer groups coming together and partnering around these announcements as well. It's bringing everybody together for a greater cause, for the community and Australia.

PRIME MINISTER: Great and I’ll ask Wayne and Jonathan to come up. Now Wayne is a reasonably handy tennis player he tells me and Jonathan as he said before, is an economist and used to work at the Productivity Commission. Those two points are interesting but what’s more important today is how this drug has changed their lives. Tell us a bit about that?

WAYNE LIEBERMAN, PATIENT: Well look, 12 months ago I had a very short horizon to look forward to. It wasn't good. I went on to Bavencio and in three months, the metastasized tumours throughout my body all cleared. It’s quite an amazing drug. Having said that I think, on behalf of all the patients around Australia that have been living with this short horizon, this drug offers hope to them. For every future patient being diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, they now have a future. It’s just an amazing thing we've done with this PBS listing, not only for patients, it's the partners, the family and friends.

PRIME MINISTER: And Jonathan, you've been funding your own treatment?

JONATHAN PINCUS, PATIENT: I’ve funded my own yes, which is an enormous expense which I could afford but most Australians couldn't afford it. Now they'll get access, which is a marvelous thing to happen. I wish to thank the Government for agreeing with what PBAC suggested, that was tremendous for patients, as Wayne said.

PRIME MINISTER: It’s good health and it’s good economics.

JONATHAN PINCUS: It’s very good economics.

PRIME MINISTER: He is an economist.

WAYNE LIEBERMAN: It's helped my tennis as well!

[Laughter]

Just one of the side benefits of the whole system.

PRIME MINISTER: Fantastic, well thank you very much for sharing your stories. The PBS to me spells “H-O-P-E”. That's what it means to millions of Australians around the country and that's why we invest in it. It’s an investment in real hope, because it has changed lives. Whether we’re talking about lung cancer with Tagrisso or breast cancer or ovarian cancer or skin cancer; all of these, we are in the war against cancer and the fight against cancer. What fuels our army on this is the strong economy and the strong Budget. Without that, you're going into battle with nothing. That's what you need to fight cancer, having these drugs to support us in this battle. So it’s very pleasing to be here today. Let's take questions particularly on the announcements today and Wayne and Megan and Jonathan will be here to help us with that and then I'm happy to move on to other issues of the day.

JOURNALIST: My question is going to be more about the Budget.

PRIME MINISTER: Why don't we deal with this first, then happy to take those questions.

JOURNALIST: When will these medications be rolled out, available to people?

MINISTER FOR HEALTH: The 1st of May.

JOURNALIST: Do you have an estimation perhaps of how many lives you think it might save or how many people it might impact?

MINISTER FOR HEALTH: Certainly it will help 3,000 women in terms of Ibrance and the breast cancer medicine. It will help 160 patients for what is a rare cancer, but an unaffordable medicine in terms of Bavencio. So we know that well over 3,000 patients will benefit from these and we hope that in the vast majority of cases, it will be an absolute game-changer.

JOURNALIST: I think we all recognise the importance of today's announcement but are you concerned your big-spending Budget might look like you’re trying to buy up seats for the election?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I wouldn't describe it like that at all. The Budget is on tomorrow night, I think that you will see very plainly that our Government has the lowest growth in Commonwealth public expenditure of any government in 50 years. So we are the government that has been most successful of any government in 50 years in keeping expenditure under control. That's why we'll be handing down a budget surplus tomorrow night, the first in 12 years. It's been about keeping expenditure under control and it's been about supporting the growth in the Australian economy and getting Australians off welfare and into work. It's the classic 12-point turn around - that works in AFL as well as NRL - you know, you stop one team scoring a goal down one end and you score yourself down the other. This is what we’re doing in the economy. People who were receiving welfare, under our Government are now paying tax because they have jobs. That's how you balance a Budget. That's how you bring the Budget back to strength.

In terms of the announcement we made yesterday, the Australian economy and the Budget we have been able to manage over the past year has come in stronger, once again. In each of the budgets I handed down, in the final budget outcome, they have all proved to be stronger than what I announced on Budget night. We believe it's only fair - it's only fair that we share that dividend with Australians who need it most, those who are receiving pension payments all around the country. I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to do to ensure that when your Budget has performed better than you set out the year before, that the benefit of that actually is shared with Australians, whether they be pensioners or others to receive at least some assistance to deal with their cost-of-living pressures.

So our Government has the most restraint and discipline on expenditure of any government, in fact better than any government over the last 50 years. That's our record. That's why we’re in a position today to announce these types of measures.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given Bill Shorten's climate change announcement, his electric car target, do you worry what impact that will have on fuel excise receipts going forward?

PRIME MINISTER: Let me make two points about this. The first one is, Bill Shorten does not have a plan, he just has another tax. That's all this is. Bill Shorten does not have a plan, he just has a tax and he's got more than $200 billion worth of higher taxes. This one is even higher than all of those individually up until now.

What we've got here is a ‘re-Rudd’ of a failed policy that costs jobs, that costs businesses, that will cost Australians at least $9,000 a year, with the reckless targets that Bill Shorten will make law. That's what he's announcing today. He will make that reckless target law in this country.

You make the point about electric vehicles. Well, the Government is already taking a number of steps to support the growth in electric vehicles. I mean, if you buy an electric vehicle, one of the things you don't pay is fuel excise. That is already a major advantage for those who are buying electric vehicles, a big, significant leg-up. We're also investing, ensuring through the CEFC and other projects that we're putting in place the charging stations and the other infrastructure you need around the country to see that growth in the electric vehicle industry be realised.

But Labor as I understand it are talking about taking it, in 10 years from 0.2 per cent of the market to 50 per cent. Now, he needs to explain how he's going to make that happen, because you know what happens if he doesn't? It means because he's legislated his reckless target, he has to come back and get that money off you. He's got to come back when it fails and we saw this the last time they were in government; they had all these fanciful schemes that set fire to people's roofs and overpriced school halls and all of this madness. Australians were the ones who ended up paying for the ill-thought-through policies by the Labor Party. That is what we’re seeing again today. It's not a plan, it’s just another big Shorten tax on the Australian public.

JOURNALIST: Speaking about plans, the $285 million you’re going to give back to people to help pay their power bills, doesn't that just show the Government doesn't have an energy plan?

PRIME MINISTER: No, it shows that we’ve outperformed our Budget. We have outperformed our Budget and we’re in a position to provide some modest relief going into this next bill. We already have a plan, we’ve got the Reliability Guarantee which is in place, ensuring that those investing in reliable power in this country can have the certainty of the reliable energy guarantee that we have already made a fact in this country. We’ve got the underwriting of generation capability, around 4,000 megawatts of capacity which we announced just last week and that is about twice the size of Liddell power station in New South Wales.

JOURNALIST: That's a stretch isn’t it Prime Minister?

PRIME MINISTER: That's a fact.

JOURNALIST: You don't have a NEG plan, which is the reason you’re giving money back to people. [Inaudible] should have been getting people money back off their power bill, but because they’re not going to get that, you have to find a way to reward them and get their votes.

PRIME MINISTER: No that's not how it works. The difference when it comes to the National Energy Guarantee in terms of what Labor are proposing is this; the Reliability Guarantee, which was part of the NEG that we brought forward at the time, that is now happening. That's the important part. The bit that Labor are applying to that is legislating a 45 per cent emissions reduction target. That's what Labor are doing and they’re going to legislate that. That's not going to reduce power prices, it’s going to increase wholesale electricity prices by 56 per cent. So Labor's NEG actually put prices up, not down, because they are going to legislate a reckless target that will hit wages, that will hit jobs, that will hit production.

Let's not forget what they've also announced today is the extension effectively of the native veg laws in Queensland from the Queensland Labor Government which is basically going to land-lock the country and tell farmers and graziers and pastoralists all around the country what they can do - or rather what they can’t do - with their own land. This is a massive tax on agricultural Australia. It's a massive tax on jobs. It's $35 billion that Australian companies are going to have to spend, sending money offshore to foreign carbon traders. Carbon credits for Kazakhstan, that’s what this is for. $35 billion that companies in Australia are going to have to shell out to meet Bill Shorten's reckless target. That is going to have a significant impact on the Australian economy. This is on top of the $200 billion in higher taxes. This is why I say what Bill Shorten's talking about is not a plan, it's just another big tax.

JOURNALIST: Just on the M1 in Queensland, a 50/50 funding split, why was that?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, this is the traditional arrangement for these projects. We’ve already invested over $1 billion into the M1 upgrade and now we are putting another half a billion. That’s on top of the congestion-busting work that we’re doing on the ramps around the M1 which I was announcing a little while ago. So we are turning up with real money, real cheques to upgrade the M1. It’s frustrating that the Queensland State Government have been unable to manage their own money and unwilling to actually join us in a lot of these projects.

I mean we’re getting on with building projects in the Victoria with the Labor Government and in New South Wales with the Liberal Government, so it’s not about politics. We are just happy to work with people who actually want to get things done. Those funds are there, they’re committed, they’re in the Budget, they’re in the baselines to ensure we can build this important infrastructure for Queensland. We are keen for the Queensland Government to work with us on it, that's what people in south east Queensland need. They’re feeling the population pressures, just like they are in Sydney and Melbourne. This investment in the M1 enables us to get ahead of that congestion pressure which will be coming in south east Queensland, so parents can get home sooner and safer from work, that tradies can get onsite and not sit in traffic jams. That’s why congestion-busting infrastructure grows our economy; because it frees our cities up to go forward and to create jobs and be the economic success stories they can be.

JOURNALIST: That $700 million for Geelong, will that still be there even if Sarah Henderson doesn't win the marginal seat?

PRIME MINISTER: It's in the Budget so yes that’s there. See, this is not a promise, this is a Budget. This is a Budget and we are committed to the satellite cities approach that I announced as part of the population management plan. Whether it's the Fast Rail that connects up Geelong, whether it's the increased investment in the Waurn Ponds line, whether it is the North South Rail links, whether it's any of these projects, these are all about managing Australia's population growth. We have got a balanced plan which deals with sensible migration settings, works closely together with State and Territory governments to ensure our planning is in line for services like hospitals and schools and roads. It's also about the big investments in the infrastructure like Waurn Ponds and the Fast Rail, as well as the smaller investments on the smallest intersections you can imagine which are chokepoints in our cities. It's about investing in the social cohesion of our cities as well and we've made investments of tens of millions of dollars in supporting our communities to grow together, not grow apart.

JOURNALIST: The North-South corridor in South Australia, is that new money? Is that money on the table or is it in the forward estimates? A question from South Australia, that 1.5 billion?

PRIME MINISTER: It's all new money.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister on the Islamic State, there’s a few people trying to come back to Australia to serve jail time - potentially – here and bring kids back. Are you comfortable with that?

PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to put one Australian life at risk to try and extract people from these dangerous situations, I think Australians would certainly support that. I think it's appalling that Australians have gone and fought against our values and our way of life and peace-loving countries of the world, in joining the Daesh fight. I think it's even more despicable that they put their children in the middle of it.

We currently have legislation that we have been seeking to pass on temporary exclusion orders, which would enable us to manage it effectively like a parole scheme, if people were to come back into the country. Labor are playing games with this legislation. But that doesn't really surprise me, I mean Labor always have to be dragged kicking and screaming when it comes to national security legislation.

I assume that's why they seem quite comfortable with the fact they'll preference the Greens, who want to abolish the US alliance, have opposed pretty much every form of national security legislation and anti-terror legislation we’ve put in place. Labor think that the Greens are actually a more viable and more reasonable and an aligned Party when it comes to their outlook on the world, rather than another mainstream party, which is the Liberal Party, which stands for the US alliance. Now, the Labor Party have got to apply their own rule to their own decisions. If they want to have this rule which says minor parties should be considered separate to the mainstream parties, well, it seems that the Labor Party doesn't think the Greens have these extreme views. They've got to apply the same rule to themselves.

We've made our decisions on this. The challenge is on Labor now. Are you for national security? Are you for the US alliance? Are you for border protection? Are you against death taxes? Now if that is your view, if you are for all of those things, then by all means put the Greens ahead of the Liberal Party. But if you're not, then you shouldn't do that.

Thanks very much.

MELISSA MCINTOSH, LIBERAL CANDIDATE FOR LINDSAY: Good morning, I’m Melissa McIntosh the Liberal candidate for Lindsay. Thank you for being here today and for at the Penrith Regional Sports Centre, and Luke thank you for having us here. To Prime Minister Scott Morrison, welcome back to Penrith. We have Australia’s Sports Minister Brigit McKenzie here today and Marise Payne, the Senator for Western Sydney.

Healthy active lifestyles are part of my plan for Lindsay and as a mum of three children and having a husband who is an Olympic athlete, I know the importance of investment in grassroots sport, just like here today and how that makes people more active in our community, it creates the champions of the future. I’d like to welcome the Prime Minister Scott Morrison to make a special announcement here in Penrith. Thank you Prime Minister.

PRIME MINISTER: Well thank you Melissa and it’s great to be here with Marise and Bridget as well. This is not an unfamiliar place to so many parents and kids all around the country. Saturday morning sport, whether it’s in the basketball stadium, the netball court, down at the football pitch, the rugby league oval or on the AFL oval, wherever you happen to be this morning, this is not an unfamiliar sight.

There is nothing better, frankly, than seeing kids get together and playing sport. This is where the champions of tomorrow come from, of course they do. But, more importantly, this is where kids just have a great time, get together, live a healthy lifestyle and get to know the importance of teamwork friendship. These are the sorts of places that bring Australians together.

So, as Prime Minister, I want to see our economy remain strong, so we can invest in the things that keep Australians safe and the essential services that Australians rely on, that also bring Australians together. That’s why today I want to make sure that boys and girls all have the same opportunities, equal access to the sort of facilities that they need in order to participate in these sorts of sports today and into the future.

I was up swimming at the Valley Pool in Brisbane earlier this week and that’s where Madam Butterfly Susie O'Neill used to train. I thought to myself, “Imagine what it would be like if the Valley Pool didn’t have a girls’ changing room.” We would never have seen the sort of wonderful talent in women’s sport particularly in that area. But the same is true today; whether with soccer or AFL or rugby league or hockey or even in basketball and other sports like that, so many more girls are playing these sports and it’s absolutely fantastic. But it means we need to upgrade the facilities to make sure there are opportunities for girls and boys.

So today we are pleased to announce that we are putting into next weeks’ Budget, $190 million into our sports program, which Bridget will tell you more about. The principal objective of that is to ensure that there are changing facilities and other facilities to support more girls and women’s participation in sport all around the country. The facilities have to be there. So, we are very excited about this. This is how you bring Australians together. In Australia, we do that so much through sport, the clubs, the community that comes together and gets around sport. So, this is an investment in the cohesiveness of our community, in our communities coming together and forming friendships, lasting relationships, which underpin the strength of our communities. Whether it is here in Western Sydney, which Melissa knows very well, and Marise knows very well, as Western Sydney residents or anywhere else in the country, this is what makes Australia so great. I am so pleased to be making that announcement and Bridget will go through that in just a second.

The other thing we are announcing today is a major investment in next weeks’ Budget in keeping Australians safe. Some $570 million will be invested in the AFP, ASIO and other security agencies to combat the real threats that our whole society faces, particularly in relation to terrorism. That is going to keep Australians safe into the future, that money is going into the area of counter-terrorism, dealing with all the extremist threats we face. Today we are monitoring eight times more people than we were five years ago. Now, it’s sad that it’s necessary, but it is, to keep Australians safe. That’s why we need to keep investing more in our security agencies and our Federal Police to keep Australians safe.

So whether it’s keeping Australians safe, keeping Australians together like we are today with this community sports program to support girls going into sport, all of this is made possible by the first thing – that is to keep our economy strong. Without a strong economy, you can't invest in these important services.

We will keep the economy strong. You will see that in next week's Budget and we will do that without increasing taxes, but by continuing to back the hard work of Australians that make our economy stronger.

SENATOR THE HON BRIDGET MCKENZIE, MINISTER FOR REGIONAL SERVICES, SPORT, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND DECENTRALISATION : Thanks PM and what a fantastic announcement. As Sports Minister, as outlined in our National Sports Plan ‘Sport 2030’, our Government wants Australia to be the most healthy and active nation, known internationally for our sporting success and our sporting integrity. That starts by investing right here, in community clubs like this. We have had our Community Sports Infrastructure Fund, which is completely oversubscribed - the first $60 million we had nearly $400 million worth of applications. Nearly 2,000 clubs from basketball, AFL, netball, lacrosse, you name it, they put their requests in. Because, for all the mums and dads out there who on Saturdays like this, are out ferrying kids from club to club and sport to sport, keeping them active, and then they’ve got to be one of 1.8 million volunteers in sport across this country, getting out to Bunnings and doing the sausages to raise the money to actually invest back into the community.

One of the great success stories, I think, for us as a nation has been our female international sports stars. Our Matildas, the Southern Stars cricketers, AFLW has its grand final tomorrow in Adelaide, our Rugby Union, our Rugby League girls. Now their success has meant that in clubs right around the country, there has been a tsunami of interest from young women and girls heading into clubs in the local communities, aspiring to be what they have now seen; aspiring to be that next generation of elite athlete in those once male-dominated sports. Which is fantastic, right? We want to see that happen but it has meant that there’s a lot of pressure points in our local clubs, community clubs in those codes. That means when as Sports Minister I walk into change rooms right across the country of every code, every creed, every colour, and you walk into a boys’ change room and there’s one place to go to the toilet and there’s one showerhead to have a shower after the game. Now, young women and girls don’t necessarily like to do that after a game, we’ve got young women getting changed in cars, we’ve got people getting changed behind towels, we’ve got worse still, young women and girls after their games leaving the club, heading home to have a shower and get changed and not bothering to come back. One of the great things about participating in a sports club is that sense of connectedness, of scoring the next game and sitting round and barracking for the seniors and thinking; “One day I’m going to be out on that field or on that court being as good as they are.”

So keeping young women and girls in local clubs, that sense of belonging, means investing in girls change rooms, facilities that include everybody. That’s why it’s fantastic that, as part of $190 million, yes, we’ve got $42.5 million going into another round of that Community Infrastructure Grant which is being used for increasing participation of all groups in our society, but specifically $150 million from our federal government into female change rooms, into making sure our swimming pools are exactly as we need them to be for the next generation. Because we’ve got a goal; we know inactivity is a problem in this country and every one dollar we spend on sport and physical activity gives us a $7 return in the health budget. We know sport is good for you physically, we know it’s great for you mentally and we also know it keeps families and communities together. That’s why we’re very, very proud to invest in this type of infrastructure, into communities, because we know that, yes, we’ll produce the next generation of elite athletes, but we’ll also produce the D Grade netballers who are 50, who are still enjoying their sport, staying active and connected with their community. Thank you.

SENATOR THE HON MARISE PAYNE, MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: I’d just say Prime Minister, these two announcements today in Bridget’s area with Melissa and the Prime Minister here, are very important right across Western Sydney. We’ve seen contributions from the Community Sports Grants program to the Kingsway Fields at Saint Marys, Hunter Fields at Emu Plains, the softball diamond at Glenmore Park, already making a difference to clubs for girls and the boys who play in those sports. So, as we increase the numbers of young women playing sport around Penrith, we look forward to supporting them the way they deserve to be supported and maximizing their participation. So, Prime Minister and Bridget McKenzie, thank you very much for what you’re delivering here in Western Sydney today.

PRIME MINISTER: Happy to take some questions first on these two topics which I have raised and then we can take on other issues. Well, everyone is excited about sport, that’s good. The kids are excited about sport and the Panthers are out there against the Storm out at Bathurst.

MINISTER FOR REGIONAL SERVICES, SPORT, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND DECENTRALISATION: Go Storm!

[Laughter]

PRIME MINISTER: I’ll be backing the Panthers against the Storm I can assure you of that.

[Cheers]

And to Gal, game 329 up there at SMILES Stadium in Townsville, we’ll have a big announcement also up there in Townsville today. So great to see the Cowboys up there in north Queensland, they did such a great job after the floods. I was up there firsthand to see what the Cowboys did up there and it was great to be able to support them and the facilities that they need. We’re making an announcement up there today. But I won’t be wishing them well on the field today, I’ll be looking for the Sharks to take it home against the Cowboys.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister can I ask you a question on NDIS, can you confirm the NDIS underspend this financial year and next will be returned to consolidated revenue?

PRIME MINISTER: All these details are dealt with in the Budget. It’s on Tuesday night.

JOURNALIST: Why haven’t participants been fully utilizing their plans and therefore getting all the services they’ve been assessed as needing?

PRIME MINISTER: That makes assumptions that aren’t necessarily true.

JOURNALIST: You announced tougher social media legislation you’d like to get through this week?

PRIME MINISTER: Yep.

JOURNALIST: Can you talk us through how you’d enforce that legislation?

PRIME MINISTER: Look, the social media laws that we’ll be introducing to the Parliament this week are about calling out the social media companies on their responsibilities. They have a responsibility when they put these platforms into public use, to make sure they are safe and that they cannot be weaponized by terrorists. Similarly, they shouldn't be able to be weaponized for other forms of harm that can affect the youngest of us around here today, through to the most serious of criminal offences.

They have the technology to do this and they have the opportunity to do it. We’re going to insist that they do it and if they don't, they will face the steepest financial penalties imaginable for them. And on top of that, prison terms for executives who are found responsible. So, we need to put that legislation in place to make sure these social media companies take responsibility, use the technology they build to ensure they can protect against their platforms being weaponized by terrorists. Now this is something we will put into the Parliament next week, we will take it to our Party Room, we will engage with the Opposition, we will seek to do that as quickly as possible. I had the opportunity to discuss it yesterday with Prime Minister Ardern when I was in New Zealand. It is a matter I have already taken up with Prime Minister Abe, the President of the G20 this year. We will be taking, basically, our package forward as a very constructive way of dealing with this. We are building some momentum on this globally; it’s great to have support from New Zealand of course, after the horrific events they have experienced there. We are seeing a lot of interest from a lot of other G20 countries.

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible]

PRIME MINISTER: The penalties, well, this will all be outlined in the bill we’ll release and we are still working through some of those details. But, those penalties the Attorney General will also speak to, it will be expressed as a percentage of the turnover of the company. Now when you look at the billions and billions and billions that these companies rake in from their platforms, we’re talking very serious penalties.

JOURNALIST: How many schools have taken you up on your offer for more security, religious schools that is, and why?

PRIME MINISTER: Sadly, it has always been the case for religious schools - particularly Jewish schools I must say, who have raised this issue with me regularly - that they have needed that security. They have already been putting it in, out of their own pocket. That’s one of the many reasons why I decided to upgrade the security package for all schools, not just for Jewish schools, but also for Islamic schools and any other faith-based schools, or any schools for that matter that have that need to ensure their children are kept safe. Because these are places of - as they describe it - mass gathering; for people of different faiths. It’s important that where we have a society where these threats are present, the Government has a responsibility to keep Australians safe. Now that addition package was only announced a few weeks ago, but I do know there are already standing applications and interest from religious schools all around the country. So that money will be going out where it’s needed.

JOURNALIST: And the extra money for the AFP, is that in response to some concern that perhaps, we let the terrorist slip through the net?

PRIME MINISTER: No, no. What this is a recognition of is the growing threat of extremist terrorism in so many different forms. As I said, eight times the number of people we have got under surveillance now, than we had five years ago. This funding is in response, sadly, to the demand that is there. It is also doing things with new threats, which can occur around drone attacks and being able to counter that. There is also funding going into cyber-terrorism as well and countering those threats to Australia. There is money going into the intelligence-gathering activities of ASIO. With the AFP, it’s everything from protection surveillance – remember that our agencies thwarted 15 terrorist attacks in Australia, that’s what our agencies have done. We want to make sure that they continue to have the resources they need to do that job and keep Australians safe. This is core business for the Government, it always has been. It’s our Government doing what our Government has always done; that is ensuring that our security agencies have the resources they need.

Under the previous Labor government they withered, they were allowed to wither. Our Government has restored funding to security agencies and Defence forces, so they’re equipped to do the job all Australians ask of them.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister what do you make of Eddie McGuire's comments last night about Cynthia Banham?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I understand that Eddie has withdrawn the comments and has apologised for them. I haven't personally seen the comments that Eddie made, but if that’s what he has done, I'm sure that’s the appropriate thing to do.

JOURNALIST: But in the past, he has made a series of offensive comments about a female journalist. Should he have this platform when he is offending a lot of people? Hurting people in the community?

PRIME MINISTER: Everybody is responsible for everything they say and do. He needs to take responsibility for what he says and does.

JOURNALIST: Could I put a question to the Minister? There’s about three weeks left for farmers in western New South Wales to get a winter crop in. A lot of people are looking at the third failed winter crop in as many years, and there is talk [inaudible] can we expect more drought relief in the Budget?

MINISTER FOR REGIONAL SERVICES, SPORT, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND DECENTRALISATION: Well the $7 billion that our Government has put forward from a federal perspective is to support drought-stricken farmers and more broadly their community and the industry as a whole. That has been very well conducted. I have just come back from Gunnedah actually overnight. I have been out there at Moree and on the ground in Narrabri, talking to producers about these issues. They are very much looking forward to some much-needed rain but the drought seems to be continuous. Our government has made it very, very clear that we will continue to provide the support that not only our farmers need, but importantly also those regional communities and service industries that support the farming sector. We’re making sure that when it does rain, as it will, that those service industries are there to be able to assist our farmers to remain productive.

[Interruption]

Great, bravo! That’s why last week I was able to announce an additional 15 local government areas that will be recipients of our Drought Communities Funding. That’s the $1 million to those local communities to assist projects and Councils, to assist [inaudible]. We know the recovery will take a long time and we’ve made it clear that we’re prepared to stand with our farmers and communities until the job is done.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister under the Opposition’s negative gearing plan, sorry, under the new plan, negative gearing will apply to new constructions. How is that going to affect supply?

PRIME MINISTER: When you increase taxes on housing and when this person goes and buys a new property, they can't sell it to an investor. So the pool of people you can sell your property to is smaller, which means it’s worth less. The Labor Party doesn't understand how the housing market works. SQM Research has already shown that it could result in rents increasing, in Queensland for example, by more than 20 per cent. So Labor's housing taxes will increase rents, undermine the value of everybody's home whether you’re an investor or a first-time buyer, and undermine confidence in the economy by putting at risk the housing market, which is so important to the fundamental confidence that consumers have in our economy. It is a sledgehammer of a policy that is reckless and it sucks the aspiration from Australians who are just working hard and trying to get ahead.

See, next week's Budget is going to be backing in people working hard, trying to do the right thing for their families and for their communities. People who are having a go will get a fair go under the Budget that we will hand down next week. This is a Budget for Australians who aspire to keep doing better and think big things about our country and their part in it, just by going to work every day, raising their families, keeping their communities together.

Our Budget next week is there to back them in so they can keep doing that, so we can make Australia as strong as it can be. I want people to keep more of what they earn, because it’s hard work earning it. When they can keep more of what they earn, they can do more for their families and do more for their communities, which is what makes Australia stronger.

JOURNALIST: On the social media laws, what do you say to claims you’re trying to rush them through before the election?

PRIME MINISTER: I think it’s urgent that we should do it. I don't think we should delay, I think this is exactly what we should be doing. Why would we delay it? It’s incredibly important we take the action now to deal with social media companies and make sure they’re in no doubt that if they don't get their act together on this, they will face the stiffest penalties imaginable. So, I’m not kidding with them, I got them all together in Brisbane last week. I gave them a hearing, they know what they need to do. We are establishing a task force between the social media companies, the technology experts, our experts sitting with our key intelligence and other security agencies, to make sure that they can get their programs in place and be doing the right thing. That’s the work they need to do. If they fail to do that work, if they fail to provide the protections, then I will ensure there is a legal framework in place, that the laws are there to catch those who are not going to live up to their responsibilities. So, it is a very strong message and we’re not mucking around and we’re very direct with them. They have the technology and I would only hope that they would follow through on the intent they indicated to me the other day.

But we’ll see. If they fail, I can assure you there will be laws in place to deal with those who aren’t going to stump up.

JOURNALIST: Won’t that be rushed though, without the proper oversight of a Senate Committee or further consultation?

PRIME MINISTER: This is not a particularly complicated matter and it builds off the laws that we already have in relation to child pornography, so it leverages those laws and the Attorney General will talk about those over the course of today. These are straightforward laws, they’re not difficult, it’s not hard to hold people to account. I don't think we should delay, I think we should get on with it and I’d look forward – once we’ve taken the bill through our Party Room and consulted with the Opposition – I’d hope we’d be able to tidy this up in a few days.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what do you make of Brunei and their new laws where gay people can be stoned to death coming in very soon?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I’ll let the Foreign Minister speak about it, she’s been working on this.

FOREIGN MINISTER: Thanks Prime Minister, if I may also add on the matter of the legislation concerning social media platforms, I’ve been consulting and speaking with a number of international counterparts in the region and beyond. Just yesterday I sat down with our counterparts from Singapore here in Sydney for our Singapore-Australia Joint Ministerial Council and it’s fair to say that following the events in Christchurch there is very significant and widespread concern about what was enabled through social media platforms, to be streamed live in those circumstances. I can’t imagine for a moment what excuse there would be for a government delaying the enactment of laws such as this. In fact, I’d suggest that advocating a delay of these laws would in fact be irresponsible, given what we’ve seen in recent weeks, tragically, in New Zealand.

In relation to Brunei, we understand that as has been mooted for some time now, the Brunei government intends to introduce Sharia law as it’s national law. This is an issue which the Government through my predecessor and I have taken up with the government of Brunei. We are strong supporters of human rights right across this region and more broadly, including in Brunei. We are absolute opponents of the death penalty in all circumstances, so any suggestion that laws would facilitate the application of the death penalty is a matter of concern to Australia. These are communications we will continue to have with our counterparts, I conveyed our views as recently, again, as last week to Erywan, to the Foreign Minister of Brunei and we will continue to do so. They are matters of some human rights concern.

PRIME MINISTER: Just while on the issue of foreign policy, I made a comment that was reported in the Australian today. The Greens have a policy to walk away from the US Alliance. Now, there has been no more significant factor in Australia’s strategic defence arrangements and security arrangements, than our Alliance with the United States. Now, that Alliance of course has had bipartisan support, as you’d expect it to. But what I find troubling is that the Labor Party would preference the Greens - who wish to abolish the US Alliance – over the Liberal Party who has stood forthright for that Alliance. Now there are plenty of other extremist policies of the Greens that people are very well aware of; they want to introduce death taxes for example, they want to completely abolish our border protection regime. So, it beggars belief that the Labor Party could be taken seriously on issues of national security when they’re going to preference the Greens ahead of the Liberal Party at the next election. Now the Labor Party has set out the standard on these things, when it comes to determining matters of preferences. So here’s the test for Bill Shorten; if you’re serious about national security and keeping Australians safe, do not preference the Greens ahead of the Liberal Party. Do the right thing and ensure that a Party that has always stood for the Alliance and Australia’s national security, and keeping Australians safe, would receive a higher preference from the Labor Party than the Greens.

To do otherwise would be to have an equivalence between the Greens and the Labor Party, which I think many Australians have long suspected.

So the ball is in your court, Bill. You tell us what you really think about national security and we’ll know your answer by where you preference the Greens and the Liberal Party at the next election.

Okay, thanks very much.


Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison pays tribute outside the Al-Noor Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, 29 March 2019.
DOORSTOP, CHRISTCHURCH

New Zealand's National Remembrance Service following Christchurch terrorist attack
PRIME MINISTER: It’s been a great privilege to be here today with Jenny, the Governor General and Lady Cosgrove and Bill and Chloe Shorten, to stand together as Australians. To stand with New Zealanders, to stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters here, the first responders and all those who have been so directly and more broadly impacted. The service today was a thing of absolute beauty.

Today, New Zealand has responded to hate with love. They've responded to violence with peace, and I think that is a very, very powerful message. The outpouring that we saw today and as we've seen over the last fortnight - from New Zealanders, from Australians, from all around the world - I think has been a reminder of the goodness amongst the darkness that is often present.

I suppose one of the most touching moments today was when Farid Ahmed spoke as someone who is a survivor of that horrendous attack, that terrorist attack. He spoke of love and he spoke of peace and he spoke of forgiveness. These are very powerful, powerful things. Far more powerful than the hate and the violence that he encountered on that horrible day.

To hear the names of the 50 souls that were lost, particularly the last name spoken by his daughter, was overwhelming, overwhelming. But out of this comes a great hope and that's been expressed, I think, so beautifully by the people of New Zealand in the only way they know how to; with a smile, with a beautiful Maori song and a sense of strength which Christchurch and New Zealand has responded to that call for kia kaha by doing exactly that, by staying strong. For that, we embrace our Kiwi brothers and sisters, our cousins and we stand with them, as we always will. I'm also very grateful to the appreciations of support from New Zealand for the great work that Australians have been doing here, both in the police work that is being undertaken, the other support which is coming again in this next week - I understand New South Wales Ambulance counsellors will be here in New Zealand, providing support.

Whether it's state or federal - it was great to see the Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, here today - no Kiwi will ever forget the silver fern on the Opera House. I think that was such a wonderful gesture and I want to thank Premier Berejiklian for arranging that so quickly, to send that message on behalf of all Australians.

Today I had the privilege and the opportunity to talk to survivors directly, to talk to first responders directly. The shift that turned up on that horrible day two weeks ago, was the same shift that turned up to the Christchurch earthquake. So you can only imagine what those first responders were going through, as the horrors of the Christchurch earthquake, were now confronted with the horrors of violent terrorism in their midst. So it has been a deeply moving day for Jenny and I. There is much work to do. I've just finished a bilateral with the Prime Minister, where I have commended her for the work that she has done and the leadership she's shown here in New Zealand. We have worked very closely over the last few weeks, whether it was on gun laws or whether it was on the immediate response and the support that was provided. And now working together - and I appreciate her strong support for the G20 initiative, taking forward these measures on social media - as you know, we're working very consistently on that path. We appreciate their support and equally New Zealand is working on this as well. We'll continue to form a strong team, a strong ANZAC team, when it comes to pursuing these issues globally as well as domestically.

For Australia, while this didn't happen on our own shores, it certainly felt like it did, because of the closeness of our two countries. All those years ago, when John Howard responded to Port Arthur and the response for us today is to ensure that social media is not weaponized, in the same way that guns were available in Australia all those years ago and are no longer, thanks to that important reform. So a very somber day, but amongst the darkness there was a bright stream of light today.

JOURNALIST: PM do you get the sense at all, I mean in your time here, about the fact that Australia is viewed at the centre of all this and the ramification that might have on our relationship? The very [inaudible] between the two peoples?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't believe it does and I don't believe it will. The bonds between Australians and New Zealanders are too strong and too deep. So no, I don't believe it will. I think there is a way that we have shared this pain together that I think conveys an empathy and understanding that all Kiwis understand.

JOURNALIST: Is there a sense of guilt, a sense of responsibility [inaudible] given that the [inaudible] Australian citizen?

PRIME MINISTER: The crime was perpetrated by an extremist terrorist and extremist terrorists have no nationality. Their only nationality is hate and violence. That's not our country and it's not New Zealand either. So we proclaimed to the world that here, where we all live, we stand for peace, we stand for tolerance, we stand for living together in a harmony that frankly, the rest of the world, I know, would want to emulate. Australia and New Zealand are the most successful immigration countries and multicultural countries in the world. Australia, in particular, is a standout success on that front. I think that is the face of Australia.

JOURNALIST: Did you discuss bilateral efforts to combat right wing extremism and terrorism with Prime Minister Ardern and if so, what were the outcomes?

PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to go into the details of the bilateral on a day like today. We work closely on those matters and all matters, particularly our focus at the moment is working very much on ensuring that we have coordinated action in relation to social media reforms.

JOURNALIST: Was there a discussion about whether Jacinda Ardern would like the alleged perpetrator extradited to Australia?

PRIME MINISTER: There was no discussion of that and there's no planning on that basis.

JOURNALIST: So no [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

JOURNALIST: Australia and New Zealand of course now share a tragedy, for us Port Arthur for them Christchurch, does it disturb you that conspiracy theories about Australia's own tragedy are now finding purchase 20 years on?

PRIME MINISTER: Look I've commented on those matters already in Australia, I don't intend to give that any oxygen in this city.

JOURNALIST: When you spoke with survivors, what did they tell you?

PRIME MINISTER: They are getting through, every day, but the one thing they did say to me was, they were so aware of the love and support that had come. Not just here in Christchurch and around New Zealand, but from Australia and all around the world. They felt quite overwhelmed with the expressions of support and love that have come from everywhere. That's why I say love conquers hate, peace conquers violence and that is what is happening in Christchurch.

JOURNALIST: You spoke of the little girl who read her father's name. You, as a dad, is that why it hit home so much?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, of course, of course. This is … this is a shocking terrorist event that will touch each of us differently and so for me as a father, hearing a daughter say the name of her father, who she now can't kiss goodnight ever again, obviously impacts me as a father. Jenny was talking to mothers today, she was talking to other women today. We will all connect with this in different ways, but in doing that, I think we all connect to each other.

Today is a day to celebrate the strength of humanity, the strength of love, the strength of peace and our shared commitment to it, as two great nations. Two great nations who have fought for peace all of our existence and we'll stand together in peace today.

Thank you very much.



DOORSTOP, PERTH WA

PRIME MINISTER: Good morning. Well overnight, in relation to the revelations of One Nation’s officials engaging in behaviour overseas which were putting at risk Australia’s gun laws, I made a very simple pitch, a very simply statement - to those who have voted for One Nation in the past and maybe considering doing it again - that the answers you're seeking to the legitimate questions that you're asking about issues like population management, rural and regional Australia, the need to deliver water infrastructure, the security of jobs and traditional industries in this country, whether it's in the mining industry, the agricultural sector, forestry. The answers to those questions you will not find in the One Nation party. You will find them in the Liberal and Nationals Parties. That's where my appeal to those Australians, good Australians with legitimate questions about the future of this country, my appeal to them is to come to the Liberal and National Parties because we have a track record of delivering on these issues and we will continue.

I also said earlier in the week that I found the behaviour of those officials particularly appalling and I have left it for a few days to see what the response of the One Nation leadership would be to those events and sadly I'm disappointed and I find the response to the action of those One Nation officials unsatisfactory. There have been further revelations overnight also which have led me to the position this morning having consulted with the Party organisation, I have been in touch directly with them today and overnight - because ultimately this is a decision for the Party organisation - but my recommendation to them which they're accepting is that One Nation will be put below the Labor Party at the next election by the Liberal Party. Now, this is a decision which is based on our strong view about the sanctity of Australia's gun laws and to ensure that at no stage that those things should ever be put at risk. And it's very important, having been the Party that introduced those laws, that we ensure that they are forever protected and there can be no compromise when it comes to those issues or any trading on the issue of those gun laws.

Now, I know there are many other issues that surround the One Nation party and that has been the topic of commentary for a long period of time. But when it comes to this matter, I haven't rushed into this decision in the same way that John Howard, who I have been consulting with closely on this matter, in the same way that he, indeed, did not rush into this decision when he took it 20 years ago, I have followed a similar considered process. I was waiting to see what their reaction would be to those events earlier in the week and I'm disappointed by that reaction.

So I say to those One Nation voters, those who have looked to One Nation in the past, you will not find the answers there and I think the events of this week demonstrate that once again. Looking for national security, looking for a stronger economy, looking to ensure that Australians work together and stay together to create a stronger nation, well, the answer is the Liberal and National Parties and we'll be putting ourselves forward in that same way as we do at every election and we'll be seeking their primary support as I said on Tuesday.

JOURNALIST: Have you spoken to Pauline Hanson in the past 24 hours and is there anything she can say today because she is holding a media conference? Anything she can say today to explain away her comments about Port Arthur?

PRIME MINISTER: That's for Pauline Hanson to say and do. It's been several days now and the actions of those One Nation officials and I made no comment about the actions of Pauline Hanson in relation to those issues at all. They were the behaviour of those One Nation officials. There's further revelations from these tapes, and I know that there is some commentary about the nature of that investigation and how it is done, I'm not making commentary on that either. But the comments particularly last night and the linkages to Port Arthur, I'm sure all Australians would be shocked about. I was shocked by them and, you know, these gun laws have kept Australia safe for 20 years and had led the world and it's one of the Liberal Party's most proud achievements together with the National Party. And when it comes to this issue, we cannot allow it to be compromised or sliced away. That's not something we can have.

JOURNALIST: So below Labor, but not below the Greens?

PRIME MINISTER: Well if the Labor Party wants to create some equivalence between the Labor Party and the Greens and suggest that they're somehow the same political movement, I'll let them explain that, that's the Labor Party. I mean, when it comes to how the ultimate tickets are determined, it's exactly as I said the other day, we have to wait til nominations close, there can be any number of parties. There's a lot of competition for who you put last from a lot of these parties. Frankly, I always found the Greens to be a real serious danger to Australia. The Greens have opposed us on almost every element of national security legislation we have put into this Parliament. They have actively worked against the safety of Australians. So I don't think there's any comfort in the Greens' position either. But if the Labor Party want to draw an equivalence between the Greens and Labor on dealing with this issue, well they can. And I think the people of Australia should know - if Bill Shorten thinks Labor and the Greens are the same, well, tell them, Bill.

JOURNALIST: So the Greens are more of a danger than a party that seems to believe that Port Arthur is a conspiracy theory?

PRIME MINISTER: All I'm saying there's a lot of parties who have a lot of extreme positions and I'm not goings to equate the Greens with one of the mainstream parties in this country which is the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Party. So I think we have made our position very clear on that.

JOURNALIST: Two One Nation officials, one of them is a Senator. Can and should Parliament pull him into line?

PRIME MINISTER: I know the Senate will be looking at a number of measures when they regather next week to deal not only with those issues, but also issues relating to Senator Anning and I'll leave that to my Senate colleagues to deal with those issue there in the Senate. But, you know, this is an issue and a decision I have not come to lightly, in the same way that John Howard didn't all those years ago. And this is a decision I have taken in concert with the Party organisation and discussing it with the Federal President, State President, particularly the Queensland LNP President, who I have had discussions with this morning. What the Nationals do is a matter for them, that's a separate issue. I'm speaking for the Liberal Party. Thank you very much.

JOURNALIST: Was the impact on the Liberal vote a consideration at all in some marginal seats where One Nation preferences do matter?

PRIME MINISTER: My primary focus is always to keep Australians safe. And to keep Australians safe, you need to keep your gun laws sacrosanct, and that's what I'm doing. Thank you.



LEADERSHIP MATTERS BREAKFAST - PERTH WA

PRIME MINISTER: Well thank you very much for that very kind introduction. I love being in Western Australia, I love being here in Perth. I always get such a warm welcome when I'm here. So many friends here from so many years of coming across to Western Australia. And there's something very special about today's gathering and I could make many acknowledgements this morning because there are so many great and good Western Australians who are here amongst us, including of course my colleagues led by Mathias Cormann. Of course, I want to acknowledge the traditional owners, Elders past and present and those emerging. I also want to acknowledge our servicemen and women who are in the room today and say simply to those who have served and veterans, thank you for your service. There's a very proud history of service here in Western Australia.

But a person I want to acknowledge this morning is Kerry Stokes. This event, this vision - I'm going to talk to you about my vision today, but the vision that you’ve seen realised through Kerry here at the Seven West Telethon is something truly remarkable. $37 million raised in the last event alone. More than 40 incredibly worthy and amazing organisations have been the beneficiary of this tremendous initiative. And what I really like about this initiative is it isn't Seven West is writing out the cheque, it’s Seven West harnessing the goodwill of Western Australians for each other. That's what's happening here at this event, that's why I think it's such a great thing. Yes, it's generous. Yes, it's impactful because I know Richard Goyder who leads the charge on this understands and manages that process incredibly well. But its great beauty is how it harnesses the passion and empathy of Western Australians and people around the country to support these incredible causes. So if can you join me in thanking Kerry Stokes.

[Applause]

A fair go for those who have a go. You’ve probably heard me say that before. That’s why I like Western Australia. Because here in Western Australia, there is no better example of that way of doing things. That expectation of every single resident of this incredible state. And I believe this is a fundamentally Australian value. A fair go for those who have a go. Fairness isn't just about everybody gets the same. We didn't build this country on that principle. We built it on a very different principle that you have to show up. That you have to make an effort. That you have responsibility for yourself. But also to extend that to those around you. This notion of responsibility as the trigger, the entry if you like. Being able to benefit from this country's great opportunities, I think, is a fundamental principle. And I particularly think about it when I think of the migrants who've come from all over the world. Unless we’re Indigenous, like Ken, then we have all come from somewhere else at some point in time. And people have come to this country for this very principle - a fair go for those who have a go. And our migrant history of this country is one of our migrant communities doing exactly that. That's what they were hoping for. That's what they were looking for. To make a contribution, not to take one. And that's what a fair go for those who have a go means. And that's why it is the fundamental principle that sits underneath every single plan, every single policy, that me and my team, my Liberal National team, are implementing now as we have over the last five and a half years and seek to continue to implement into the future.

Now this principle of a fair go for those who have go was deeply violated by the way GST was being distributed in this country. The decisions I took as Treasurer to take action on this was not borne out of any sort of sentiment or, you know, sweet beliefs about Western Australia or how lovely you all are - of course that’s the case. But it wasn't about that. It was about ensuring that the way that the GST was distributed was distributed on the principle of a fair go for those who have a go. And this is the ‘have a go’ state. And the ‘have a go’ state was not getting a fair deal and that needed to change. And that was the point being made by The West Australian. And they gave me quite a good stick, I've got to tell you, when I became Treasurer. Just like Steve Irons, who was my flatmate in Canberra who would give me quite a bit of stick on this issue every single day, as a proud Western Australian. And I remember the day after I resolved in my own mind, and working within the senior levels of government, that this was something we had to fix. That it could not be kicked down the road any longer, that we had to take it head on, and we had to deal with is, and it would not be easy. And I want to thank Seven West because they had rightly been advocating on this issue. They have rightly been championing this issue, just like so many of my colleagues here in Western Australia have. Whether it was Christian Porter, who as a state treasurer here was also such a strong advocate, and all of my team. But The West Australian, they led the charge and so I remember the meeting I had. And I said, “Look, you better be rough with me. But I want to know one answer to one question when we sat down. Do you want to fix this, or do you just want a campaign?” And you won't be surprised that the answer from Seven West is no, we want to fix it. We want to see this fixed. That's why we’re in this. And so I said, “Look, this isn't going to be easy. An eastern state Treasurer who has got to go and convince not only everybody back on the other side of the country, but we have to work out how we can actually achieve this.” And I said this is going to take you some time. And so you need to give me some room and some space to go and get a solution and get people on board for the switch. And I want to thank Seven West and The West Australian for giving me that time. Because without that time, then I think it would have been very difficult to achieve and I think what that shows is the pragmatic advocacy that was brought to this issue in the public arena from The West.

So I think people understood here that the argument was never going to be won on some parochial argument. It had to be won on its merits, and the merits were that the principle of a fair go for those who have a go was not operating. Now, I'm pleased to say it is operating now because together we've with Mathias and the whole team, we have legislated this. That deal is done. It's locked, it’s in by none less than the Governor-General of Australia. To give security to Western Australians about their access to that fair share forever. And of all the things that I think they've been able to achieve here in Western Australia, I think this is a very significant moment. Not just because of how it enables Western Australia to be able to guarantee the essential services that Western Australians rely on. But I think it says something very clearly on behalf of my government to Western Australians - when I say I'm going to do something, I will do it. I won't lead people along. I won't give them false promises. But if I say I'm going to do it, you better look at out, because I’m going to. Whether it's on stopping the boats. Whether it's on reforming our welfare system, getting the Budget back into balance. Reforming the GST, the first of its kind since Federation began. If I set my mind on that and I believe that is in the country's interests, wild horses will not drag me away from achieving that goal. I'm often criticised for being a little too hard-headed on these things. But I'll tell you what, problems require some hard-headedness sometimes to be able to crash through. All of the naysayers and all of those who think it can't be achieved. But this why I like Western Australia, because you get this. You get this notion of vision, you get this notion of achievement.

So let me tell you in 10 quick points what is that plan for a stronger economy for Australia. It's the plan we've been delivering. A plan that has delivered more than one and a quarter million jobs in the last five and a half years. That has reduced unemployment down to the lowest level in a very long time. It now has a 4 in front of it, 4.9 per cent. And I know things in Western Australia are still on their way back. It is a plan that has already ensured that the proportion of Australians of working age in this country who have a job is at the highest level in our history. That's right, higher than what it was under the Howard/Costello government. It is now at the highest level. That our welfare dependence of the working age population is at its lowest level in more than 30 years. That our expenditure is under control. The lowest level of spending growth of a federal government in more than 50 years. This plan is based on ensuring, of course, that the government lives within its means and next week we will hand down the first Budget surplus in 12 years. 12 years. Why is that so important? Well, if you vote Labor once, you will pay for it for more than a decade. In 2007, going into that election, the government had a $20 billion dollar surplus and there was $40 billion dollars in the bank. Labor reversed that in the space of a year. And then they just kept going. And it has taken us more than 10 years for a Treasurer to stand at the despatch box again, as Josh Frydenberg will do with Mathias’ support next Tuesday night and announce a surplus. And that comes from just the sheer determination and will to get expenditure under control. To put in place the measures that drive your economy forward. And just the sheer everyday competent discipline of running a responsible government.

So next Tuesday will be a very important day, because it's the day we got back. It's the day Australia got back to where the Howard government left us and it's taken us more than a decade to achieve it. And so no one should be under any mistake that if you vote Labor in this next election, you're voting for a decade and more of economic hardship and difficulty, setting the nation on the wrong course for our economy. Lower taxes is part of our plan. And it's not just a promise because we've legislated. $144 billion worth of personal income tax relief right across the board, I stress. See, our view on taxes is you don't have to tax some people more to tax other people less. I think that violates the fair go principle for those who have a go. I don't buy into the politics of envy. I am a fully signed up member on the politics of aspiration and the economics of aspiration, which I think Western Australians understand. Lower taxes is about ensuring that when you earn more, you keep more of what you want. And I want Australians to earn more and that will come from a stronger economy, not some magic wand in the union movement or a Labor prime minister who thinks he can wave his magic wand and all of a sudden everybody's wages go up. That is a cruel hoax and it is a cruel thing to say to Australians, because that policy he is speaking about will cost other Australians their jobs. Someone always suffers under Labor for them to do something for someone else. Not under our government.

Under our government, we want tax relief for all Australians. We want tax relief by backing small and family and medium sized businesses. Whether it's been our plan to reduce the payment terms for small businesses down from over 30 days down to 20 days which comes in place on the 1st of July of this year. Where there's the small business tax relief, the instant asset write-off which we have raised to 25,000 for companies up to $10 million. Whether it's the investments we're making in the small business loan securitisation fund so small businesses can get access to capital. Ensuring affordable and reliable energy. Now, in Western Australia that’s a more achievable goal because of the sensible arrangements that you have here, particularly in relation to gas. But for all of Australia to do better, including Western Australia, then all of Australia has to do better. And that means having sensible energy policies for both households and businesses. And just this week, we've announced a series of initiatives to ensure that we're getting, in the east coast, some 4,000 megawatt capacity additions to the market through the underwriting proposal that is being put forward to us by the ACCC which we've adopted. And that comes on top of our series of investments that will see our emissions reduction targets achieved, while not costing us our economy. Investing in hydro and other important energy sources that will provide reliability and sustainability for the future and keep electricity prices down. Get them down, keep the lights on while at the same time meeting our emissions reduction targets.

Building the transport and technology infrastructure Australia needs in the future. Now today I'll be joined by Mathias and many others from my team. We'll be announcing $1.6 billion additional, which will be in next week's Budget, for an investment in Australian infrastructure here in the West. Now, we have already been big investors here but this will be on roads of strategic importance. Projects like the Tonkin Highway. Projects like METRONET. All of these things which are designed for Australians, frankly, to get home sooner and safer, or to work sooner and safer and people can get out of the traffic and onto the site. These are practical projects. Our congestion busting projects. We've currently got a rolling program of infrastructure investment around the country, some $75 billion dollars, and that continues into the future. We've got to drive all of our industries forward, all of them. Sure, the bright shiny new ones, they’re tremendous. The exciting innovation that’s taking place there [inaudible] in the medical instruments industry and the health industry. This is fantastic, but we want agriculture to go forward. We want mining to go forward. We want forestry to go forward. We want our traditional industries to continue to go forward. We need all our industries to continue and a diversity in our industries. And so no, we won’t embrace policies like the Labor Party will with their 45 per cent emissions reduction target which will wipe out aluminium smelters in this country and hit industry. We won’t do that. Or increasing the costs of agricultural production and to this day, I can tell you tonne by tonne where we will be meeting our emissions reduction targets. Our opponents still, after all these years, cannot answer the most basic questions. Will you use the carry over targets from Kyoto? Will you use taxpayers’ money to buy foreign carbon credits as part of your emissions reduction costs? What’s the overall emissions abasement budget you have to meet? Is it 1.1 billion tonnes or 1.4 billion tonnes? I can tell you what ours is, it’s 328 million tonnes and we have a plan to meet all of that over the next 10 years. The reckless targets of an emissions reduction target of 45 percent will shut down industries and it will and shutdown jobs and particularly the cuts here in WA.

We need to ensure Australians of all generations have the skills they need. I'm frustrated as I'm sure many of you are, that our current schools arrangements delivered across the country are not hitting the mark. And you know it's not about just money. You can chuck more money down the funnel and just see it go to the same place it's going now. We need to rethink how we're achieving things in the skills area across this country and that requires a closer collaboration about what is needed on the ground, on the shop floor, in the office, in the business and we'll have more to say about that.

I want to keep Australians working together. I hate this idea of setting one Australian against another. When I walk into the small and family businesses around the country, the thing I love hearing, “So how have you been here?” “I’ve been here about 12 years. 18 years, 7 years.” Men, women. Been to each others’ christenings and weddings. So has the boss. That's Australians working together in small and family businesses medium sized businesses around the country. They understand that it's an enterprise and you will do better by all working together. And the industrial conflict that Labor wants to bring to this country I think is very, very serious. I was down in Geelong the other day. And as I was announcing this project for fast rail between Melbourne and Geelong, there they were, standing behind me, chanting away – “union power, union power, union power”. Well that's what it's going to look like on your site, in your office, in your community. We don't want that. Australians want to work together. Australians want to get on together and we need to have an industrial system which doesn't try to set people against each other. Of course, we’ve got to keep big businesses accountable and pay the taxes. They need to keep investing in the future of the country. They need to ensure that they do the right thing by small and family businesses and those in agricultural sector and our competition laws need to protect against that. We’re seeing that in the banking and financial industry, certainly seeing it in the energy industry. We need to hold them to account and we will be, and we will continue to do that.

And we need to keep expanding our horizons with our export opportunities and our government has been so successful at this like none other before us, I believe. More opportunity into the future. That's what we want. More business opportunities because that means more jobs. It’s all about jobs. I’ll finish on this. It's all about jobs. Warren Mundine, as some of you may know, told me that when his grandfather got a job, it changed their family. And look at Warren now. A job changes a life. A job changes a family, a job changes a community and jobs change nations. You want to know what I’m about? Jobs. The thing I'm most proud of what our government has achieved is over one and a quarter million jobs for Australians. We've had record growth of jobs for young Australians, over 100,000 in one financial year, never achieved before. Those young people's lives are changed forever. You know, when I talk to businesses and they talk about employing young people, that's when their heart beats, that's when their chest pumps up. Because they know by running a good business, a competitive business, a business that's successful, they know they can employ people and change their lives.

So we're all in the same occupation here - creating jobs for Australians to create a stronger Australia. That's my plan. I will be seeking the support of all Australians to back, particularly here in Western Australia, so all Australians get a fair go for those who have a go. Thank you.



DOORSTOP, CARLISLE WA

Congestion busting projects; Federal Budget; One Nation
THE HON STEVE IRONS MP: Good morning we're at the Oats Street railway crossing in my electorate of Swan and the Prime Minister is back in Western Australia again and back in my electorate of Swan so, we're here to hear about the congestion busting announcement of $1.6 billion, so Prime Minister, over to you.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much Steve. It's great to be here with all of my colleagues from far and wide around Western Australia and it is an important and big day for Western Australia. Next week's Budget there'll be $1.6 billion worth of projects announced here for Western Australia that are doing things to really improve the lives of Western Australians. Whether it's right where we are here and we've got about five minutes before the bells ring again on this level crossing and these level crossings are things that infuriate people as they try to get around the city. And over $200 million being invested in getting rid of those level crossings alone here in Steve's electorate. And that's an important part about congestion busting projects, so people get home sooner and safer and people can get work.

But as far down as Bunbury and Albany and as well down in the electorate of Canning, where we've also invested in major projects, we have the big trucks on the road. These are big projects that ensure the continued growth of the Western Australian economy. This is an economy that is on its way back, that is powering back and that's its future. For its for its future to be secure, we need these significant infrastructure investments which are a key part of our national economic plan to create a stronger economy so we can deliver on the essential services, like a stronger Medicare. I mean, we have the highest rate of bulk billing today in Medicare in our history. Why is that being made possible? Because our Government has been managing a Budget and delivering a stronger economy. When you're delivering a stronger economy, you can make the investments like the ones we're talking about here today in the Budget next week. $1.6 billion to upgrade further major projects right here in Western Australia.

So it's an exciting day from that point of view for Western Australia. It's a good day for the national economy as well. Because when the Western Australian economy is surging ahead, so does the Australian national economy surge ahead and we're looking forward to that great contribution of the Western Australian economy in the years ahead so we will be able deliver on our one and a quarter million jobs pledge to all Australians and we want to see so many of those jobs created right here in Western Australia. I'm going to ask Mathias to go through some of the projects, because as always, as Finance Minister - and he and I did quite a few Budgets together - but Mathias has been working closely with the Western Australian State Government here to deliver on these packages. Now, whether it's here in Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, wherever I might be. I am going to work with every state government to deliver on these projects and I want to commend Mathias for the work that he's done working with our local members here, Andrew Hastie particularly in the electorate of Canning on the projects we’re announcing today as well as Steve Irons. Because when you work together with the state government, you just get this stuff done. So well done again Mathias on making sure that we can bring the two levels of government here together to deliver on these important projects for Western Australia and our national economy.

SENATOR THE HON MATHIAS CORMANN, MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE: Thank you very much Prime Minister. It is great to have our Prime Minister Scott Morrison back here in the West and we welcome him here together with my WA Liberal Party colleagues. Today we are announcing another $1.6 billion federal investment into key infrastructure across Perth and across Western Australia. It is an investment in key congestion busting infrastructure, economy growing infrastructure, infrastructure to create more jobs, but most importantly infrastructure to help ensure that people across Perth and Western Australia can get home faster and safer at the end of the days work. Now another $1.6 billion federal investment announced today, which comes on top of $4.8 billion in additional federal investment into WA infrastructure over the last two years and nearly $10 billion in additional federal investment since we were elected to Government in September 2013. The Prime Minister is quite right, we have been working together with the State Government here in Western Australia, both the previous Liberal-National Government, but also this current McGowan Labor State Government, to ensure that we deliver the best possible outcome for the people here in Western Australia. That is what people expect us to do. Whether it is investing in level crossing removals, $207.5 million to remove level crossings here, which force people to wait instead of being able to get home or whether it is investing in regional infrastructure. Albany Ring Road, Karratha Tom Price Road, Bunbury Outer Ring Road, you name it, the Tonkin Highway expansion project. These are all important projects, which will bust congestion, which will help grow our economy, create more jobs and most importantly help families around Australia get home safely and faster. Thank you.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you. Let's take some questions on the particular announcements and obviously happy to take questions on other matters as well after that.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, your announcement about One Nation this morning…

PRIME MINISTER: Let’s deal with infrastructure first, happy to come back to those.

JOURNALIST: Is this just a reflection you’ve got several seats in WA that you’re worried about holding on to?

PRIME MINISTER: It's a reflection of the fact that Western Australia needs this investment in infrastructure and that's what we're doing. Let me take you through them, one at a time. $535 million under the Roads of Strategic Importance Initiative. That's in addition to $220 million already announced. A further $348.5 million towards three key projects on the Tonkin Highway, taking up government's total commitment to $929 million to these projects. That will complete the Tonkin Highway interchanges, the Tonkin Highway gap and the Tonkin Highway Stage 3 extension. $207.5 million for the removal of these level crossings here, three of them as Steve has pointed out. We have $140 million for constructions of stage 2 and 3 of the Albany ring road. A further $122 million to construct the remaining stages of the Bunbury outer ring road, bringing our total Government's commitment this project to $682 million. $115 million for the Fremantle traffic bridge at Swan River crossing and a further $10 million towards intersection improvements at the Thomas Road and Nicholson Road under the urban congestion funds and this builds on $96 million towards five congestion busting projects that I announced here in Perth on the 8th of March. So that's why we're investing it - because the economy needs it.

SENATOR THE HON MATHIAS CORMANN, MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE: Let me just say, your suggestion implies that this is the first time that we have done this. We have actually done this every single year. WA Liberal Members and Senators work together with their local communities to identify the priority projects that need Federal Government support and every single year we have fought for a fair share for WA to ensure we got the Federal Government investment into key infrastructure that we needed here, the same way as WA Liberal Members and Senators fought very hard to ensure that Western Australia got a fair share of the GST, which Scott Morrison as Treasurer delivered and which we legislated through the Parliament. We are not Johnny come latelies here. We have done this year in year out. We have fought hard for Western Australia year in year out and that is what we will do after the election if the people of Western Australia give us their confidence again.

PRIME MINISTER: Other questions on the projects today? Well, I’m glad I’ve comprehensively covered the interest. I know you’re excited, Nick, I know you're excited as a Western Australian. You're excited.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, does your decision on One Nation preferences make any difference if it's disregarded by the Queensland LNP as some have indicated?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it might be disregarded by the Queensland LNP. The Liberal Party and the Liberal Party members and seats that are in the LNP framework in Queensland. This is the position that the Liberal Party will be following. What the National Party does is a matter for them. These aren't decisions taken by governments, the distribution of preferences. They’re decisions taken by political parties and the National Party and the Liberal Party, we're separate parties. And so we will make our decisions independently of each other on these issues. The Liberal Party and those seats under the LNP framework in Queensland, which are the domain of the Liberal Party, this is the position that will be adopted in those seats.

JOURNALIST: Your tough stance this morning declaring Australia's gun laws are sacrosanct though was the reasoning for this decision. Should the government not be united on that, would you expect your Coalition partner to be united with you on that?

PRIME MINISTER: Again, I'm not going to make decisions for the Nationals. They will make their own decisions. They are they are an independent political party. And political parties make the decisions about preferences, not governments. But I would say, talking about gun laws, let's not forget it was the Labor Party that did a deal in New South Wales just last weekend with the Shooters Party. So, read into that what you will

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there are a lot… I suppose youth unemployment in this state. It's in double digits particularly between the day before 24 years old. A lot of people do want a job. What's your message for young voters and are there any commitments in this election for young voters?

PRIME MINISTER: My message to young people in Western Australia who want work is to vote Liberal. That's my message to them, because our government has the track record of delivering jobs. And the Western Australian economy has been under the pump. It's gone through a very difficult time, but the Western Australian economy is on the way back and jobs will not be created in Western Australia by a Labor Party that wants to drag the economy down with $200 billion dollars in higher taxes that will only make it harder for small business to employ people. I mean, the Labor Party is pursuing an industrial relations policy at the moment which is going to force small and family businesses to sack workers to pay others. And the biggest victims of Labor's policy will be young people. They’ll be the casualties. The ones who want extra hours, the ones that want their first job. These young people will be the first victims of Labor's recklessness when it comes to economic management. So young people wanting jobs in Western Australia - the Liberal Party is the answer to your question.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you made some comments earlier about a Budget surplus for 2018-19.

PRIME MINISTER: 2019-20.

JOURNALIST: 2019-20 sorry. So there won’t be a Budget surplus in 2018-19?

PRIME MINISTER: The Budget is next week. All the financial details will be revealed in the Budget. I'm saying very clearly as I have now for the months and months that this will be the first Budget surplus handed down next week by Josh Frydenberg, with the great assistance of the Finance Minister since the Liberals were last in power in 2007-08. So it's have been a 12 year wait to get the Budget back into balance. You vote Labor once, you pay for it for a decade. And now is not the time, having achieved that, to hand over the wheel of economic management to the Labor Party and Bill Shorten when it comes the economy who don't know how to drive.

JOURNALIST: Is that budget forecast surplus?

PRIME MINISTER: I’m talking about the Budget surplus we will hand down the 2019-20 on the 2nd of April which is next Tuesday.

SENATOR THE HON MATHIAS CORMANN, MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE: Sorry, when you just talk about forecasts, let me just say, contrary to the Labor Party, where every final Budget outcome that they delivered was worse than their forecast, if you look at our performance, the actual Budget outcome, the final Budget outcome, both in 2017-18 and 2016-17 was materially better than forecast. Last year by more than $19 billion better than forecast. When we deliver a Budget people can actually trust that we know what we are doing, whereas the Labor Party always hoped for the best and delivered the worst.

PRIME MINISTER: And that's why the Triple A credit rating previously had been under so much risk because Labor's estimates of their budget and their forecasts proved to be so hopelessly wrong. I mean, Western Australians would have a good idea of this. Wayne Swan put in the budget an iron ore price of $150 a tonne. And he assumed it forever. I mean, that was just sheer recklessness. He then went and spent the money that was never there and then got surprised that he delivered a massive deficit. So that's how the Labor Party runs budgets. How we run budgets, and particularly how I as a Treasurer ran budgets, was to over perform every single time.

JOURNALIST: Is that surplus tangibly real if it's a forecast? How can you guarantee it?

PRIME MINISTER: Because on every single Budget I delivered, on the final budget outcome, I bettered it. That's our record, because Australians know that the Liberals know how to manage money and they know the Labor Party don't know how to manage money and our form in government and Labor's form in government speaks very plainly.

JOURNALIST: Does this mean you’ve got more money to spend on election promises, including perhaps tax cuts?

PRIME MINISTER: Every opportunity I get I want Australians to be able to keep more of what they earn. That's always been my view and it's not just been an opinion, it's been legislation. In the budgets that I've handed down, we handed down the biggest reforms to our tax system that we've seen since the GST. I mean, $144 billion worth of tax relief legislated for all taxpayers, not just some. See, the Labor Party thinks to make some better off, you’ve got to make some worse off. That’s the Labor Party economic plan, the politics of envy. Our Budget will be a Budget of aspiration, Budget for people who are going to be going to continue to work hard and I want them to be able to keep more of their hard earned.

JOURNALIST: Will the debt be significantly higher because of the new accounting standards, including the operational [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: All of the financial metrics will be set out in the Budget and that's next Tuesday. It's not too many more sleeps and I'm sure you'll be able to wait.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you’ve come here promising a fair bit of money today obviously. Will this be it for major WA projects or will there be more during the election campaign?

PRIME MINISTER: It's not a promise, I should say. This is $1.6 billion. That is in the Budget. So it is in the Budget. It's not perhaps it will be done - this is in the Budget

SENATOR THE HON MATHIAS CORMANN, MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE: And without increasing taxes.

PRIME MINISTER: That is a very good point Mathias. Every time you see Bill Shorten's lips moving about spending money, understand that he's also increasing taxes at the same time. That's how Bill Shorten's plan works. Tax, spend. Tax, spend. That's Bill Shorten's plan. That's not our plan. Our plan is lower tax, drive the economy forward. That's how you guarantee essential services like Medicare. What's the proof of that? Medicare bulk billing is at the highest level on record because of the strong economic management of our government.

JOURNALIST:  Will there be more to come here in WA though?

PRIME MINISTER: Well there's a whole election campaign to come and beyond the Budget and I'll look forward to coming back from Western Australia on many occasions.

JOURNALIST: Pauline Hanson's press conference is [inaudible].

PRIME MINISTER: I have just announced, in a bipartisan way, and I think our fight against domestic violence must be bipartisan. And I believe it is. And I always seek to ensure that we pursue it in a very bipartisan way. We've put $328 million into the Fourth National Action Plan to combat domestic violence, that is the single biggest package of funding ever for combating domestic violence. It is true, and I agree absolutely with the statement that violence against women begins with disrespect against women, something Malcolm Turnbull used to say. And I absolutely agree with that. And that's why it's so important that we build a culture of respect for women and children in our community. And that's what our domestic violence package is designed to deliver. And that's what we'll continue to live up to. But I would really hope that matters like that would remain matters of a bipartisan commitment and not the subject of politicking.

JOURNALIST: Pauline Hanson's press conference today has been delayed an hour and counting. Does she need to front up to the Australian people about her Port Arthur comments and explain them.

JOURNALIST: Well I'm going to leave all of that to the leader of One Nation. That's what I'm going to do. Our Party has made its decision and when John Howard introduced those gun laws, as I said this morning, that was an act of absolute bravery. And it was done in partnership with the Nationals and Tim Fisher was also an incredibly brave politician. And they did it in lockstep. And we remain today in lockstep on the issue of gun laws. These laws have protected Australian lives. I think Australian know where the Liberal Party and the Nationals stand when it comes to gun laws. Our stand has been consistent ever since John Howard introduced those laws and we will never entertain anything or anyone that would seek to undermine those laws. Thank you all very much.



Q&A, LEADERSHIP MATTERS BREAKFAST

QUESTION: Haven’t seen much of you recently.

PRIME MINISTER: I was here two weeks ago. And go down and have a chat to the people at the Stirling Pool still the pool where I do my laps when I'm here. They were happy to see me again when I was down there last night. This is a place I'm a regular visitor to and have been over 20 years. I always love being here. Well I can understand why Bill Shorten might want to come here and try and explain to people why he tried to work against us getting a fairer deal for GST for W.A. Perhaps he's just got a lot more to explain to people over here in the West. But when it comes to our government, I think Western Australians know exactly who we are and exactly what we're about. And when we make a promise we deliver on it.

QUESTION: Bob Menzies served as Prime Minister for six thousand, seven hundred and thirty-three days. Howard was four thousand, two hundred and eighty-two. Bob Hawke; three thousand two hundred and four and Malcolm Fraser; two thousand six hundred and seventy-five. Now if as many people think you call an election on May 11, and, if as many people think you could lose that, you will have been Prime Minister for two hundred and fifty-three days, which doesn't sound that great compared to Bob, Malcolm and John. But, compared to Earle Page; 19 days after the death of John Lyons, compared to Frank Forde, just a week after the death of John Curtin two hundred and fifty-three days sounds pretty good. The reason I thought I'd put this in context is because you've achieved quite a lot in two hundred and fifty-three days. So could you tell us what the highlight and also the lowlight has been of your Prime Ministership thus far?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I just sort of answered that question there. The most exciting thing I think for our government which I've been central to has been our job creation record. That's the thing that floats my boat. That's what excites us as a government, is when we can create those jobs. Of course, there are many other initiatives that we've lead, particularly over these last six months. The privilege of leading the National Apology to the victims of institutional child sexual abuse was I'd have to say the most difficult day, but also the most important day. Those are the moments where Australians are expecting their Prime Minister to properly convey the deep sense of hurt and grievance and empathy. And I found it an incredibly humbling day as I sat and listened over several weeks and longer than that before. And I often think about that day and the people that I met. See the great privilege of doing this job is how many people and how many Australians you get to meet in so many different circumstances. And you get a window and a connection to Australian life that probably not many others really get to see. You see its greatness. You see its beauty in its people and you also see the things you need to address. So I love doing this job. It's the great privilege of my life. And the best players, whether it's in AFL or anything, they don't care how many games they've played, they care about how they play the game each and every day. I was talking to Paul Gallen the other day - I know it's Rugby League, so just give me a break - But Paul Gallen played 328 games for my beloved Sharks on the weekend. That is the all time club record. And I sent Paul a message before the game just congratulating him. And he sent me a text back saying "Thanks mate, I just want the win today." And that's how I approach every single day. Just doing the job with Australians that I have the privilege to do for Australians and to seek their mandate at the next election to keep doing that job for them.

 

QUESTION: You were going through a pretty ordinary trot for a while there with Cabinet resignations and what not. You seem to have a bit of your mojo coming back here, just pay homage to Kerry which is always a good thing to do and you talked about the GST which ticks a box for us over here as well. I've got to say, a few months ago when we heard that you were coming over, we were billing this as a farewell tour. But now, we think maybe this guy could be in for a win. We're not sure exactly -

PRIME MINISTER: I'm glad you've come round.

[Laughter and applause]

QUESTION: When you're looking at the polls and are constantly saying 'it's not going to happen', how do you keep positive, how do you keep punching on?

PRIME MINISTER: I think of the West Coast Eagles.

[Laughter and applause].

PRIME MINISTER: I was there. The Collingwood supporters were pretty cocky after that first term, that first quarter. But the boys had a great plan to get themselves back into that game and they didn't get distracted. They just kept their head down and they kept going. I'm sure there are plenty of fans in the stadium, supporters indeed, 'ah, this is done'. They didn't believe that. And I'm the same, and my team is the same. We know what our job is. We know what's at stake here. I'm not kidding when I say you vote Labor, you pay for it for more than a decade. The economy you will live in, your kids will live in, the business that you run, that someone may want to start, the school fees you might want to pay. That's all going to be determined by the economy you live in, in the next decade. And the decision that Australians will make at this next election will determine that environment. And this is very important because people express a lot of opinions on politics. They are even known to write it in the newspaper from time to time. But opinions are interesting but votes change the course of a nation and when people go to vote, they're not expressing opinion. They are actually taking part in what is going to set the economic climate for the next decade. And I think Australians know, and here in Western Australia you are on the way back with your economy. You're on the way back. And I would say to you at this time, more than ever, you do not want to hand the economic wheel to someone in Bill Shorten who does not know how to drive.

QUESTION: The subject of leadership is one [indistinct] why we created this series Leader Matters and we've seen two examples of very different types of styles of leadership over the last month or so. First of all with New Zealand Prime Minister Ardern and then Turkish President Erdogan. How do you think Donald Trump would have reacted to a Turkish president threatening the lives of US citizens? You were tempered in your response.

PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't have described my comments as tempered to be honest. I said that President Erdogan had failed on the promise made by Ataturk to the mothers of Anzacs. If that's tempered, well I must be quite a diplomat. I was furious about it and I'm pleased that the responses that have been made since that has reflected, I think, a respect for the Australian position.

So no, I would say that my response was incredibly strong and swift. And the result of that always has to be me thinking about the safety of Australians and ensuring that our interests are legitimately protected. See, we have a very good relationship with the Turkish people. And I think there is a bond between Australians and Turks that descend from that great conflict over a hundred years ago. And that's what I rely on. The bonds between the people. Of course, I rejected absolutely and condemned the comments that were made. But what I didn't do, is I didn't ascribe them to the Turkish people, or importantly, I did not ascribe them to Turkish Australians because I know because I spoke to Turkish leaders in Australia that morning and discussed this issue with them. And so my remarks were designed to do what a responsible Prime Minister would do; express our very deep outrage about this but also ensure that we continue to get on with the job of protecting Australia's interests and the safety of Australians.

QUESTION: You've said safety of Australians quite a lot. You get the unvarnished reports about domestic security. How worried are you as a father of two?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, worried enough to ensure that I have a national security plan which keeps them safe. I would never put - I think about my kids and my wife a lot in this context. I want to keep them safe. And I extend that to every Australian. I'm not looking for some special deal for my family and something different for everyone else. Quite the contrary. And so that's why we've invested in our security agencies and our services. That's why our Defence Forces will get back to 2 percent of GDP years ahead of schedule. Last time I was here - I stress just a couple of weeks ago - when I was out at the SAS regiment and I was going through and looking at their capability of deployment and what they're able do, I was incredibly impressed with that. I mean that's what we're investing in. I just saw the new centre that we built out there and our investments in safety and security, though, aren't just about protecting our borders - and you know what Labor will do on that front - and it's not just about our Defence Forces.

Keeping Australians safe is about keeping Australians safe from domestic violence, keeping Australians safe is about keeping kids safe from sexual predators whether in the physical world or online. Keeping Australians safe is what I have been raising with the social media companies. And that's why I've raised that with Shinzo Abe, the Japanese Prime Minister and current president of the G20. These companies, if they create these platforms, they need to make them safe and not allow them to be weaponised by terrorists or other predators. And so right across the board, my plan is to keep Australians safe. To do that, you've got to keep the economy strong. Because if you don't have a strong economy, you can't do that. Countries with weak economies don't have strong defences. And that's why having a strong economy is so important. Countries with weak economies don't have strong health systems. Countries with weak economies don't have a PBS where you list 2000 pharmaceuticals which is what our government has done. And under the Labor Party when they were in government, they stopped listing affordable medicines because they couldn't manage their budget. A strong economy is the ticket to essential service. At this election, health’s your major issue? That's the case for many Australians - the way I'm guaranteeing those health services is because we know how to run a budget and we know how to run a strong economy. That's what guarantees health services, not pledges from platforms.

QUESTION: Prime Minister, I understand that I am not the most important ginger in your life moment because One Nation is causing all sorts of dramas and most of the questions that we have coming through on this iPad pertain to One Nation and how you are going to deal with them. First of all, you've said you were shocked at some of the revelations that we've had in regards to the NRA and with comment about Port Arthur. Do you think that preferencing One Nation under Labor is going to draw a line under this issue for you?

PRIME MINISTER: Well that's the decision that we've taken and I've announced this morning and the final decision on how preferences are allocated right across the ticket, you can only do once you know who all the nominations are. Sadly, there will be a lot of competition for who goes in the final last spot. There are a lot of extremist views on the left and on the right in Australian politics and we'll work through that once we know who all the nominations are.

But, what happened this week was shocking. It was deeply concerning as the party that actually introduced our strong gun laws. And I don't care if they were drinking scotch or not, who cares, that's not an excuse. Even flippantly if it were that, and I don't think it was, the idea of our gun laws being traded for political donations is abhorrent. Now, I waited to see what the response of the One Nation leadership would be to those events and I was very disappointed. I thought it was unsatisfactory and that's why we've taken the decision that we have.

QUESTION: There's probably going to be some people that say you should preference them last.

PRIME MINISTER: Well what if Fraser Anning's running? What if Reclaim Australia is running? What about all of them? I mean there's no shortage of candidates for going lost on our ticket, I can tell you. That's alright, Bill Shorten's going to put Fraser Anning above One Nation and he's going to put Reclaim Australia above One Nation. See this is the thing. You've got to think this stuff through. It's alright for Bill to get up there and give his grab on this sort of thing. But this is the same bloke who had a six day delay, not a six second if you go on 6PR, but a six day delay on actually calling out Michael Daley, the Labor New South Wales leader going to election for saying Asian migrants take your jobs.

Now the question I have is will Bill Shorten have called him out if Michael Daley had won the election? Why did he wait till the election was over? Can't get himself off WeChat today and yesterday. But this bloke took six days and an election and only a few weeks before he was getting up there and saying Michael Daley was the saviour to everybody in New South Wales. You've got to think this stuff through. When John Howard made the same decision that I've made today, he did it in a similar way. He didn't rush into it. He thought about it carefully. And the other thing I've done, as John did - One Nation is one thing, the people who vote for them are another. Any comments I make about the behaviour of One Nation, particularly in this past week, that does not in any way extend any commentary on those who voted One Nation or considered to vote for One Nation. They are Australians with real questions about real issues going on in their communities. And my appeal to them is these other parties, they're not going to answer those questions. They don't have the answer to those questions. They're not parties in government. They have no responsibility. They'll say what they think you want to hear, but they don't have any answers to water, they don't have any answers to managing population, they don't have any answers on national security. The Liberal National Parties, the Liberal Party here in Western Australia, have those answers. And so if you're looking to answer those questions, then we are the answer to those questions. Don't flirt with these minor parties. We've seen what it's done in the Senate. Senator Reynolds here, our newly minted cabinet minister from Western Australia, congratulations Linda. We've see what that's done in the Parliament. And it's put another 10 years on Mathias’ life in negotiating these arrangements through the Senate. Both Mathias and I once used to be very good looking guys. Dealing with those things is sort of had a pretty big impact on that. But, that's what the chaos of these other parties do. And so that's why One Nation will go below Labor.

QUESTION: We've got a couple of questions about tourism. We've got a tourism problem in this state at the moment in that no one's coming here anymore and you used to be the boss of Tourism Australia. And so someone's asked, what would you do to fix this problem?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it's not always a marketing problem. But these things can be relevant. When I was Managing Director of Tourism Australia I ensured that the eight Australian tourism exchanges came here twice. And why did I do that? Because the world is always looking for, or the world's tourism buyers, are always looking for new and amazing experiences and they're all here. I mean, there are a lot of known experiences around Australia and they're fantastic, and we've got a lot to sell. But I always thought Western Australia had quite an edge in terms of the types of experiences that are on offer here in WA. So I think it is relying very much on that freshness and that newness and that more exotic side of the tourism experience here in Western Australia. Of course the accommodation and so on, but there's been real improvements here on that in Western Australia. And so it is about getting your share of voice, it is actually about connecting with those customers all around the world. But I think you've always got to focus on the things that give you the edge in any business or anything like that. And I think WA's edge has always been these incredible, quite amazing, natural experiences that you literally don't get anywhere else in Australia let alone the rest of the world.

QUESTION: You were thrust into the Prime Ministership very very quickly and it obviously has a huge impact on your family life and I remember back in August when we were seeing you frantically working the phones with everyone trying to get the numbers up, I was thinking to myself, 'I hope one of these phone calls is to his wife'. And I had this image of you coming home and Jenny answering the door and say 'How was your day, love?' and you say 'Oh, yeah I went for a walk and had breakfast with Mathias, and became Prime Minister, and picked up some milk on the way home, and changed offices, et cetera et cetera.' How did you actually keep your family abreast of what was happening on that frantic day?

PRIME MINISTER: Well you're right. Things did happen very quickly and very late for me in that piece. Pretty much the last 24 hours or so, or thereabouts, but I did call Jenny and I said, 'You might want to pick the kids up from school and jump in the car and come down', and talked to her about what was happening. I've been blessed with my family in a way that it's hard for me to put into words. They are so incredibly supportive. But what I'm trying to teach my girls is you believe in things, then you put the effort in and you champion them. I was raised by my parents that life was not about what you accumulate but what you contribute. My parents served in their local church and their local community. My dad was a policeman. My mum and dad ran a thing called Boys Brigade and Girls Brigade for 45 years every Thursday and Friday night of a school night. For 45 years. So that's the model of community service and I was brought up to go 'you're here to make a contribution', and I'm trying to teach, with Jenny, my girls the same thing. But I'm so blessed with Jen because Jenn has continued to provide a nurturing environment for our family. Her focus is very much all there and they allow me to come home every now and then and spend some time which I love more than anything else. Going down the footy with my girls, with Lily and so on or whatever we might be doing, reading books with Abbey. Precious moments, you grab them, but I'm blessed to have a great family who supports what I do.

QUESTION: You got the numbers, and so there would have been that first night in The Lodge. You made it. You're the Prime Minister of Australia. The 30th Prime Minister. Did you look around a bit, go into every room? You've seen the film Love Actually, there's this scene with Hugh Grant as Prime Minister does a dance -

PRIME MINISTER: Someone's done a meme and put my head on it. You should check it out. My wife thought it was hilarious. You'd never see me dance like that, I can tell you.

QUESTION: It must be a bizarre situation when the reality hits, when you're looking at the view in Kirribilli or sitting in The Lodge.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah. For me it was more when I was at Kirribilli because I'd spent obviously a lot of time at The Lodge as Mathias does and all senior pollies do. So that was a fairly familiar environment for a Minister. It was more when, I suppose, we had to move our family from our beloved shire in southern Sydney, largely because of security reasons and practical reasons. I remember my youngest daughter said to me - and I explained that we had to move and she wasn't that flash about it because we had a small pool in our place, like a backyard pool – she goes “is there pool?”, “Well no, there's not, next door's got one”, which is the Governor General's place in Admiralty House. And she said, “well can you ring them and ask them if I can swim in their pool?” And I said okay. So I rang Lady Cosgrove and I said, “Lily wants to know if she can use the pool”. Now Lady Cosgrove grew up in Cronulla, so she has the Shire link, and she said 'of course, of course, of course'. So I told Lily and she said “that's all good, yep, we're good Dad, we'll move, we got a pool”. That was when John Howard - and for me John Howard has been just like when I was Treasurer with Peter Costello - they are the great role models for me in my political life. And Bruce Baird who was the former member in my electorate had been just a massive influence on my political life. And I always feel like when I'm at home in Kirribilli that I'm staying at John's house and I keep expecting him to walk out of a room somewhere and say 'Oi, what are you doing here?'

QUESTION: We sometimes do a thing at the end of these events where we ask a few quick questions of the person that's our guest. All we ask is you try and keep it brief and answer it, which is going to be counterintuitive for a politician. So I'm just asking if you're ready?

PRIME MINISTER: All good.

QUESTION: Name three nice things about Bill Shorten.

PRIME MINISTER: Chloe Shorten. She's lovely. We share a commitment to at least what we believe in, I suppose. Otherwise, you wouldn't go into public life and as a fellow parliamentarian, there is respect for other parliamentarians. I've put it in those terms and don't worry, I wasn't getting too generous there. And thirdly, he's a mad Collingwood fan. I'm not. But anyone who likes going to a game, I think good for them.

QUESTION: Who's your favourite Prime Minister?

PRIME MINISTER: John Howard.

QUESTION: Who's the most under-appreciated Prime Minister?

PRIME MINISTER: That's a good question. I would say Joe Lyons.

QUESTION: Biggest foreign policy challenge for Australia?

PRIME MINISTER: Managing our independence and our national interests within the competing demands of the great powers of the world today, in our region.

QUESTION: Have you ever Googled yourself? I wouldn't if I were you. Some people -.

PRIME MINISTER: You know, it's an occupational hazard. Otherwise, you walk into an FM radio interview and they will say, 'we're doing this Google game, we've just Googled you' and then they'll hit you with five questions, so it's an occupational hazard to keep abreast of these things.

QUESTION: Are you and Waleed Aly Facebook friends?

PRIME MINISTER: No, to the best of my knowledge. I don't think I am. I might have to check those who - nope, I don’t believe we are. But you know, that's alright.

QUESTION: If you're a dictator for a day and can change just one law that you think would benefit Australia, what would it be?

PRIME MINISTER: That’s a very good question. Not that I aspire to the title you've just outlined because I think that's the best thing about Australia, is that will never happen. Take a look around the world and you see where that has happened and it reminds you just how precious our freedom is. But you know what? That law was passed. The one I'm interested in. It's called the Constitution.

QUESTION: Have you ever eaten an entire raw onion?

PRIME MINISTER: I haven't, but I've got to tell you one story on that. I was down at the markets in Melbourne, at Epping, the other week. And there's every single piece of fruit and vegetable known to humankind. And I think, if you're going as a politician and you're engaged in kicking the ball or bowling, you can't help but remember back to that image of John Howard bowling - sorry John - but any time you go anywhere near fruit and vegetable you just say 'don't eat the onion'.

QUESTION: What is your least favourite part of Australia? What do you see now is a man doing electoral maths at a speed a super computer would be proud of [crosstalk] some oxygen before you answer this, but is there one area you just think [crosstalk].

PRIME MINISTER: I've had the great privilege in many different roles both inside and outside of politics and I've got to say I've never visited a part of the country I haven't liked. I really haven't. And remember, I was in tourism before and I've seen probably more of this country than most people. But what makes every part of Australia so great to visit, and this was a key part of the tourism message that I was trying to pitch when I was responsible for it, it's actually us that's the attraction. What makes all of these places so great? Yeah, physically magnificent, beautiful, it's great. But the things that impact you are the people that you meet and Australians are awesome wherever you go. They're awesome.

QUESTION: Last question, and actually several questions have come in this, if you win a second term, what will your number one priority be?

PRIME MINISTER: Jobs. The economic strength of the country. Because from that, everything else flows. You want to do something in health, you must have a strong economy. If you want to do something in education, you must have a strong economy. You want to defend the nation, you must have a strong economy. If you don't have a strong economy, you don't have a plan for anything else.

QUESTION: Well speaking of jobs, you've got to go and get back to yours. Please thank Scott Morrison.



PRESS CONFERENCE - BRISBANE QLD

Affordable and reliable power; social media; One Nation;
PRIME MINISTER: Well thank you for your patience. Today the Cabinet met and we took further decisions on the action we must take to ensure reliable, affordable, sustainable power for all Australians right across the country. Our goal is very simple - we meet our emissions reduction targets, we keep the lights on and we keep the prices down.

That’s what our approach to these issues is all designed to achieve and that means you’ve got to get the balance right across a whole range of challenges in meeting those goals. It was a recommendation of the ACCC in a report that I commissioned as Treasurer that came back and supported the view that the Government should move to seek to examine projects where they would be in a position to underwrite - I stress not invest in, not provide money to, not provide any taxpayers funds to - but seek to underwrite the price position for particular energy projects that would be necessary to shore up their finance, to allow those projects to proceed. That’s what the ACCC recommended and that recommendation has been widely supported, including by AEMO and others within the energy sector.

This is important to ensure that we get sufficient reliable power generation into the east coast market. We have record levels of renewable investments coming into our markets currently. We have significant capacity in renewables and those renewable projects, into the future, of course will be supported by investment in projects like Snowy 2.0 which provides that firming power, the MarinusLink between Victoria and Tasmania, all of that is important. But equally we need to ensure there is reliable, affordable power.

Now we’ve already made a lot of progress on this. The reliability guarantee that has been adopted by all states and territories now provides the missing link that was present before on the national energy market on the east coast of Australia. This now ensures that reliability of supply is a key factor in the supply of energy to our national energy market. But as the ACCC recommended, we needed to go further.

So today the Government was able to agree a shortlist of projects which will now be examined in closer detail before any final decision is made on any underwriting on the price position for those projects that would assist them to secure their project finance. Now those projects are a mix, those projects have been drawn down from 66 proposals down to a dozen. Those projects will deliver around about 4,000 megawatts, which is about twice the size of what we’re talking about currently at stations like Liddell and other major coal fired power stations. So this is providing reliable power generation. It is across a range of projects in gas, hydro and one very small project which is a coal upgrade project in New South Wales in Lake Macquarie. The other projects are in East Gippsland in Victoria, a gas project; Reeves Plains in South Australia; Gatton in Queensland, which is also gas; in Dandenong, a gas project and also in Port Kembla, a gas project. A series of hydro projects from South Australia, in Lincoln Gap and Baroota, Armidale in New South Wales, Cressbrook Reservoir at Crows Nest in Queensland; projects on the Eyre Peninsula and also in Tasmania.

So we’re talking about a range of projects across the various fuel sources. Our approach has always been to have an agnostic approach when it comes to the fuel source, that’s often been referred to as being ‘technology agnostic’. What we are talking about is ‘fuel agnostic’. Wherever it comes from, we just want what is going to provide the reliability that is necessary. So these projects have been selected to undergo further examination and they’ll be able to present their case, these 12 projects, for us to form a position on using the underwriting mechanism that was recommended by the ACCC.

In addition to that, we have a very specific problem in northern and central Queensland. That is, to meet the very specific industrial needs of north and central Queensland in terms of power usage. That relates especially to things like the aluminium smelter and the other heavy industries in and around Gladstone. They need reliable power and so what we're also commissioning and providing funding for, is a feasibility analysis across a range of projects to see what best can meet the industrial power needs of north and central Queensland. Now, that will engage in a range of projects, which will also include looking at the Collinsville proposal, which is a proposal that has been around for some time. But there is no commitment to underwrite or support any of those projects, we want to do the proper analysis to work out which project or which group of projects actually delivers on the need. See, we spend a lot of time focusing on process on the questions. But what matters? Thousands of jobs in Gladstone matter and those thousands of jobs - particularly in Gladstone, but more generally in central and northern Queensland - those jobs require a reliable power supply. What my Government wants to do, is to ensure that they get that power supply. They get it at the lowest cost and they get it in the best form.

Now, in terms of the plant, the Collinsville proposal is there, that will actually have an emissions intensity which is lower, lower than the current average for the entire east coast grid. So these are projects which at the end of the day, will continue to help us meet all of our emissions reduction targets. None of those are put at risk by this, in fact they're enhanced I believe by what we're proposing here. Certainly at a global level, ensuring that we can keep industries in Australia that operate on a far more environmentally friendly basis here in Australia, than they would if they actually went offshore.

So I want to particularly thank Angus Taylor, the Minister for Energy. I also especially want to thank the Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack and the Resources Minister Matt Canavan, as we've worked together to deliver the outcome that we have arrived at today. I think it strikes the right balance which understands the challenges that our energy markets face in the short term and also over the long term. In the long term, of course we are transitioning to, obviously, renewable base reliable power supplies. That is why we have put so much precedence when it comes to hydro projects and you know where the Government has been heavily investing in those projects.

On another matter, in a few moments I will be meeting with my colleagues, the Minister for Communications, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Home Affairs, with representatives of the major social media companies. My objective is quite simple, particularly in the wake of the terrible terrorist attacks we saw in Christchurch. That is we want the same rules to apply in the online social media world, that exist in the physical world. Now, there are many challenges in this space, whether it's online bullying or predatory behaviour, child pornography, all of these sorts of things. There’s the way that social media is used to try and blacklist businesses and try and shut them down as we're seeing in some parts of the country. There is the way that these sites can be used to put forward very dangerous information for children, who may be susceptible to eating disorders. We're aware of all of those risks and these are important things that need to be addressed. But particularly today, what we will be seeking from the companies is an understanding from them about how they are going to make their products safe.

You know, if you build a car and you sell it in Australia, it has to meet with our standards of safety. The same thing is true when it comes for those who want to provide social media services here in Australia. If they build it, if they make it, then they have to build it and make it safe. Building and making it safe means you can't let a terrorist atrocity be filmed and posted and streamed and be online for 69 minutes. 69 minutes - that’s not acceptable. That has to change. We're keen to understand today, how they will use their great technological capability, which is significant. They can get an ad to you in half a second, they should be able to pull down this sort of terrorist material and other types of very dangerous material, in the same sort of timeframe and apply their great capacities to those very real challenges, to keep Australians safe. So I will be looking forward to understanding from them how they plan to meet these challenges to keep Australians safe.

But I won't be going in empty-handed. We are working on new laws that would seek to apply criminal penalties to companies that don't act in the interests and the safety of Australians. We will have more to say about that at another time. We'll be discussing some of those issues this afternoon. What I'm looking for, is for these companies to come to the table as responsible corporate citizens and to simply make sure their products are safe here in Australia and don't risk our national security.

The third thing I wanted to say to you today is in relation to the revelations regarding One Nation. There are many reasons not to vote for One Nation, it's a long list. We've seen some of those on display in recent times. Today, we saw further evidence of that; where we have reports that One Nation officials basically sought to sell Australia's gun laws to the highest bidders, to a foreign buyer and I find that abhorrent. When John Howard put those laws in under a Coalition Government, they were put in to protect Australians. No law should be up to the highest bidder, and some part of foreign interference. It is our Government that has actually put in place the laws that would make that impossible, at least it would make it unlawful in this country to do that. Those laws took effect on 1 January this year. But the fact that they were prepared to do it - if you're ever wondering why you shouldn't be voting One Nation, there’s a pretty good reason.

See, I'm not interested in getting One Nation's preferences, I'm interested in getting their primary vote. I separate One Nation voters from the One Nation Party. I know that people who have voted for One Nation in the past, have done so because of frustrations on a whole range of issues, issues that do trouble Australians. Managing the population, ensuring that our regions have jobs, that we're dealing with water infrastructure and we're supporting our farmers going through drought. They have been frustrated about these things and we saw some of this in the New South Wales election just on the weekend. The answer is not One Nation, the answer is not to go to those extremes. The answer is the Liberal and National Parties of this country and the LNP here in Queensland. Voting One Nation won't give you a stronger economy. It won't give you a stronger Budget. It won't keep your job. It won't get you a pay rise. It won't manage population growth. They're not a party of Government.

We are a party of Government that is delivering all of those things and that is keeping Australians safe. So I say to the people of Australia who have voted One Nation and are contemplating voting One Nation at the next election, good Australians, inviting them to vote for a party of Government that can deliver on the issues that concern you.

I'm not running to run second or third or fourth. Our Party is running to be returned as a strong Government that is doing the right thing for Australians. So, I believe there are questions to answer by One Nation today, about how they will be dealing with these very serious issues.

So I believe there are questions to answer by One Nation today, about how they will be dealing with these very serious issues. Our gun laws that John Howard put in place under a Liberal National Government have been keeping Australians safe for decades. How dare they seek to trade those for money and votes from a foreign buyer? That's not on. I won't put up with it. That's why I don't want their preferences, I want their primary votes, because that's the right thing for Australia. Happy to take questions.

JOURNALIST: So will you put One Nation last now in the seat of Cook?

PRIME MINISTER: I've already answered that question previously. We will be determining that at the time of nominations closing, because frankly, there are many candidates for who should go last. You won't know all those names and all those individuals and all those parties, until nominations close. I have been very consistent about this. Under our Party's structure, those decisions are made at the time of nominations closing. I said that last week, my position hasn't changed. But I'm not after peoples' preferences, I'm after their primaries.

JOURNALIST: Will you advise the LNP in Queensland to put One Nation below Labor and the Greens?

PRIME MINISTER: I just answered that question.

JOURNALIST: You didn't, Prime Minister, with respect, you didn’t.

PRIME MINISTER: I said we will make those decisions at the time of nominations closing, Stephen, and that’s when we’re going to do that.

JOURNALIST: What will your recommendation to the Party be?

PRIME MINISTER: That will be made known at the time, once we see all the nominations. See, tell me this; Fraser Anning runs a candidate in Queensland in every single seat, who goes last?

JOURNALIST: Will you run him below Labor?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I’m asking. When we know who all the candidates are, then that's when I will make my decision and the Party will make its decision about where the preferences go.

But let me tell you this about the Greens. We have stopped 15 terrorist attacks here in Australia. The Greens have opposed us on almost every single piece of national security legislation that we have put forward into the Parliament. The Greens are in favour of death taxes. Now do you think the Labor Party should be putting the Greens ahead of the Liberal Party? Fair question. There are plenty of extreme views out there and those extreme views that are a danger to Australia, are not hostage to the left or the right of Australian politics. So I'm not competing for preferences, this is the point that the bubble never understands. I'm in this race as the Prime Minister to be re-elected and the way you seek to do that in this country, is to not squabble over preferences. We saw that with the Labor Party in New South Wales and the Shooters and Fishers Party on the weekend. I mean how long did it take Bill Shorten to denounce the comments made by Michael Daley in New South Wales? One Nation called it out before him, Mark Latham called it out before Bill Shorten did. The Labor Party went to the last election in New South Wales with a leader who said “Asian migrants take your jobs” and Bill Shorten was as quiet as a lamb.

So I'm not going to take lectures from a Labor Party that can't even call out that sort of behaviour from the leader of their party in New South Wales that they wanted to be Premier.

JOURNALIST: On energy in north and central Queensland, is that limited to underwriting or could subsidies be a part of that program?

PRIME MINISTER: In North Queensland, what we’re looking to do is establish what is the most viable approach. There are no proposals for us to invest in those projects. What we have always been looking at is the underwriting provisions that can assist in those projects, gathering finance. But we’ll look at the case studies.

The key point is this; what is the most effective, most sustainable and most affordable and reliable way to save the jobs and keep the jobs of people working in north and central Queensland? We will take the best answer and once we know what that best answer is - and this project will be able to determine that once and for all.

JOURNALIST: So you wouldn't rule out subsidies?

PRIME MINISTER: We have no plans for subsidies at all, no, we don't have such a plan. What we have a plan to do, is work out what's the best project and then work out what is the best way to make that project happen. The only things we presently have in our toolkit are the underwriting powers on price, which is what we would be applying if those other projects were successful.

JOURNALIST: On social media, you mentioned the campaigns to blacklist companies. Is that a suggestion that you would ask social media or require social media to try to crack down on those kinds of ‘boycott movements,’ like Sleeping Giants?

PRIME MINISTER: All I'm simply saying is that social media is often weaponised. Weaponised to damage peoples' business, damage their lives, involve themselves in hatred and any of these sorts of issues. I think they're the negative elements of social media. I'm simply highlighting the fact that that's what happens in this country and it happens in countries all around the world. The one I'm most interested in right now, is making sure that these companies make their products safe by ensuring that, particularly in the case of terrorism, that it’s not weaponised to be actually part of the process of inflicting the terror, not just on a country but on the world.

Thanks very much.




NEIL MITCHELL: The Prime Minister is with me, Scott Morrison good morning.

PRIME MINISTER: Good morning. Good to be here.

MITCHELL: Have you got little lights you can put on your car so you can come roaring down the middle of the road?

PRIME MINISTER: [Laughter] I'll struggle through the traffic like every other Australian does here in Melbourne, that’s why we’ve got to bust this congestion.

MITCHELL: Okay, get to that in a moment.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah.

MITCHELL: We're into an election campaign, can you give me four or five words, what is your pitch, what your slogan? Why should we vote for you?

PRIME MINISTER: Under the Australia I'll continue to lead, our economy will be stronger, Australians will be safer and I'll continue to bring Australians together. Without a strong economy, you cannot pay for the hospitals and schools that you need. Under Bill Shorten, the economy will be weaker.

MITCHELL: Four or five words then, it’s; “stronger economy, safer Australia, come together”? 

PRIME MINISTER: That's it.

MITCHELL: Have you got the slogan yet? Or that’s it?

PRIME MINISTER: [Laughter] I'll leave that to others, but that's what I've been talking about from the day I became Prime Minister. Those three things Neil, you’ll probably recall, in that first press conference I did, that's what I wanted to do; keep our economy strong, keep Australians safe and keep bringing Australians together.

MITCHELL: The polls aren't good, you didn't get any real bounce from that offshore processing issue and that was pushed pretty hard. Do you still recon you can win?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes absolutely, because this is the stark choice; I mean when your economy is facing stiff headwinds that we are – yesterday unemployment came down to the lowest level in seven years, 4.9 per cent, youth unemployment down to the lowest level in seven years - our economy facing headwinds is going to put all that at risk. So you don't hand the wheel, the economic wheel, to someone who doesn't know how to drive. That's the Labor Party.

MITCHELL: Still, a lot of people say it's going to happen, all the polls say it's going to happen.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, that’s what they say.

MITCHELL: They’re all wrong?

PRIME MINISTER: The polls always say this and people say this and that about the polls. But you know who gets to decide? Australians, when they turn up to vote.

MITCHELL: We change prime minister on the basis of the polls.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, the basis of who is elected at the next election, that's going to be done by the Australian people. They will get to have their say in May.

MITCHELL: Speaking of that, is Malcolm Turnbull going to campaign for the Government?

PRIME MINISTER: He already is.

MITCHELL: [Laughter] No he’s not. In Flinders? Ask Greg Hunt about that.

PRIME MINISTER: No, he's been supporting particularly Dave Sharma in Wentworth.

MITCHELL: Okay, so he will be out there campaigning for you?

PRIME MINISTER: In the seat, I assume he’ll be out there in Wentworth supporting Dave.

MITCHELL: Have you asked him to keep his head down a bit, not cause trouble?

PRIME MINISTER: We haven't had that conversation.

MITCHELL: Do you think he will?

PRIME MINISTER: I don't feel the need to have that conversation.

MITCHELL: Don’t you?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

MITCHELL:  Well, he’s campaigning against one of your ministers in Flinders.

PRIME MINISTER: He’s been nowhere near Flinders.

MITCHELL: Ohh, what about his statement? Yes, alright. One Nation, I saw ad nauseam on The Project last night, you're not going to commit to putting them below Labor in the preferences, at this stage anyway. There’s no decision?

PRIME MINISTER: Well hang on, we’ve just got a process Neil. We'll make that decision in accordance with our normal process, not because the Labor Party wants to go around, you know, trying to force us into making decisions. I mean at the last election that it was the Labor Party that benefited from One Nation preferences, to win seats like Longman and Dobell. So it's a bit rich for the Labor Party to go around giving us lectures, particularly on the same day when they've got the leader of the Labor Party of New South Wales Michael Daley saying that Asian immigrants take our jobs.

MITCHELL:  Well the union movement has also said; “put the Liberals last”.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, the union movement, yeah. Look we're not going to take lectures from the Labor Party on this. We will make the decision the way we always do and we're certainly not going to do any deals with them. I mean we've got the Labor Party doing deals with the Shooters Party up in my home state.

MITCHELL: And you won't do deals with the Shooters?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

MITCHELL: Will you preference them?

PRIME MINISTER: We won't do any deals with them, so that means –

MITCHELL: So you haven't decided on preferences there either.

PRIME MINISTER: No, it'll just be done when we know who the nominees are, because we learned this; we've had people with very extreme views pop up in all sorts of seats. So you know, let's just wait to see who nominates and then we'll make the decision in the normal way.

MITCHELL: Well, look at that One Nation beast. Pauline Hanson, is she a racist? 

PRIME MINISTER: Look Pauline has expressed extremely strong views on these issues over a long period of time. I must say in more recent times particularly in this term of Parliament we've worked closely with Pauline on a lot of important issues - issues like family court issues, which I know she feels very passionately about. I think it's pretty easy to sort of say - and I'm not suggesting you're saying this Neil - but just go; “Well, they’ve got a view on this and they've got nothing to contribute on any other issue”.

MITCHELL: But don’t they?

PRIME MINISTER: I tend to deal with people on the issues they present to me and Pauline has never raised or come to me over those issues. What she has been coming to me about, is things like how welfare is spent and ensuring there's integrity in the welfare system and she has very deep concerns about the way the family court system works.

MITCHELL: She is described today as a racist and a bigot. Is that fair?

PRIME MINISTER: Look what I said last Monday when I was here in Melbourne is, I don't think it helps that we constantly go back to just herding people into tribes and seeking to create further conflict around this stuff. I want us to all step back from all that. I want to step back from all the name-calling. I want us to step back and say; “How about we just deal with the issues that are in front of us and stop treating politics like a sport, where you have to pick sides and throw rocks?”

MITCHELL: Well, let's look at One Nation the Party then. Do One Nation policies represent Australian values or are they at odds with Australian values? 

PRIME MINISTER: Well they’re not ones that exist certainly within my Party. 

MITCHELL: Are they anti-Australian in their values?

PRIME MINISTER: I said last night that I think there is a lack of knowledge, or awareness or understanding particularly when it comes to Islam in Australia. It can be sort of stereotyped, I think there's no doubt about that. I think it's the job of leaders such as myself to improve that understanding. But the question is are all of their policies or their policies inconsistent with Australian values, well, many of their policies are not policies I would share.

MITCHELL: Which ones?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I don't share their views when it comes to how they see a role for big government in this country. I don't share their views for intervening in so many different parts with additional regulation and things like that. When it comes to their views on immigration and the fact that they believe that, you know, it’s certain types of people in the immigration program which are the issue. So, I've never shared those values -

MITCHELL: Isn’t that itself racist? If you base immigration on race?

PRIME MINISTER: Well Neil, what I'm not going to do today - which is I think what you're inviting me to do -

MITCHELL: Well I mean I’m interested, you’re tiptoeing around One Nation. Why are you being so careful?

PRIME MINISTER: Because I don't think it helps Neil, for us to just get into this slanging match between all of the personalities here. What happened last Friday was abominable and I think the right response in relation to that, is not to get into tit-for-tat between political parties and start with; “This person is this”, or “that person is that” and “they’re to blame for this” and “they're to blame for that”.

I think the right thing to do is to reach out to the Muslim community and give them a big hug. The right thing for me to do is to turn up at a Coptic Church on Sunday with my family and pray for the victims in a Christian church that actually knows quite a lot about being impacted by these sorts of attacks. I think the right thing to do is for me to stand up in Melbourne and say; “Hey, how about we treat each other as individuals and not members of groups and try and set them against each other for public entertainment?”

MITCHELL: Well, do you think Pauline Hanson supports you on that philosophy?

PRIME MINISTER: I have no idea, I have never discussed it with her.

MITCHELL: You don’t care?

PRIME MINISTER: It's not for me to have a view about that, it's for her to have a view about what she does. She is accountable, as is her party, as is every party, for their own decisions and all the things that they say. I'm responsible for what the Liberal Party does and what my Government does.

MITCHELL: True, true, but you will to an extent be judged on your reaction to parties like this. I mean you were quite happy to take Fraser Anning’s head off for what he did.

PRIME MINISTER: Which was abominable.

MITCHELL: Which was obscene and which was wrong, but sometimes Pauline Hanson … she won’t even condemn Fraser Anning. 

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I certainly don't agree with her on that, that's for sure.

MITCHELL: But you can take his head off, you won’t take hers off.

PRIME MINISTER: I absolutely didn’t agree with what she did in the Parliament, when she wore the burqa to Parliament. I thought that disrespected the Parliament and you know, we made those comments at the time. So look, again Neil, I don't think it helps the debate if we make it about the personalities. I think what helps the debate is by being constructive.

Yesterday I was down at Punt Road with Bachar Houli and we announced $15 million dollars for the project we've got going down there, not just with his leadership program with Muslim Australians, but also for young Indigenous kids. That's what we should be doing.

MITCHELL: The reason I did raise it by the way, is Kevin Rudd has tweeted; “It's appalling that Morrison,” you, “can't simply state Liberals and Nationals, put One Nation last. Hanson’s racism and religious bigotry is as clear as day. What about some leadership, Morrison?” Not Mr Morrison either.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, Kevin Rudd doesn't get to make decisions for the Liberal Party. We have a process for making our decisions. As our record shows, we're in the Senate, we didn't preference them in the Senate last time, that's what our actions are. Labor got people elected on the basis of One Nation preferences last election. Michael Daly thinks Asian immigrants take Australians jobs. I haven't heard Kevin Rudd call out Michael Daly.

MITCHELL: No.

PRIME MINISTER: Or Bill Shorten for that matter, by the way.

MITCHELL: What has Bill Shorten done? Is he racist? 

PRIME MINISTER: Well why has Bill Shorten not disassociated himself with the comments of Michael Daly in New South Wales?

MITCHELL: On the Asians?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, why not? You’ll remember when John Howard many years ago was attacked for those things, a long, long time ago.

MITCHELL: Yeah I remember.

PRIME MINISTER: Labor had a lot to say about that, so where is Bill Shorten today? Tanya Plibersek? Anthony Albanese? When it comes to the leader of the Labor Party in the New South Wales Parliament –

MITCHELL: Well, for the same reasons you won’t bag One Nation, it's political.

PRIME MINISTER: I'm sorry, this is his own Party.

MITCHELL: It’s politically difficult, it’s the middle of an election.

PRIME MINISTER: This is the leader of the Labor Party in New South Wales who was has said Asians are going to take people’s jobs. 

MITCHELL: A fast trail to Geelong. You've talked about $2 billion dollars towards it. You'll need, when it comes in, you’ll need the sky rail, a tunnel or acquisition, which will it be?

PRIME MINISTER: Well this is the business case that is now going to be developed.

MITCHELL: Oh so this is just a business case?

PRIME MINISTER: No, it's $2 billion down, to actually make sure the project can proceed based on the business case that has to be developed. It's no different to what we did when we announced the Melbourne Airport Rail Link. At that stage we didn't have a preferred route, now we do have a preferred route. We have a heads of agreement between Dan Andrews and ourselves.

MITCHELL: But you’d agree it’s going to have to be one of those three? It can't just arrive at the edge of the city and go from 160 to 20.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, sure.

MITCHELL: You’d either need sky rail, or a tunnel, or acquisition.

PRIME MINISTER: And that’s what the process will determine.

MITCHELL: When will we be in it, when will it be running?

PRIME MINISTER: Well our best estimate at the moment is that within about two years we should be able to start construction. There's a lot to be achieved over that time and I know the State Government has already been working on this. That's one of the reasons why it's the project that we've decided proceed with. But let me put it in perspective, what this project is all about. On Wednesday I announced together with Alan Tudge and David Coleman, a population plan for Australia's future. Now that is about having the right and balanced migration settings. But it's also about having the infrastructure we need to support population growth. This project is a critical example of the sort of infrastructure we need to ensure our cities can grow.

MITCHELL: So is it ten years off?

PRIME MINISTER: Well we have to wait for the business case to be done.

MITCHELL: So the business case is two years off?

PRIME MINISTER: No the business case will be done more quickly than that, then you need to get into the advanced planning works. Then you need to get the tenders and then you need to start construction. I mean you can't go –

MITCHELL: It sounds ten years off.

PRIME MINISTER: Well you can't go into the McDonald's drive through and get yourself a fast rail to Melbourne. You can get a few other things I notice - 

MITCHELL: [Laughter] I did want to come back to that.

PRIME MINISTER: Look, these are big projects Neil, they can't just be done by yesterday afternoon and they don't start unless the Commonwealth in this case, is prepared to make this sort of a commitment of $2 billion, which we have and we'll work with the State government.

I think we're demonstrating that on Melbourne Airport Link. We took the initiative there, to put our $5 billion down, this time last year and it's moving towards becoming reality.

MITCHELL: So you like the idea of Geelong being like a suburb of Melbourne?

PRIME MINISTER: No, it's a satellite city and it has been.

MITCHELL: Yeah, they wouldn’t like that.

PRIME MINISTER: It's a city in its own right.

MITCHELL: And Albury Wodonga, you want to have a look at a business case?

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah, we’ve got a series of them.

MITCHELL: [Inaudible].

PRIME MINISTER: We’ve got a series, there's Terralgon, there’s Gold Coast, there’s Wollongong and there are already projects underway that we've done, into Newcastle and out of Ballarat and a range of other projects. So we're serious about fast rail.

MITCHELL: Matthew Guy did float this himself during the election campaign, didn't do him much good.

PRIME MINISTER: Well –

MITCHELL: It is pretty much his plan, isn’t it, the one he floated?

PRIME MINISTER: No because what I'm announcing is an infrastructure project in the context of an entire population strategy Neil, this isn't just a one-off announcement. This is a fair dinkum plan to manage population growth, which involves migration settings, investments in social cohesion, planning frameworks with state and territory governments and local governments and congestion-busting projects of over $330 million dollars here in Victoria alone. Things like Racecourse Road where I was out there with Jason Wood, $70 million for widening Racecourse Road.

MITCHELL: That’s the one in Cranbourne, not Flemington?

PRIME MINISTER: Pakenham.

 

MITCHELL: Pakenham, sorry. Tax. There is a lot of discussion about minimum wages and you’d agree they’re too low?

PRIME MINISTER: Well they increased 3 percent, the minimum wage.

MITCHELL: It’d be hard to live on, wouldn’t they?

PRIME MINISTER: Of course. Of course they would be but the majority of Australians don't live on the minimum wage, the majority of Australians are actually paid above award. But those who are actually on the minimum wage, 56 percent of them actually work for small and family businesses, not large businesses. Less than 10 percent of those who are on minimum wage, are actually employed by a large business, so those who actually pay those wages are small and family businesses who oftentimes - as you know Neal - when they're going through hard times, don't take a wage at all. See if you own a business, your wage is what you can take out of the business. Those small and family business owners often don’t take any wage.

MITCHELL: So would you look at this? If you’re on the minimum wage, you’re paying $70 a week in tax. What about a ‘shandy deal’, employers pay them a bit and you increase the tax-free threshold, give them some back in tax?

PRIME MINISTER: We actually are delivering tax cuts. We've already legislated tax cuts.

MITCHELL: How much will it give to someone on the minimum wage?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it can provide at that level, I think, it's around about a few hundred bucks.

MITCHELL: A year?

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah.

MITCHELL: I'm talking almost 70 bucks a week, you take out of them now.

PRIME MINISTER: Well that's not something that the Budget could sustain and what I also understand -  you know we also have a Newstart system, we have family tax benefits systems, we have a whole range of other payments and support that exist for people on low incomes. That's actually what the Fair Work Commission found –

MITCHELL: Well, what –

PRIME MINISTER: Let me just, this is an important point Neil - the minimum wage isn't the only form of income that people get, who are on those minimum wages. As the Fair Work Commission has found, this work has been done, they have a range of other income supports which help them in that situation. That's what the Fair Work Commission takes into account. Now they will set the minimum wage is, it's an independent process. If I say it should go up, well, that's good.

MITCHELL: I loved the fact that the child who served you at McDonalds didn't know who you were.

PRIME MINISTER: [Laughter] I think that’s great too.

MITCHELL: How often do you go to Maccas?

PRIME MINISTER: Oh, occasionally yeah.

MITCHELL: And a pot and a parma at the pub in Malvern? How often, the health police will be onto you.

PRIME MINISTER: [Laughter] Why would they be onto me for going to the Malvern Hotel? 

MITCHELL: Because you’re not allowed to eat Maccas, you’re not allowed to eat parmas, you’re not allowed to drink beer.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I’m pretty much like everyone else Neil –

MITCHELL: How often at Maccas?

PRIME MINISTER: Oh, I’d probably pop in once or twice a month, maybe.

MITCHELL: Do you have fries with it?

PRIME MINISTER: I certainly do.

MITCHELL: Thickshake?

PRIME MINISTER: Nah, I don’t go a thickshake.

MITCHELL: Coca Cola?

PRIME MINISTER: I just go the normal quarter-pounder meal or something like that.

MITCHELL: And a Coke?

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah, it’s always a Coke.

MITCHELL: A bucket of sugar and some fat.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah, bit of that from time to time.  It’s still not illegal.

[Laughter]

MITCHELL: It will be.

[Laughter]

Thank you very much for coming in.

PRIME MINISTER: No worries Neil.

MITCHELL: The Prime Minister.


WALEED ALY: Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison welcome to the Project.

PRIME MINISTER: G’day Waleed.

ALY: I want to do something I never thought I would do.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah?

ALY: Particularly in an interview with a politician. I'm going to let you set the agenda to begin with. What do you want to say?

PRIME MINISTER: It has been an extraordinary few days and you've just gotten back from New Zealand, meeting with Prime Minister Ardern, you would obviously have a keen sense of what it's like on the ground there.

These events are tectonic, they affect us all. On Friday I was in Sydney when the first news came through and at that stage it was just very unclear. We didn't really know what was happening, who it was, except for where it was happening. Obviously that was deeply distressing; in a mosque. Then as the news came through - and you get the briefings and it became crystal clear what had occurred - there was just a numbness. We all experienced it. You experienced it, we all experienced it as the news came and then the horror came, of the hatred and the ugliness that had led to this.

I have a very forthright way as you know and others know. My first response - apart from getting in contact with Prime Minister Ardern to express our deepest sympathies and to say kia kaha which as you know means “stay strong,” to our New Zealand whanau - it was to let all Australians know what had happened. To call it as it happened and what it was. To seek to bind us up.

Now in the same way – as both Prime Ministers in New Zealand and Australia - my first reaching-out was to the Muslim community. The following day I was able to meet with the Imams Council and I have many friends there and basically we hugged when we met, my friends and I. Then we spoke honestly about what had occurred and how people were feeling in the Islamic community and the feelings that were going right throughout the country. But what really impressed me was the leadership was focused on two things; they were focused on reaching out to those in New Zealand and the practical things, burials, observance of rights and so on, how that could be done and how they could assist. But the other one was to get close to their own community and help them to try and absorb and understand.

So all of us over the last four or five days, have sought to come to terms with this. It's been a very emotional time. It has reminded us I think, of the fragility of life and how quickly hate and violence can take the most important things from us.

So as I said on that first Friday night to Australians; just hug each other tonight. I think we need to keep hugging each other.

ALY: It's an attack that has kind of, I was going to say ‘reset’ but it's least caused pause. Because if I can put it in such crude terms, the community that for 15 years or 18 years has been framed in the public imagination as a perpetrator, suddenly became the victim. The reverse was also true. So we're now having a lot of discussions about Islamophobia in Australia as well as of course in New Zealand and around the world.

PRIME MINISTER: Sure.

ALY: Does Australia have an Islamophobia problem?

PRIME MINISTER: I don't know if Australians understand Islam very well and that can often lead to fear of things you don't understand. So by definition that's what it leads to, but that doesn't always translate into extremism, just like any view doesn't necessarily flow into extremism. Malcolm used to say; “Domestic violence starts with disrespect of women,” -

ALY: But not all disrespect –

PRIME MINISTER: But not all disrespect of women leads to violence.

ALY: I understand your point but when I ask about Islamophobia, I don’t mean just that people don’t understand and they are a bit apprehensive. I mean effectively, an ‘ideologized’ form, an approach - 

PRIME MINISTER: There's no doubt that exists in Australia, there's no doubt that exists in Australia but there’s –

ALY: How big of a problem is it?

PRIME MINISTER:  But there's no doubt that so many forms of hatred and stereotyping goes on in the Australian community. I mean my -

ALY: How big of a problem is this, do you think?

PRIME MINISTER:  Well, we have been tracking through our agencies, this form of extremism. Now, people use different words, I have said right-wing extremist, others have said white supremacists or white separatists. It all means the same thing ultimately. At the end of the day it's just where a view gets taken to an absolute extreme, when you're talking about supremacists and separatists.

Any community can take itself to a point where they engage in a form of fundamentalism, extremism, which is a danger to innocents. Now this is true in the Christian community, it's true in the Hindu community - in other countries I should stress, I mean we all know of violence that has occurred there - Buddhist communities, Muslim communities. Where in any of these communities, you allow fundamentalism and extremism to take hold and as a community you don't guard against that, then this is where it ends. And the great victim is innocents, the great victim is peace.

ALY: Okay. Well let me be perhaps, more focused in the way I want to ask this. Does the Coalition have a problem with Islamophobia?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't believe the Liberal Party does and I don't believe - I can't speak for the National Party, I’ll let the leader of the Nationals –

ALY: No, you can though, you are Prime Minister, it is your Coalition.

PRIME MINISTER: No, no I don’t believe so, I don’t believe so. But I’ll speak for myself -

ALY: No, no, I get that you want to speak for yourself, but it is important to focus on the Coalition generally.

PRIME MINISTER: I think it’s important for all of us – and today is Harmony Day. Harmony Day is an opportunity for us, I think, to understand difference better. You know the classic wisdom; “Seek first to understand, before you understood”. I think that is one of the important lessons of Harmony Day. The problem I have is that we don't do a lot of ‘seeking to understand first’. We often jump to conclusions about others. In politics, I think it's important that we have disagreements, but I wish we could disagree better. I wish if we did disagree, that we always didn't leap to assuming other people's motives. I think that's important.

You know, you and I can disagree and you've interviewed me before, when you're in radio and years ago and we've disagreed. But I think it's really important in Australia if we want a better society, that we've got to disagree better and respect each other more and the motives of others. Not to leap to prejudiced conclusions about others.

ALY: Sure, okay. So let me just run through some things and perhaps you can help me understand better or explain motives or whatever it might be. When you have people in your Coalition, George Christensen speaking at a Reclaim Australia rally, appearing on an alt-right podcast, speaking at a Q Society event where horrible things are said about multiple minorities. When you've got a former Prime Minister Tony Abbott saying that; “Islamophobia never killed anybody,” when actually it already had - it's not just that it was true at the time and it isn't now, it wasn’t true at the time - and suggested that when Muslim leaders condemn terrorism, they don't really mean it. ,When you have Peter Dutton suggesting that Lebanese immigration in the 70s was a mistake or that mistakes were made around it. When you have him talking about Mehreen Faruqi who is a Muslim Senator who is part of the Greens, being ‘as bad as Fraser Anning’s after the Christchurch attacks. When you have multiple, I think seven Coalition Senators shaking Fraser Anning’s hand after he gives the ‘final solution’ speech in Parliament. And when you have reports in a newspaper like The Australian that it got to the point that the head of ASIO Duncan Lewis contacted members of the Liberal Party and of the Coalition, to warn them about the way they were talking about Islam. When I aggregate all that and - there are other examples I could give - when I aggregate all that, is there something that does need to be confronted within your own Party henceforth? 

PRIME MINISTER: As leader it's my job to ensure that the tone I set, is the right tone. The tone I have set, you can you can see from my experience Waleed. I mean you may not be familiar with my experience in this area, let me tell you the story.

When I came in and the Parliament in 2007 in the seat of Cook in the southern part of Sydney, that was not long after the riots there and the revenge attacks that took place soon after. So I know what it looks like in a community, when things turn very bad and the cycle of violence is allowed to perpetuate. My predecessor Bruce Baird responded to this working with a wonderful bloke who has become a dear friend of mine Jamal Rifi. They brought the communities together by taking a whole group of young Muslim people in south-western Sydney and they trained to be lifesavers, particularly in the North Cronulla Surf Club. Now when I came into Parliament we wanted to keep up this program of bringing those two parts of Sydney together. Jason Clare, a good friend of mine and a Labor member for that part of Sydney, we decided to take young people from both of our communities and walk the Kokoda Track together, to help us understand and particularly our younger people, these two different types of cultures, what I described as “very different Australian experiences”.

Now since then, Jason I did it two more times, we walked the Sandakan death march together with a similar group and included indigenous group actually from Rob Oakeshott’s electorate at the time. We did the same thing with the Black Cat Track in 2013 and had some great young Muslim women, there some of whom were working for the AFP and again in 2015. I wasn't able to go on that one, but I helped organize one we took to Gallipoli. Now over that period of time, it has been my work in Parliament to try and build these communities together, not apart. Now that's my form Waleed and my form is to take that experience into my own Party as leader.

ALY: But is that happening? Especially when, with that track record … I'm trying to draw you on whether or not that track record is a problem and I haven’t -

PRIME MINISTER: The best way for me to address any problem is to lead by my own example and I’ve just said –

ALY:  Okay sure, but is that track record a problem in the first place?

PRIME MINISTER: Well there were a number of cases there that you've talked about where, you know, I've made comments on those at the time. I think there are a few in there that I'm not sure you're representing in the right light.

ALY: Sure okay.

PRIME MINISTER: I'll give you a good example. The comments you've referred to in relation to Peter  when he talked about the immigration period in the 1980s. Now that was a humanitarian intake where there weren't the normal assessments that would be done now. There were things that were done at that time which the Immigration Department would tell you today, they would have done differently if they'd had the lessons of that period -  

ALY: Only in relation to the Lebanese community?

PRIME MINISTER: No, they learn lessons from all sorts of areas of intake –

ALY: So why single out the Lebanese community in that context?

PRIME MINISTER: I'm simply saying Waleed that what Peter was explaining were some lessons that were learned during a period of what was a fairly tumultuous time in the world –

ALY: But he singled out the Lebanese community –

PRIME MINISTER: If your question to me Waleed is this - which I believe it is - do I think that every single statement by any single member of the Liberal Party -

ALY: That’s not my question.

PRIME MINISTER: Has always been consistent -

ALY: That’s not it's not my question.

PRIME MINISTER: Maybe you might want to rephrase it.

ALY: No, I'll just re-ask it. Does your Party and your Coalition have a problem of Islamophobia? 

PRIME MINISTER: I’ve already –

ALY: Given that track record of behaviour –

PRIME MINISTER: I already said to you before that no, I don't think the Party has that problem, I don't think the Liberal Party as a total group has that problem. No, I don't and I don't think the National Party does either.

I mean our Party is made up of a lot of individuals and in our Party, individuals have a lot more freedom to say what they think, than in a lot of other parties and it is not for the Party to answer for every single member on every single occasion -

ALY: What about though, if they are speaking at a Reclaim Australia rally?

PRIME MINISTER: I didn't support that at the time.

ALY: Yeah, but it is a problem.

PRIME MINISTER: He was a backbencher and remains a backbencher in the Government –

ALY: And an endorsed candidate I assume.

PRIME MINISTER: By the LNP, but again, do we want to get bogged down in this or do we want to move on to how we actually make things better? In terms of the individuals, I talk to all of my members and as I say, I try and lead by example. My example has been to work with the Muslim community very, very deeply. One of the hardest things I ever did as a politician was when Jamal rang me and there was a family, the El Baf family - I don't know if you remember the story about the four brothers. Jamal rang me when I was Immigration Minister and said; “These four boys have left, we think they have gone to the Middle East to fight for ISIS.” He said; “Is there anything you can do to try and prevent them from getting there?” I immediately got in touch with what was then the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, but sadly had already gone through clearances and they'd already gone through South East Asia. Those boys are all dead today to the best of our knowledge, we know two are dead. But Jamal rang me and said; “I'd like you to come and meet their parents”. So I did and I sat down with them and I was also there with Tony Abbott's knowledge, who was the Prime Minister at the time. I just sat there and listened to their grief. So, I have a keen understanding of what terrorist recruiters can do to destroy families and innocence, again, is the victim. It doesn't matter whether you're Muslim, it doesn't matter you're Christian; when evil comes it robs and it steals.

So I think the answer is not for us to retreat into tribes and try to herd people into tribes and say; “Well, you've got this problem, you've got that problem.” I think the answer is to do what I said before; let's try to better understand where we're all coming from, not try to line people up on teams.

ALY: I appreciate that sentiment, I think talking about the past is important because the only way that you can move forward, reset at a moment like this, is if you acknowledge things that have happened in the past that are a problem and that need fixing.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, let me talk about –

ALY: No, no, but let me talk about the future -

PRIME MINISTER: You also said Peter was talking about the comment made by the Greens Senator. That comment was suggesting that I and Peter Dutton were responsible for the terrorist attacks in Christchurch. Now, would you find that a reasonable statement to make?

ALY: Would I equate it with what Fraser Anning had to say? Would you?

PRIME MINISTER: That I personally –

ALY: Did she say literally that you personally were responsible?

PRIME MINISTER: That was the clear implication Waleed.  

ALY: The clear implication, okay, we’re going to get into implication –

PRIME MINISTER: I mean –

ALY: You’re comparing it to the direct statement of Fraser Anning –

PRIME MINISTER: No sorry, you raised the issue, so let me address it. 

ALY: No -  

PRIME MINISTER: Do you think it’s reasonable –

ALY: I’m trying to answer your question.

PRIME MINISTER: For any Senator to say that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs were responsible for the terrorist attacks in Christchurch?

ALY: No, I don’t.

PRIME MINISTER: Well I think –

ALY: But you’re –

PRIME MINISTER: It’s reasonable that Peter would have found that quite offensive –

ALY:  Yes.

PRIME MINISTER: In the heat of the moment when people are upset –

ALY: Oh, it was the heat of the moment thing? Is that what you’re saying?

PRIME MINISTER: Waleed, the other night, you were very emotional and I’m sure you may have said some things about me, that based on our conservations since, you think may have been a bit over the top, about my own motives when it comes to these issues.

ALY: Sorry, say that again? You think I said what?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, you were on the other night and as we discussed today, you implied that Muslims couldn’t feel safe because they had a Prime Minister who somehow had been prejudiced against them. I don’t believe that’s true.  

ALY: Okay, you know what - 

PRIME MINISTER: I don’t think you believe that’s true either.

ALY: I don’t, no, and that wasn’t the implication that I was making.

PRIME MINISTER: People say things sometimes –

ALY: But since you, Prime Minister, no, let me ask this question. Since you raise it, we’ll come to that report, that shadow cabinet report. You say that this never happened, you’ve called it a smear and a lie. Who is lying?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I can only say anyone who may have talked to a journalist to smear me in that way. Because there have been a number of members who were at that meeting who have gone on the record to support the fact that it did not happen.

ALY: Well, there were some members who went on the record, some of whom weren't at the meeting. There are other members who –

PRIME MINISTER: Phillip Ruddock was there and he said it didn't happen.

ALY: Yeah, no, my understanding - 

PRIME MINISTER: Tony Abbott was there and he said it didn’t happen.

ALY: No, no let me explain it.

PRIME MINISTER: David Johnson was there and he said it didn't happen.

ALY: Prime Minister –

PRIME MINISTER: I mean, I was there and I say it didn’t happen.

ALY: With respect, Phillip Ruddock did not say it didn’t happen, he said that he could not recall. I have looked high and low -

PRIME MINISTER: Okay –

ALY: No, but it’s an important difference isn’t it.

PRIME MINISTER: Well -

ALY: You talk about people who have been on the record. Well, there is at least one of those people on the record saying that it did happen, that being Andrew Robb.

PRIME MINISTER: No, no hang on –

ALY: You have multiple journalists reporting ‘multiple sources’ –

PRIME MINISTER: Hang on –

ALY: Let me finish the question. Let me finish -

PRIME MINISTER: No, I have to stop you there.

ALY: You can get to that point in a second. You have multiple journalists -

PRIME MINISTER: No Waleed, you have said that Andrew Robb said something that he did not.

ALY: Reporting from - I’ve read it with my own eyes today.

PRIME MINISTER: No. What Andrew –

ALY: You have – let me finish this.

PRIME MINISTER: I’ll let you finish, I apologise.

ALY: You have multiple reporters, reporting from multiple sources that it happened and you have one on the record saying the same.

PRIME MINISTER: No, that’s not true.

ALY: What I am interested in –

PRIME MINISTER: Waleed, that is not true. What is suggested is that I said that we should exploit, exploit concerns about Islam in the community to our political advantage.

ALY: Exploit I think is your word. Alright - 

PRIME MINISTER: No, that –

ALY: Let me ask you this way -

PRIME MINISTER: Andrew Robb –

ALY: Let me ask you this way -

PRIME MINISTER: Do you mind if I finish?

ALY: What did you say?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I’m sorry, Andrew Robb did not say that I did that.

ALY: No, Andrew Robb said that you raised the issue.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah, I was the shadow immigration minister at the time and I was very concerned about these issues and the way people were feeling in the community.

ALY: So when you raised those issues in that meeting, what did you say to them?

PRIME MINISTER: I was concerned that we needed to address them, which is what I've been doing inside and outside of the Parliament for the last 10 years of my life.

ALY: Address those concerns?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes, to lower them.

ALY: So what your argument was in that shadow cabinet meeting was?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I was acknowledging that there were these fears in the community and that we had to address them, not exploit them. To actually seek to try and address them.

ALY: So the reports then of other people in the shadow cabinet concluding that discussion by saying; “We have a non-discriminatory immigration policy and that's the way that it should stay”?

PRIME MINISER:  Yes, that has always been my view.

ALY: Right, but –

PRIME MINISTER: I have championed that view as a Minister, as a member Parliament for my entire public life –

ALY: Why would that need to be said though, if the discussion in the meeting was about; “How can we dampen down community concerns about Muslims”?

PRIME MINISTER: Because I think we have responsibilities - as you were just asking me to do - that where we are concerned that people would have fears about these things, that we would seek to alleviate those fears.

ALY: This was a meeting about campaign strategy and you were saying –

PRIME MINISTER: No, this was just a shadow cabinet meeting.

ALY: Okay and you –

PRIME MINISTER: Talking about policy.

ALY: At the end of that conversation somebody had to say - it was reported as Julie Bishop who I understand was chairing that meeting – said: “We're drawing a line under this because we have a non-discriminatory immigration system.”

PRIME MINISTER: Yes, that's my view and that was my view. It has always been my view.

ALY: But I still don’t understand why she would need to say that, if that wasn't a matter of controversy within the meeting? 

PRIME MINISTER: No what I'm saying is that I was concerned about those fears in the community and that it has always been my practice - as I've demonstrated to you outside the Parliament and inside the Parliament - to seek to address those. Why else do you think I would have been working like I have as I explained to you before, why do you think I would be? That's been my experience and that’s why on Saturday after these horrendous attacks, I went to speak to those at the Lakemba Mosque, I was greeted with hugs and tears. Do you think that is the act of someone who hasn't been working closely with the Islamic community in Sydney for a long time?

ALY: I'm not accusing you of not having ever worked with the Muslim community in Sydney, or even not having done it for a long time.

PRIME MINISTER: Well can’t you see that what you’re suggesting –

ALY: I’m not suggesting –

PRIME MINISTER: Is at complete odds –

ALY: Prime Minister –

PRIME MINISTER: With the experience –

ALY: I’m not suggesting –

PRIME MINISTER: That I’ve been involved in over my last ten years of public life?

ALY: Prime Minister I’m not suggesting anything. I’m simply -

PRIME MINISTER: Doesn’t it sound odd that that report -

ALY: Prime Minister I'm asking you a question about a report that is sourced from multiple people, that was reported by multiple journalists, by which all of those journalists stand.

PRIME MINISTER: Two unnamed sources, who have never gone public.

ALY: Well, one of them has.

PRIME MINISTER: Well who?

ALY: We’ve had this discussion already, I’m asking you –

PRIME MINISTER: No, Andrew Robb is not one of those.

ALY: Prime Minister I’ve asked you to explain it.

PRIME MINISTER: And I have.

ALY: You’ve provided your explanation, fine, people will just draw their own conclusions on that. I have no problem with that.

PRIME MINISTER: Waleed let me just say for the record -

ALY: Can I come - no, no, I’ve got to ask you this question.

PRIME MINISTER: Well –

ALY: You wanted to look forward and you wanted to talk about the tone.

PRIME MINISTER: I want to rule a line under this issue. It never happened, I’ve always been deeply concerned about attitudes towards people of Muslim faith in our community. I entered the Parliament after one of the most horrible scenes that we've seen on our own soil on this issue and set about immediately to try and bring communities together.

ALY: Okay.

PRIME MINISTER: I have always acted consistently with that in shadow cabinet, in the Cabinet, by my policy decisions as Minister and in my own personal conduct. So such a report is so at odds with my experience and actions, that I think that speaks for itself.

ALY: Does acting in accordance with those beliefs mean that you will be henceforth – this is about the future and about the tone you want to set as a leader - that you will be preferencing One Nation last?

PRIME MINISTER: We are not going to do any preference deals with One Nation.

ALY: Not a deal, will you on your how-to-vote cards, be putting One Nation last?

PRIME MINISTER: Those matters are determined by the Party when we know what the nominations are.

ALY: You have a very strong voice within that Party.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah and we won't do any deals with One Nation -

ALY: I'm not talking about deal with One Nation. I'm talking about a decision from your Party to preference One Nation - who by the way said that Islam was a disease that needed to be vaccinated - will you be putting them last on your how-to-vote card?

PRIME MINISTER: Well what if Fraser Anning is running candidates?

ALY: Right. So if Fraser Anning is, you will put One Nation ahead of Fraser Anning?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, you tell me -

ALY: I’m just asking.

PRIME MINISTER: Well this is the point Waleed, I don't know who is going to nominate. In the electorate of Longman –

ALY: Let me rephrase –

PRIME MINISTER: In the electorate of Longman – no, well you’ve raised the issue –

ALY: No, no, no, let me rephrase because I know what you’re going to –

PRIME MINISTER:  Waleed please let me answer one question.

ALY: No, because I’ll ask this question -

PRIME MINISTER: Oh okay –

ALY: This is going to the point.

PRIME MINISTER: I'm just trying to answer your questions. I was raising the issue –

ALY: Let me rephrase it Prime Minister –

PRIME MINISTER: On the practical issue of Longman –

ALY: I need to get through this question. Will you at the very least committed in every seat, to putting them below the Labor Party and the Greens?

PRIME MINISTER: I am going to wait to see what all the nominations are and in our Party those decisions are made by the Party organisation. I know the Labor Party wants me to do a preference deal with them. I won't be doing a deal with the Labor Party or the Greens or anyone else.

ALY: None of this –

PRIME MINISTER: The election nominations will be called, we will see the candidates and we will make our decisions at that time.

ALY: Prime Minister why are you talking about preference deals? I'm not talking about a preference deal.

PRIME MINISTER: I’ve just answered the question as to how we're going to conduct ourselves in relation to preferences.

ALY:  But you’re talking about a preference deal, which is not what I’m talking about.

PRIME MINISTER: No, I said we’re going to make these decisions at the time nominations close and then we'll apply those decisions at that time as a Party organisation.

ALY: Do you think, particularly in the circumstances that we face right now, that the Liberal Party and the National Party where relevant, should be preferencing One Nation below Labor and the Greens?

PRIME MINISTER: I’ve said we're going to make that decision at the time of the nominations closing.

ALY: What do you think?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, you’ll know when we make that decision at that time.

ALY: Do you have a view on it?

PRIME MINISTER: I'll be consulting with my own Party organisation, I won't be doing it through your program.

ALY: Why is it difficult? Why is it a difficult question?

PRIME MINISTER: Because I'm part of a Party that has a process and that Party listens to a lot of people in it's organisation who are members of our Party. That is a decision that is actually taken in each state and territory division of the Liberal Party, by the President of that Party, as part of their preferences committee on which I will have representatives. That is respecting our process.

ALY: But there is also the question of leadership, which you have raised.

PRIME MINISTER: And I’ll be exercising that at that time.

ALY: Would it not be a strong act of leadership to say right now that you shouldn't be preferencing in One Nation ahead of Labor and the Greens? It would be an uncontroversial thing.

PRIME MINISTER: No, all I’m saying at this stage is that we will never do a preference deal with One Nation and that we will settle those matters at the time of nominations closing, when we know who all the candidates are.

ALY: So does that mean it is possible that you will be preferencing One Nation ahead of Labor and the Greens?

PRIME MINISTER: No, it just means what I just said.

ALY: No, it wasn't clear to me on that point, sorry. Does that mean -

PRIME MINISTER: We will make those decisions –

ALY: You will, it’s possible?

PRIME MINISTER: Clear at the time of the nominations closing, Waleed.

ALY: Okay on the question of immigration - and here I’m not talking about the policy of immigration so much as the rhetoric of immigration, the discourse around immigration - do you think it's a problem when we talk about asylum seekers in particular through the prism of the possibility of them being rapists, of being murderers, of being paedophiles? This kind of ‘quasi Trumpian’ language? In his case applied to Mexicans.

PRIME MINISTER: Well that's only relevant if in the cases that we're talking about, that’s what is known about the actual individuals who may be subject to transfers. That was the topic of that debate at the time and that's what was said.

ALY: Right.

PRIME MINISTER: Should we ignore the fact that if there are persons who do have those records, or for whom those issues are present, that we should ignore that?

ALY: The question –

PRIME MINISTER: Like it's taboo, you’re not allowed to mention it?

ALY: No, no there are multiple points to this, one of which is that it was warning that these people would be in Australia, as though they would be in the community. The bill in question never did that. I suppose it's about whether –

PRIME MINISTER: Well no, the bill actually could do that, if they were put in community detention in metropolitan parts of the city, that’s exactly –

ALY: The bill made clear that they could be denied on those grounds and so they wouldn't get they into the country in the first place.

PRIME MINISTER:  No I'm sorry Waleed, the bill didn't do that. The bill didn't do that. So for those for whom that is a particular issue, and there is intelligence or information that relates to those individuals who have that as an issue for us, well of course we're going to take the necessary precautions.

ALY: We spoke to numerous people who were involved in drafting the bill, there seems to have been no advice that those people, with those track records, would be able to –

PRIME MINISTER: Well sorry, we are the Government and we have to implement it. We know that's exactly what can happen and we can't resist it.

ALY: Right, so do you understand though that –

PRIME MINISTER: We're implementing that bill right now, it's not ours.

ALY: I understand. Do you understand –

PRIME MINISTER: We are taking the advice on how it has to be implemented and we'll be doing that.

ALY: Do you understand though that when you frame the issue in that way, that creates an environment of prejudice? Or do you think that's not what happens?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I think we're not going to sugar-coat to the public the implications of laws passing the Parliament and Waleed, it's important that you don't either.

ALY: No, I’m not in the process of doing anything of the sort.

PRIME MINISTER: In your commentary on these things, all journalists I think, have to be careful that they don't create a false impression of the risks that need to be managed.

ALY: I am asking you a question about whether or not describing people, Prime Minister –

PRIME MINISTER: The only people are described like that, are people that you could make that description of.

ALY: I feel like it’s very difficult to get through a sentence at the moment. The question really is about whether or not front-footing that description of these people, when there are so few of them in that category - and the categories that we were being warned about ended up being so vanishingly small once further questioning was applied to them – that that creates -

PRIME MINISTER: Well actually we’re talking about a number. 

ALY: That that creates a prejudice.

PRIME MINISTER: No, no Waleed, you've got to be honest with people. If a bill that was put forward and supported by the Labor Party, was going to be creating risks for managing the transfer of people into the community, then I'm not going to tell the Australian people what those risks don't exist. I'm not going to sugar-coat it. There are real risks, there are very real risks. I mean people used to accuse me of this when I was talking about what we needed to do to actually get our borders under control. They used to accuse me of all sorts of motives. But I was right, it needed –

ALY: And how many people were in this category?

PRIME MINISTER: My last advice on all of those of whom there were some serious concerns on character issues, I think was over about 50.

ALY: No, 50 murderers, rapists and paedophiles?

PRIME MINISTER: Not only those but also people who had serious character assessments –

ALY: No, no how many, how many murderers, rapists and paedophiles are we talking about?

PRIME MINISTER: They were actually published –

ALY: How many?

PRIME MINISTER: We had people with character concerns, over 50 people Waleed –

ALY: No, no that’s not what I asked. How many murders, rapists and paedophiles? It’s an important question because that's –

PRIME MINISTER: They were among those 50, that’s true.

ALY: Among? Two among? Three among? 50 among?

PRIME MINISTER: So how many rapists – no, let me put this to you Waleed. How rapists and murderers should be transferred to the Australian community?

ALY: I would say none, which is what the authors of the bill contend.

PRIME MINISTER: And they were wrong, they were wrong Waleed.

ALY: No, no but let me ask you the question. Because as you say –

PRIME MINISTER: There only needs to be one Waleed, that’s my answer.

ALY: And if the Minister has discretion to stop that person?  

PRIME MINISTER: But they don’t.

ALY: They do.

PRIME MINISTER: They do not Waleed. I’m sorry, I’m the Prime Minister, I’m responsible for implementing it and I have the full availability of the Attorney General, the Attorney General’s Department, the Department of Home Affairs and their advice to me is, no, we don't have that power. So I don't know whose advice you're relying on, but I'm sorry, you don't know.

ALY: So because of that one person. Is it one by the way?

PRIME MINISTER: No it's more than one, it's well over that –

ALY: Okay can you give me that number, I am actually interested to know it.

PRIME MINISTER: I've already told you there's, there's almost 60 actually who were identified as having serious character concerns, that in other circumstances we would never allow to be transferred to Australia. So that's enough –

ALY: You know that’s not the question I’ve asked.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I’ve asked you the same question and you’re saying ‘no rapists’.

ALY: There were reports about murderers, rapists and paedophiles.

PRIME MINISTER: They exist and they are there –

ALY: How many? How many of those 60?

PRIME MINISTER:  And those crimes have been committed actually in Papua New Guinea.

ALY: How many of those 60?

PRIME MINISTER: There are a number, I don't have the numbers to hand, but this is getting into a semantic discussion. What I'm saying to you Waleed is this though; don't sugar-coat this stuff.

ALY: I’m not.

PRIME MINISTER: It doesn't excuse it.

ALY: I have no interest in sugar-coating any of it.

PRIME MINISTER: Well I'm afraid mate, sometimes you could be accused of it.

ALY: Yes? Is that what you’re doing now?

PRIME MINISTER: Well you're saying that there was no risk Waleed.

ALY: I'm asking you, no –

PRIME MINISTER: And there was there was risk and you say it didn't exist because the bill didn't allow for it. I'm telling you that's wrong.

ALY: I'm saying the bill protected against that risk.

PRIME MINISTER: So I was always trying to be honest with the Australian people about the risk.

ALY:  And I’m not sugar-coating anything with that. Let me ask you about one final area here. What needs to happen now communally, from the Government? What does the Government need to do, what leadership does the Government need to show to lower the social temperature in Australia, do you think?

PRIME MINISTER: You mean particularly after Friday?

ALY: Yeah.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, exactly what I did do. The first step, call this out for what it was. Next step, go and sit down with Muslim brothers and sisters that I know and express my deepest and serious condolences and talk about the issues we needed to manage straight away. On Sunday, I went to the Coptic Church in Arncliffe in Sydney, a community no stranger to shootings in churches, who understand probably more than most how deeply these things can affect communities. I went there and spoke there, prayed there with my family. On Monday, I went to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce here in Melbourne and I gave a speech which talked about the need for Australians to see each other as individuals, hot herded into particular groups. That we could actually respect each other and the motives that sit behind each and every individual and not make assumptions about people based on what other people have said. That we need to disagree better, not necessarily agree more. That we didn't allow conflict in debate to become more sport than an entertainment, but that we were able to get behind that and actually have real community-building initiatives which are exactly the type of initiatives I announced on Wednesday of this week.

ALY: So, I fully –

PRIME MINISTER: Initiative Together for Humanity, which we put $2.5 million in, initiatives like the one we announced today with Bachar Houli down there at Richmond at Punt Road. These types of programs which I've been supporting and my Government has been funding for years now. That's what we need to do.

ALY: So I fully expect that when someone, one of your political opponents behaves in a way that is contrary to the spirit of that, that you will censure them. I fully expect that. Do you think you will do it when it comes from within your own set of political allies?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I have. So again Waleed, look to the experience that I've laid out for you tonight and don't prejudge me.

ALY: I’m not prejudging, I’m asking the question. Will you henceforth -

PRIME MINISTER: That's my form Waleed.

ALY: So next time –

PRIME MINISTER: I'm happy to call out people, as others have sought to call me out on things, I'm not shy about doing these sorts of things. I'm not shy about doing these sorts of things because I know what my values are and I know what I have done in my life, to try and build these bridges between communities.

When I became Prime Minister I said I want to do three things; I wanted to keep the economy strong - because if you don't have a job you don't have a lot of choices. If the economy is not strong you can't pay for service like hospitals and schools.

I said I want to keep Australians safe - and that wasn't just about strong borders and our Defence forces, it was about the biggest ever plan for countering domestic violence in Australia's history, at $328 million which we announced just the other week.

And I said I wanted to bring Australians together. Now I have form on all these things Waleed and I'm bringing Australians together. I think you'll find it hard to find another member of Parliament who has not made at least the same effort that I have to build these bridges between these communities.

I continue to do that as Prime Minister each and every day because you know, we've got to love all Australians. It doesn't matter what their background is, it doesn't matter what their religion is, it doesn't matter what their ethnicity is. We are the most successful multicultural country on the earth, the best immigration nation of any country on the earth. That's my responsibility to make sure it stays that way and that's my absolute commitment.

ALY: Prime Minister I wish you all the best with that endeavour.

PRIME MINISTER: Well I look forward to your support and we will be doing it.

ALY: We’ll certainly be watching and supporting, absolutely where that does happen.

PRIME MINISTER: Cheers.

ALY: Thank you very much for your time.


PM Morrison addressing the media
PRESS CONFERENCE, CANBERRA ACT

PRIME MINISTER: During the past few days, in what has been a very difficult and sensitive time around the world, obviously as the New Zealand Prime Minister and I have been addressing the terrorist attacks in Christchurch, remarks have been made by the Turkish President Erdogan that I consider highly offensive to Australians, and highly reckless in this very sensitive environment.

They are offensive, because they insult the memory of our ANZACs and they violate the pledge that is etched in the stone at Gallipoli, of the promise of Ataturk to the mothers of our ANZACs. So I understand the deep offence Australians would be feeling about this. It is truly upsetting. I have conveyed that in the strongest possible terms to the Turkish Ambassador today and I do not accept the excuses that have been offered for those comments. There will be further meetings held today between our ambassador and the Turkish government, and foreign ministers will also discuss this matter today, but I have made it very clear about where Australia stands on this matter.

I believe the comments also completely misrepresent the very strong position taken by the Australian and New Zealand Governments in our response to the extremist attack in New Zealand that was committed by an Australian, but in no way, shape, or form, could possibly be taken to represent the actions, or any policy or view of the Australian people. All Australians have condemned it, as, indeed, I have, swiftly, and the New Zealand Prime Minister has. But not only that, it has not just been our condemnation of that attack, but it has been our response, both as countries, who have an open, tolerant society, accepting of all faiths and peoples, that we have reached out to embrace our Muslim brothers and sisters in New Zealand and in Australia, quite to the contrary of the vile assertion that has been made about our response.

The response of our free people in New Zealand and Australia, I think, is the message that needs to be communicated to the Turkish people, and I believe is a view respected by the people of Turkey and certainly by Turkish Australians. In my own discussions with Turkish Australian leaders this morning, they have expressed to me their deep disappointment about these comments. They don't represent the views of Turkish Australians. Turkish Australians have made an extraordinary contribution to this country and particularly over more than a century as they've joined with us to commemorate the battles of Gallipoli. They have demonstrated, I think, both a spirit of goodwill and I know that they would not seek to be associated with these comments at all.

So what I'm saying is this - I am not going to single out the comments of one person and ascribe it to a people, whether in Turkey or across Australia. I don't think it does reflect the views of the Turkish people, or certainly of Turkish Australians. My job is to keep Australians safe. My job is to ensure that we act in a measured way to take the temperature down and ensure that we continue to work to foster goodwill between peoples. That said, I am expecting, and I have asked, for these comments to be clarified, to be withdrawn. I've asked for these comments, particularly their reporting of the misrepresented position of Australia on Turkish television, the state-sponsored broadcaster, to be taken down and I expect that to occur. I will wait to see what the response is from the Turkish Government before taking further action, but I can tell you that all options are on the table.

But my actions here are to be measured, to de-escalate, to not engage in a cycle of recklessness, but to engage in a positive spirit and to focus on the key issue before us, and that is to reach out to our populations here in Australia and New Zealand and provide comfort and support to those who have been the victims of these horrific crimes.

Also, the travel advisory to Turkey is obviously under review, and that is a process that will take some time and when that has been concluded, we will make a further announcement.

JOURNALIST: What's your advice today though, Prime Minister, to those thousands of Australians who are planning to go to or may already have booked to go to Gallipoli next month for ANZAC Day?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think there's a common-sense response to that, to be mindful of the nature of these comments and to await further advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. But I think people should exercise common sense in relation to their travel plans.

JOURNALIST: Are you concerned that these comments by the President expose or open Australia to terror attacks?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I believe that how we respond to this - which is, frankly, in sorrow, in disappointment - is the appropriate response, and to appeal to the goodwill of the relationship that has existed for a very long time and to see that put back on its appropriate footings. I don't intend to sort of engage in that cycle I referred to, to ensure that we can keep Australians and Turks safe.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you have a deep connection we know to the ANZAC story. Can you give us a sense of your immediate reaction when you heard these remarks from President Erdogan?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I was just deeply offended, as any Australian would be. The first thing that came to my mind was the promise of Ataturk. I mean, Ataturk sought to transform his country into a modern nation, an embracing nation, and I think these comments are at odds with that spirit and the promise that was made to Australians, that we have relied upon, I think, to build the good relationship that we have.

JOURNALIST: What do you mean by ‘common sense’? Are you suggesting that Australians put their travel plans on hold?

PRIME MINISTER: I think they should exercise caution and await further official advice.

JOURNALIST: Could you expand, please, on your comment that all options are open?

PRIME MINISTER: Only to say that all options are open.

JOURNALIST: Is it an apology that you're demanding from Erdogan?

PRIME MINISTER: I'm seeking a response in the good faith of our relationship.

JOURNALIST: What was the ambassador's explanation for the President's comment?

PRIME MINISTER: The excuses I don't accept are that things get said in the heat of the moment. The excuses that I don't accept are that things are said in an electoral context. I expect, in our relationships with our friends, that we always act in the good faith of that relationship. There is an opportunity, I think, for that to now take place. I will extend the time to do that. I should also note that I've spoken with the Leader of the Opposition and he endorses this approach that I am taking and we appreciate that. I am also keen to ensure that we continue to liaise very closely with New Zealand on this.

JOURNALIST: Can I ask Prime Minister, have you seen the vision? Because they seemed to be very warmly received, these comments. People cheered, the crowd applauded, they chanted. What do you make of that? He's obviously playing to a certain section of his community and his electorate in his campaign events.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I choose to have faith in the tremendous relationship between the Australian and Turkish people, which has been experienced by Australians as they've travelled with Kiwis to Gallipoli for many, many, many years and the experience, the hospitality and goodwill of the Turkish people. I choose to believe in the good faith and great citizenship of Turkish Australians in this country. The Gallipoli mosque, as it's known, in Auburn, and as a result, that's what I choose to have faith in. As you know me, I always am the optimist. I always will seek to act in good faith and I simply would hope that others would do the same. Thank you very much.INTERVIEW ON ABC NEWS BREAKFAST

MICHAEL ROWLAND: We're joined from Canberra by the Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Prime Minister good morning. 

PRIME MINISTER: Good morning Michael.

ROWLAND: The current intake is not much above 160,000, that’s the new cap you're announcing. So what difference will this make?

PRIME MINISTER: Well this is a responsible plan to manage our future population growth. It's not only about the change to the cap as you say, coming from 190,000 down to 160,000. It's about the congestion-busting infrastructure and other major projects we're putting around the country. It’s about the plan that we’ve got in a framework with the states and territories, who will have a bigger say about the intake into their states and territories. That comes out of the COAG meeting I took these plan to last December. Of course, it's about achieving greater cohesion, bringing Australians together wherever we are in Australia, investing in more of those social cohesion programs that support migrants in our community, to be successful.

ROWLAND: The economic benefits of migration are unquestioned as you know.

PRIME MINISTER: Sure.

ROWLAND: We do know, as you also know, that the economy is slowing, so won't this hurt the economy down the track?

PRIME MINISTER: No it won't because it's a responsible cap. The employer-nominated positions under the plan will be maintained. The skills and occupation list particularly for regional areas, will remain at their expanded levels to ensure that they can get the skills they need and the places they need them. It's also about ensuring Michael, that the congestion that occurs in our major cities - that can be a sheet anchor on growth as well, a tradie doesn't get paid for sitting at a traffic jam, he or she doesn't build anything when they're sitting there, it happens when they get on site - so it's important that we manage the quality of life and the liveability of our cities.

The Productivity Commission, I tasked as Treasurer to tell me what the big productivity challenges were going forward. The management of our cities and population was a key one of those. That’s why we’re acting on this and I began that process after becoming Prime Minister.

ROWLAND: But equally Prime Minister how much of this congestion is due not so much to migration, but state governments of both stripes, not thinking strategically and thinking ahead, building your roads, building your rail lines many, many years ago?

PRIME MINISTER: This is why our plan does address those issues, Michael. It's not just about the migration settings. They're responsibly settings, but equally it is about those other points I mentioned; the congestion-busting infrastructure in our congestion-busing fund, dealing with some of those specific road projects that need attention. I was at Fullerton Road just yesterday in Adelaide, there’s 60,000 cars that go down there, it needs to be widened. We're going to invest in that project with the South Australian Government and there’s countless others of these projects around the country. It's about a planning framework with the states and territories to ensure that we are lining up infrastructure spending with how we're managing migration. It's also about making sure Australians come together and we can live together. We are the most successful immigrant country on earth. Michael Daley from New South Wales doesn't seem to agree with me on that, he's made rather appalling comments regarding the contribution of Asian migrants to this country. I completely reject those comments and I think Bill Shorten should disassociate himself as well.

ROWALD: A few other issues before you leave Prime Minister. The Turkish President Erdogan overnight, visiting Gallipoli, and speaking of the Christchurch attacker said, and I’m quoting him directly regarding the many Australian who visit Gallipoli each year: “Your grandparents came, some of them returned in coffins. Have no doubt we will send you back like your grandparents." What do you make of that comment?

PRIME MINISTER: I find it a very offensive comment, of course I do. I will be calling in the Turkish Ambassador today to meet with me and discuss these issues. I have denounced, Australia has denounced, New Zealand has denounced, absolutely and completely, the act of extremist right-wing terrorism, white supremacist terrorism that we saw in New Zealand. We could not have been more forward-leaning in offering our great condolences and support to the Muslim community, both in New Zealand and Australia. I find the responsibility in these situations, I think of all leaders, is to take the temperature down on these issues. I don't intend to seek to escalate that in the response I'm giving today. So I’m going to be speaking directly to the Turkish Ambassador about this.

We've had a tremendous relationship with the Turkish people over a long period of time. We've seen that in the spirit in which Anzac Day has been able to be commemorated each and every year. So I don't find these comments very helpful, I don’t find them very accurate or truthful as well, because the actions of the Australia and New Zealand Government have been consistent with our values of welcoming and supporting people from all around the world. We are the most successful migrant countries and particularly Australia, on the planet today. We are an example to the rest of the world about how we can all live together in peace and harmony. I think Australia and New Zealand has a lot to offer the rest of the world and perhaps, they should be looking more closely at the example we set.

ROWLAND: I also want to give you the opportunity on national TV to clear up a controversy that has been swirling in the past few days. Do you Scott Morrison, in a shadow cabinet meeting back in 2010, did you urge the Coalition to capitalise on anti-Muslim sentiment for political purposes?

PRIME MINISTER: Absolutely not, it is a disgraceful smear and an appalling lie.

ROWLAND: Have you ever in any shadow cabinet or Cabinet meeting raised that thought.

PRIME MINISTER: No.

ROWLAND: Your office has threatened to sue the Ten Network which raised this allegation on Thursday, for defamation. Will you proceed with that?

PRIME MINISTER: I have no intention of doing that, I just simply want people to report the truth and that is an ugly and disgusting lie. I reject it absolutely.

Over the last decade Michael, I have spent my time as a public figure working with the Muslim community in south western New South Wales. I have walked the Kokoda Track with my Muslim brothers and sisters, I’ve done it on the Sandakan Death March. I have done it on the Salamaua Track in Papua New Guinea and organised, together with my good friend Jason Clare, similar visits to Turkey for the centenary of ANZAC. That’s why I’m welcomed when I attend mosques in south western Sydney, with warm embraces. Perhaps if people focused a bit more on the story they don’t want to tell about my relationship with people of all faiths in this community, then perhaps they wouldn’t leap to make prejudiced conclusions.

ROWLAND: Okay Prime Minister, just before we go, you speak a lot of boosting harmony, which a lot of people would agree with. In that vein, will the Liberal Party put One Nation last on it’s how-to-vote cards in the election?

PRIME MINISTER: We won't be doing any preference deals with One Nation. I do notice that the Labor Party did at the last election. I’m not going to take lectures from the Labor Party who had -

ROWLAND: Prime Minister you mention no preference deals, but the –

PRIME MINISTER: I haven’t finished Michael.

ROWLAND: The question was, will you put the –

PRIME MINISTER: Michael do you mind if I finish my answer? At the last election, the Labor Party did a preference deal with One Nation that saw people like the Member for Dobell elected into the Parliament. So we will wait until nominations close and then as is always the case, we will set our preferences on the full range of tickets. Because we don't know who some of the nominees are going to be. What if Fraser Anning runs candidates all around the country? So we're not going to prejudice that, we’ll go through the normal process. I won't be doing any preference deals, that's the same policy that we've had for years, there’s no change to that position. There hasn’t been -

ROWLAND: But you can't guarantee you will put One Nation last. Not -

PRIME MINISTER: I know that's what the Labor Party wants you to ask me Michael –

ROWLAND: It’s - Prime Minister, the Labor Party hasn’t asked me to ask anything, I’m - 

PRIME MINISTER: They’ve been putting it around the entire gallery for the last three days Michael and I think it's quite appalling that the Labor Party would be putting this about, when they themselves were the ones who did deals in the Senate with One Nation, at the last election. So I'm not going to buy into it.

ROWLAND: Prime Minister Scott Morrison thank you so much for joining us on News Breakfast.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks, great to be here.



INTERVIEW ON SUNRISE

SAMANTHA ARMYTAGE: Prime Minister, good morning, welcome.

PRIME MINISTER: Good morning.

ARMYTAGE: Now, you have said it’s your job to have a plan for managing our population, we agree with you. So will you be successful in directing migrants to regional areas? And what support in these regional areas once migrants get out there?

PRIME MINISTER: Well you’re, Australia does need a plan for population growth management, that’s one of the things I said when I became Prime Minister and that’s what we’re releasing today. The way we are encouraging people to go into the regions is through a number of points. First of all, for students going into the regions, they will get an extra years work right should they study in a regional area. So that’s population going into regions that can actually support regional economies. We should also be clear here that the regions we're talking about are out of the big cities, so it includes Adelaide, it includes Darwin, it includes places like Newcastle. So we’re talking about other urban areas, we're not talking about outback towns, but where there are opportunities in those places, of course that is encouraged.

The skills test, the skills points test, you will get extra points for going out into the regions as well. There are more occupations listed under our skills program in these areas than there are in the big cities, so it is very much an encouragement program and incentive program. And at the end of the day, if you're looking for permanent residence and you have a visa that has you in a regional area out of the big cities, then obviously, if you come and live in the big city, then you won't get a permanent visa. So there is very a big incentive to stay with the program there.

But when people get jobs in these areas, and we only talking about people going into places where there is the jobs, where there is the services and opportunities, where we have got a lot of shires and councils around the country saying to us, “we want people”. I was in Adelaide yesterday with Premier Marshall, he’s saying we want more people, so this facilitates that.

DAVID KOCH: Now the Opposition has questioned the timing of this immigration announcement, given what we’ve seen in Christchurch. Does that wash with you?

PRIME MINISTER: No it doesn’t. I think it’s disappointing. I made it very, very clear - this is about managing population, it’s about infrastructure investments, it is about congestion busting on our roads, it’s about actually having social cohesion programs which I’m announcing today, which is about bringing more Australians together. It is a plan to work with the states and territories. They will get an increased say about the intakes in their states and territories from less than a fifth to more than a quarter. It’s about managing our population growth and I think to conflate it with other issues is very disappointing. I can understand why Labor would be sensitive about this given Mr Daley's comments in New South Wales, I found those comments about Asian immigrants to be very upsetting and offensive and I think Mr Shorten should disassociate himself from those comments.

ARMYTAGE: OK, now sweeping changes to the welfare system are also going to be announced today. Job hunters are going to be allowed to search for work on their home computer or smartphone, there is a new app coming. How will that help jobseekers?

PRIME MINISTER: Well we’ve already had more than 1.25 million jobs created since we were first elected and one of the reasons we’ve been able to do that is through these services. We’re increasing greater flexibility into jobactive to mean that we still have clear rules and clear standards. But the plans will be more targeted to those individuals, it’ll be different in rural areas where there may be different opportunities in city areas. So it’s a more flexible plan giving people more tools, both helping those people find jobs and those people looking for jobs. But our economic plan is creating jobs. Another 1.25 million jobs over the next five years and that’s on top of the 1.25 million since we came to government.

KOCH: You have appealed to world leaders to crack down on social media platforms following the Christchurch Mosque attack. What you want them to do?

PRIME MINISTER: I want the social media companies to use their technology to ensure that instantaneously, their platforms cannot be used as weapons by terrorists. If they can geotarget an ad to you based on something you’ve looked at on Facebook within half a second - it is almost like they are reading your mind - then I'm sure they have the technological capability to write algorithms that screen out this type of violent and hideous material at a moment’s notice. They built these things, so they should have the technology to make them safe and we need to act in concert with other countries.

I was speaking to Jacinda Ardern about this last night, I will be seeking to speak to others. There was a meeting up in Japan yesterday that we participated in and I welcome the support that we are getting the support from other countries there. I think there will be a groundswell on this and as we go forward to the next G20 meeting, if we can act together as we have to make sure they pay their taxes, I think we can make sure we can act together to ensure that they keep our citizens safe. These tools are good, they can be very positive, connecting families - I don't want to touch any of that, I just want to make sure that these platforms cannot be weaponised by terrorists to spread their hate and their violence.

ARMYTAGE: Yeah let’s hope they’re listening and they start using it for good and not for evil. Prime Minister, we have to leave it there, thanks for your time.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks guys, good to talk to talk to you.RADIO INTERVIEW ON ABC AM

SABRA LANE: The Federal Government is unveiling a population policy today. It will cap the nation's permanent migration intake at 160,000 people for the next four years. That's about the level it's at now. It's a reduction of 30,000 places. It's also introducing a new skilled worker visa covering 23,000 migrants. But it will require them to live in regional areas of the nation for a minimum of three years as a condition for them securing permanent residency. It's also promising better fast rail links to some regional cities to help relieve congestion. The Prime Minister Scott Morrison joined me a short time ago, but we began with questions about the New Zealand investigation. Prime Minister thanks for joining AM.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you Sabra.

LANE: How would you quantify the threat of right wing extremists in Australia?

PRIME MINISTER: I think it's serious and I think it always has been and that's why at the federal level our agencies have always taken it seriously. And the work that they've done over a long period of time I think has greatly assisted us, particularly in recent days when we've been responding to the issue, the terrible tragedy in Christchurch, the terrorist attack, to ensure that we're well prepared for the response that was needed here.

LANE: The New Zealand minister over there Andrew Little says that authorities there were only really alert to this midway through last year. What assurances can you give Australians here that their investigations are on point?

PRIME MINISTER: The Australian investigations picked up immediately and we've been assisting not only directly with the inquiries in New Zealand but also providing assistance and coordinating that investigation linking up with other countries around the world. When it comes to our knowledge of white supremacists or separatists or other extreme groups like this, we have got quite a bit of intelligence in these areas and it goes back quite a way on these groups. So we'll continue to act on that and that is very much informing our participation.

LANE: Where would you suggest voters in the upcoming federal election put One Nation and the Shooters Party?

PRIME MINISTER: Well we're not having any preference deals with One Nation, we’re not having any preference deals with the Greens or Labor for that matter. You know, when the nominations are all set that's when our preferences are determined.

LANE:  Yeah. Will you instruct your organisation to put them somewhere?

PRIME MINISTER: Well we'll wait for who is on the list of every candidate all around the country. I mean, as we've seen in the past, there can be some individuals who present very, very extreme views even beyond those of some of those you've mentioned. So I mean, we'll wait to see what all the nominations are and that's our normal process. It was at the last election that Labor did a preference deal with One Nation. I recall it. The Member for Dobell was elected on the basis of it.

LANE: Is a censure strong enough for Fraser ending in Parliament? Some want him suspended for the rest of the term.

PRIME MINISTER: Well look, the suspension is a matter that the Senators will consider. I understand that's being discussed, but in terms of a motion that is currently being moved by the Government with the support of the opposition I think is highly appropriate. But I think he should face the full force of the law, personally, and that is what I expect state and territory police authorities to be looking at.

LANE: In regards to assault, or in regards to hate speech?

PRIME MINISTER: I think there are a range of avenues open there and I'd expect people to be applying the law.

LANE: Onto your announcement today, this intention has been flagged for a long time. The rate that you want is one that Australia is currently close to. Is this confirmation of something already happening?

PRIME MINISTER: What today is is about a comprehensive plan for Australia's future population growth. I want to see Australians getting home safer and earlier to spend time with their families. I want to see tradies being able to get on site, not sit in traffic jams. And that means you need a balanced, responsible migration settings but it also means taking opportunities outside the big cities. Whether that's in Adelaide or Darwin or in regional locations like Newcastle or places like that, it's about seizing the opportunities where they present and relieving the congestion burden where it's really impacting on quality of living. And so that's what the plan is designed to do and that means busting congestion with the infrastructure investments we've made, planning for future population growth together with the states and territories to take on a much bigger role, moving from determining less than a fifth of the total intake to more than a quarter. And then of course continuing to bring Australians together and working on the social cohesion, the social fabric which provides the very opportunity for continued prosperity and Australians living well together.

LANE: The Chamber of Commerce and Industry's James Pearson has described this shift as an economic own goal. He says it's very disappointing that you're imposing a lower cap. How do you respond?

PRIME MINISTER: I think once James has the opportunity to actually read the policy I think he will react in a more measured way -

LANE: I've spoken to him personally this morning.

PRIME MINISTER: He's entitled to his view but I think what Australians need and our economy needs is a balanced and responsible migration plan. I mean, under this plan we're seeing increased places for employer nominated skilled visas. Under this plan we're seeing opportunities for more regional visas where there are some more than 40,000 job vacancies in regional Australia. So this is about ensuring that our migration plan is tied towards where the opportunities are and relieving the congestion which can slow economic growth. I mean, a tradie isn't getting paid when they're sitting in a traffic jam. They get paid when they get on site.

LANE: Sure.

PRIME MINISTER: And his members who are tradies will want to get on site and have a good migration plan that helps them do that and infrastructure to back it up.

LANE: This announcement comes three days out from a crucial state election where population growth and congestion are very big issues there and where the incumbent Liberal Party is in trouble. What's the public to make of this timing?

PRIME MINISTER: That this is an important plan that we've been working on from the day that I became Prime Minister. I took these matters to COAG last December. This has been the product of an enormous amount of work. And I said that it needed to be finalized before we handed down the Budget because the migration settings, as handed down in the Budget Sabra which as you know is in less than a fortnight. I think the issues that relate to this matter in the New South Wales election are the outrageous comments by Mr Daley. I mean, Mr Daley has basically said that Asians take Australian jobs and I've just find that abhorrent with all the talk about these issues lately. I mean, I denounced those comments and I think Bill Shorten should do the same.

LANE: What is the economic… where is the economic modelling and what are the economic benefits of your announcement, given that migration is a very strong economic stimulus?

PRIME MINISTER: Well the fiscal impacts of this plan are no impact, it has no impact on the Budget and that's what we've been working through and that's why it is, I think, a very responsible level of intake. There are others who would have liked to have seen lower levels of intake. I don't share those views. This level of intake I think is the one that continues to support the important employer nominated skill stream. 70 per cent of our intake under this plan is skilled and that's the program which helps drive the economy forward. So this is a positive plan for the economy. There is nothing to suggest that this would do anything other than support our current growth levels in the economy, whilst avoiding the serious congestion problems which can slow our economy down.

LANE: 23,000 migrants will be required to live in regional areas under this plan. How will you force them to do that and will there be jobs for them?

PRIME MINISTER: No, look that is a misrepresentation of the plan. What it is is the opportunity for 23 classes for skilled migrants to settle and remain in regional Australia. No one's being forced anywhere. This is an opportunity for people and we're talking about places outside the big cities. So that includes Adelaide, it includes Darwin.

LANE: Sure but how you can you can't compel them to live in those places.

PRIME MINISTER: Well what the visas will do will say that if you have complied with the terms of the visa to live in a regional area, then you will be able to apply for permanent residency. Now this is what is very important at the end of the day, if you comply with the arrangements particularly for the issues around where student visas where there will be extra incentives for students to go and study in regional areas, which will be very good for regional economies, then the ticket to permanent residency will mean being able to have maintain your provisional requirements of your visa to live in those areas. Now, that that is a very big incentive. When people come to Australia on those visas and there is a requirement for them to be in particular places, and it can be all over the country. It's not in one particular area. And if there are no jobs in those places, they won't go there. They will go where there are jobs and where places and cities are looking for them to come. I mean, Adelaide, Arana, Kalgoorlie, Darwin, Warrnambool - all of these places have been telling us that they actually want to see more people and there'll be opportunities for them to go there and where they take up those visas, whether they're state sponsored or whether they're under the new visa forms we're announcing today, then that will provide them with a better pathway towards permanent residence. So it's done through incentive, that's where it's done.

LANE: All right. Prime Minister we're out of time. Thank you very much.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much Sabra.


ALAN JONES: The Prime Minister is on the line, Prime Minister good morning.

PRIME MINISTER: Good morning Alan.

JONES: Firstly PM, Erdogan, the Turkish President. Do you have a comment on that?

PRIME MINISTER: I do. First of all I'll be calling in the Turkish Ambassador today to make my remarks directly to him. But I find the comments obviously, offensive. Deeply offensive. But also I think very unhelpful because Australia and New Zealand, we have both absolutely, unconditionally condemned the terrorist attack in Christchurch. We have reached out and provided every support to the Muslim community both here in Australia and in New Zealand. Australia and New Zealand are models of tolerant societies for people from all around the world.

Now I find President Erdogan’s comments very much at odds with what Ataturk said -

JONES: Correct.

PRIME MINISTER: That our son’s could lie safely on their shores and rest in peace there. I find it a violation of that as well. So this is all - you know I think it's our job here Allan, not to escalate this.

JONES: True.

PRIME MINISTER: It is our job to take the temperature down, that's what tolerant societies do. I find the comments very regrettable and unhelpful. Perhaps, he's a member of the G20, I hope he will join with me in addressing issues around social media when it comes to terrorist attacks. Because social media platforms have been weaponized by terrorists of all influences around the world. Hopefully he can join in constructive initiatives working together with ourselves and New Zealand on that.

JONES: Okay. To come back to this immigration thing, 160,000. Many people would say Prime Minister that that’s about where it is at the moment. Do you think – right, 160 so you're not really making too much of a change at all and the fact that you say it won’t alter any kind of Budget appropriations indicates that it’s already there. But do you think the people of Sydney in particular and Melbourne will feel any difference in terms of what you're saying today? And if so when?

PRIME MINISTER: Well they'll start feeling that in terms of how the intake is done from 1 July this year. Because it's not only what the overall number is - which is the cap of 160,000 - but it's about where people are being encouraged to go. So this is about ensuring that there is less pressure on big cities like Sydney and Melbourne, where there are real population pressures which are frustrating people getting home on time and safely, to be with the kids, help with homework, as well as tradies being able to get on site. You don't get for paid sitting in a traffic jam. So, it’s about encouraging people to go out outside the big cities. So that includes Adelaide, it includes Darwin, it includes Newcastle

JONES: How do you get them to stay there?

PRIME MINISTER: Well the points test will give them incentives if they want permanent residence to remain in these locations. Everyone who comes on a provisional visa, they want the permanent residence. To get the permanent residence, you'll have to comply with the terms of your visa. But equally the states and territories will be given more places under the current program. They'll go from less than a fifth, to more than a quarter. That will give them a greater say about how many more people are coming into the states and territories.

So I think this is a very balanced plan Alan. It is one that deals with infrastructure which is the real issue that needs to be addressed. You've talked about things like fast rail, but the congestion-busting road projects we're putting right across the country, the road investments we're making out around Western Sydney International Nancy-Bird Walton Airport, all of these programs are designed to try and relieve the burden on our big cities, while realising the opportunities outside our big cities.

JONES: Okay. Just to use language that people can understand, the number of permanent residents is what you're talking about here. So all the Department of Home Affairs has to do, is to reduce the number of permanent resident stamps. That's fine and you're talking 160,000 and it's very easy to understand. But wouldn't you concede that many of the future permanent residents are already here? I mean some of them are partners of citizens. Some of them are partners of permanent residents. They have a right to permanent residence, it’s just a matter of when. So is the permanent intake the one that counts? Because there are many people here who will increase the population as a result of the fact that they here and will be able to secure permanent residence and they aren’t part of the 160,000?

PRIME MINISTER: Ultimately, to have a permanent visa, they would have to be in the 160,000, that includes family visas and those visas – which are about 45 or 47 odd thousand a year at the moment. There is no change to that, that will continue. But 70 per cent of the migration program will continue to be on skills. This is a very important issue, having skills be the dominant form of migration to the country, that's what actually grows the economy.

I remember back when John Howard came into power, after Paul Keating, the percentage of that migration program that was skilled was round about 30 per cent. 30 per cent and now we've got it up to 70 percent.

JONES: 70 per cent, right.

PRIME MINISTER: That is very important. It's really adding value and because migration does, migrants have added value, of course, to our country. So I'm disappointed with the comments of Michael Daly in New South Wales.

JONES: Oh forget him, forget him.

PRIME MINISTER: They were appalling comments on the contribution of Asian immigrants to Australia. Bill Shorten should denounce it.

JONES: He's no worry to you. Just tomorrow though, are you going to be undermined in a way because - unless you've got a bit of an insight, I'm sure as Prime Minister you most probably have - because these net overseas migration figures come out tomorrow. It'll count everyone who is here for 12 months out of the last 16, net overseas migration. It's been running at massively high levels of over 200,000 net overseas migration figures. What happens if tomorrows figures are even higher?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, it would only reinforce the need for the plan that we've announced today. But you're right to say that temporary migration has had a very big impact on the level of population growth. And I've been making I've been making that point for a long time. I mean, if you think about a bus and there's 10 extra people on the bus, well four extra people on the bus coming in a year were born here about - just under that actually - a bit over four have come as temporary migrants who seek to move to permanent residence, and the balance two are permanent migrants. So that's basically how the inflow of population works.

JONES: Yeah but I mean, you've got 500,000 international students, 500,000 international students. My God.

PRIME MINISTER: And let me say in this plan we've announced today we're providing incentives for those students to actually go and study in regional areas by giving them an additional a year of work rights.

JONES: But supposing they get the permanent residency, supposing they get... just half of them get permanent residency.

PRIME MINISTER: I know but Alan that has to come in them as 160,000 cap. That's how these two things work together. So the issue if you think about, it the impact of what our international student industry and our tourist industry obviously is massively important for our economy it creates a lot of regional jobs. So you've got more of those students who are coming in choosing to study in regional areas or places like Adelaide or Darwin and things like that. That is going to support those economies and it's going to remove congestion pressure off Sydney and off Melbourne. So the real design of this plan is to focus not just on what the total level of intake is but where people are encouraged to go.

JONES: OK good. I won't talk to you today about the infrastructure because that's part of where they will go to settle. You talk about Melbourne to Shepparton and Sydney to Newcastle and so on…

PRIME MINISTER: We'll have more to say about that.

JONES: Quite. But could I just say on that, the notion that we want to get people out of the capital cities, a most laudable notion. The elephant in the room, Prime Minister, surely is water. If you harvested water, if you built dams, if you moved water to regional Australia you could increase productivity dramatically and not only would there be a capacity to live in the regions, people would be happy to live there and you increase the productive quotient in Australia. So in infrastructure, when are you going to harvest the water, move the water and build some dams?

PRIME MINISTER: Well we're building one at Hughenden.

JONES: Not enough.

[Laughter]

PRIME MINISTER: I’ve been in the job for just over six months, one of the first thing that it was we we got this dam project underway up in Hughenden. We've got a half a billion dollar water fund which is designed to get a lot of these projects moving. So look I don't agree… sorry I do agree, I should say, with the idea that we need to get this water infrastructure. One of the other things that…

JONES: You could feed Asia, you could feed Asia, people would willingly live west of the Great Dividing Range and the quality of life if they knew they weren't going to be immersed and surrounded and enveloped by drought. And we have to guarantee water. Harvesting does that.

PRIME MINISTER: Agreed.  

JONES: OK, one other thing because we're both running out of time here. I'm just wondering whether you would, because governments interfere and intervene notions they interfere. Intervene often in issues of great crisis. I'm putting to you the dairy industry is in crisis. Now, Coles and Aldi have said, ‘oh well we'll lift the price for home brand milk’ and so on. The problem is not at the retail level. Prime Minister. The problem is at the farm gate. Now at the moment there's a drought on. That means the cows produce less milk. The price of food goes up, the hay and the grain goes up and the processors, mostly foreign owned, are screwing the dairy farmer. Now, I know you're going to call people in over social media and well done about that and say listen there's got to be some responsibility along with the profits. But why wouldn't you call these processors in and say look, enough is enough. I've seen it all. You're not going to continue to rip off the dairy farmer. You have to renegotiate the farm gate price so that the cost of production is not greater than the price he's getting for his milk. Forget Coles and Woolworths. They're not the problem.

PRIME MINISTER: Well as you already noted there has been sort of movement on this as we've seen reported today. And I think that's well…

JONES: That’s Coles and Woolworths, that’s not farm gate prices. These people are on contracts. The ACCC have said these contracts that have been entered to by the poor dairy farmer are extortionate. Why doesn't someone speak to the processors and say you can't go on like this. If you can't regulate yourself, we will.

PRIME MINISTER: Well I think that's a fair point to be made to them and this is what David Littleproud and I will continue to do with those very producers and the ACCC as you rightly say should have an important role in that because they have the power to move prosecutions in these cases. And remember, it was our Government that introduced the effects test. That was introduced by our Government which actually started to level the playing field between the big companies and whether they be, you know, the big milk producers or others, the wholesalers or the retailers. The milk code conduct, the dairy code of conduct, that is someone with already taken action on. And we've been doing that into partnership with industry. But I do know the frustrations. I was down in the seat of Gilmore the other day I heard it loud and clear, so there is a lot more work to do on that front and David Littleproud and I will continue to progress that.

JONES: OK, good. I'll let you go. But it isn't fair, is it, to put it in very simple language, PM. Supposing you're a dairy farmer, you are working all hours of the day and night. It's an important industry. It’s on our breakfast table every day. The Tasmanian farms have already been sold to Canada to China. So what we've got left we've got to look after. Now, why would we say to any Australian that the price of your commodity will be less than the cost of providing it? And farmers are desperate. We're talking suicide and everything here, PM. I mean, they're looking to you just say - you said at Gilmore - I understand it, these are foreign owned processors, I'm going to pull them in and say something's got to be done.

PRIME MINISTER: Well there's a lot more work to be done on that. There's no doubt about that.

JONES: Can you report to us on what progress you will be able to make.

PRIME MINISTER: Yes I will.

JONES: Good on you. Good to talk to you, thank you for your time.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks Alan.PRESS CONFERENCE CANBERRA ACT


PRIME MINISTER: Well good afternoon, I’m pleased to be joined by Minister Coleman and Minister Tudge. This is a very important day, because today we are launching Australia’s first Commonwealth serious plan to manage population growth into our future.

This plan is about protecting the quality of life of Australians right across our country, in our urban areas, in our regional parts of the country. Its about realising the economic opportunities that are all around the country and it’s about investing in the fabric of our community so we can grow together. At a very practical level, it’s about acknowledging the impacts that are happening in our cities and the opportunities we need to seize in our regional areas. Its about understanding that parents want to get home sooner and safer to have time together as a family. The tradies want to spend less time in traffic and more time on site, because that’s where you get paid and to ensure that the congestion that is impacting on our cities is addressed – not just now but that it’s well-,managed into the future. That congestion and the liveability of cities was one of the key items that was highlighted by the Productivity Commission in the report into the five year priorities for productivity improvements that I commissioned when I was Treasurer.

So today’s announcement is about addressing that productivity agenda as well. Our population has been a key component of our economic growth. Equally that population if not well-managed can retard growth, that is true, with the impacts of congestion. So it is very much about getting the balance right across these various objectives. The plan that I announce today, supported by Ministers Coleman and Tudge, has four key components.

The first is ensuring that we have a responsible and well-planned and targeted migration programme. A programme that of course, has integrity and that programme will be capped at 160,000. That programme enables us to pause at that level over the forward estimates, but as always the Government has the opportunity to respond to changing circumstances in the future. But it about the forwards, it is about ensuring that the population planning and the infrastructure investments and the working out of the plan that I’m outlining today with Ministers, is able to have it’s effect across the country. It’s about incentives, to get people taking up the opportunities outside our big cities and I know much of the discussion is focussed on regional areas but these ‘outside the big cities’ areas include Adelaide, they include Darwin, they include Hobart, they include Newcastle, they include some of our faster growing areas around the country. It’s important that we have the opportunity for people to go where they are needed. Over 45,000 job vacancies in regional Australia, as Alan reminds me regularly, constantly, for rural and regional areas and have been put to the government, through the migration programme and the need to have more workers in those areas. So it’s important that we take the opportunity for our migration programme to play its role in seizing those opportunities.

Secondly it’s about busting congestion in our cities and ensuring that our cities are well-managed. There are an array of initiatives there, whether it’s the City Deals, the most recent we announced yesterday in Adelaide, or it’s the congestion-busting infrastructure projects, or the very large scale projects like the Tullamarine Rail or the North South Rail Link we’ve recently announced in western Sydney to support the Western Sydney International Nancy Bird Walton Airport, these are important projects. It's about planning for the future together, with state and territory and local governments.

As you know, last year I took a new approach to population planning, to work closely with the states and territories, to the COAG meeting. That was endorsed at that COAG meeting and we continue to work together on that framework. That includes importantly, working with local government. As you know, the ALGA was part of that COAG meeting and welcomed that approach to acknowledge the challenges being faced by local governments across the country. Under this plan, particularly on the migration programme, as David will run through later the states and territories will go from having just less than a fifth of a say about the annual migration intake into their states, to almost a third. So that is giving them a real role in the migration programme in Australia, that they have never had before.

Finally it's about continuing to invest in bringing Australians together. A cohesive society, one where we invest in the social fabric of this country, is one that enables us to support population growth into the future. It is one of Australia's most significant successes. Sure, we can always do more and we can always do better, but Australia is a country that welcomes people from all around the world and our social cohesion and our migration programme makes us the most successful migrant country in the world today. We will not take that for granted and what we're announcing today will further invest in the social fabric as part of a comprehensive plan.

 

So a responsible migration plan, busting congestion in our cities, planning to grow together and bringing Australians together to invest in our social fabric; that is the serious plan, the Plan for Australia's Population Future, that we're announcing today.

I'm going to ask Minister Tudge to go through some of the data. I know how much you'd like me to take you through data charts from Treasury days - Shane is giving the nod of approval - but I'm going to allow Alan to do that today, to run through the data that has really contributed to the strategy that we've come forward with today and talk about the particular infrastructure components of what we're announcing today. Then I'll ask David to go through the more detailed components of the migration changes that we're making today. So, I'll hand you over to Alan, thank you.

THE HON ALAN TUDGE MP, MINISTER FOR CITIES, URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND POPULATION:   Thanks Prime Minister. This is a plan to ease the pressure on our big cities, while supporting the growth of the smaller cities and the regions. We've been working on this for many months now and I'd like to take you through at least some of the analysis which has underpinned where we have actually got to. I hope this presentation works, if I press this button, it should come on. That one there, there we go.

Let's start by looking at this. Australia's population is growing fast, but it's always been a relatively fast-growing nation. We're at about 1.6 per cent per annum presently, which is the average since Federation. But clearly you can see we've had faster-growing periods of time in the Populate or Perish policy and also in the Roaring ‘20s. We've had an up-tick in particular in the last decade or so, so we're still going along at a reasonably fast pace of 1.6  per annum, which is double the rate of the United States and almost triple that of the OECD average.

When you look at population growth, there's really only two ways you can grow; through natural increase, because we're having more babies and living longer, which we are doing, and through net overseas migration. We've always been a land of immigrants and so immigration has always been a big part of our population growth. In recent decades, the proportion of our population growth which is due to immigration has actually lifted. So it now sits close to about 60 per cent with about 40 per cent due to births and increasing life expectancy.

Now, this is perhaps one of the more important slides, that while the growth of Australia is relatively quick by international standards, it's particularly fast into three areas; that is in to Melbourne, Sydney and south east Queensland. There, as you can see they're represented by these three bars here, they constitute three-quarters of all of the population growth in the country overall. So those three cities, those three areas, are growing very, very fast, while these other areas, which are growing much more slowly, when in fact want to grow more quickly. In many cases, they're crying out for more people.

The Prime Minister indicated previously that in the regions alone, there are 47,000 job vacancies today, according to the Regional Australia Institute. We know that a place like Adelaide, which is down here, the Premier wants 15,000 to 20,000 more people each and every year. There are parts of Australia where which are literally crying out for more workers. So while we've got very fast growth in the big cities, we've got other parts of the country that do want to grow more quickly. Here's just one indication in Warnambool, in my home state of Victoria, this is the Warnambool Mayor who says they need 1,000 workers today to fill the job vacancies which they have. That's three or four hours outside of Melbourne, a beautiful coastal town.

So moving along, when you've got fast-growing population, you need infrastructure to keep up. Now, this chart tracks the infrastructure expenditure with what the population growth is. As you can see, it broadly tracks. So the red line there is the infrastructure expenditure. The dark blue line is the population increase and basically they largely track each other. Although, you'll see at times - and particularly here, which is sort the mid-2000s to late-2000s, the population did grow well in excess of what the infrastructure expenditure was. Interestingly here we have a big up-tick in recent years. That is largely due to the massive investment going on in New South Wales where the Berejiklian Government has done enormous amounts of public infrastructure work there. Of course, very strongly supported by our Coalition Government here federally as well. So while generally it's kept pace there have been moments when it hasn't kept up and of course this is expenditure which doesn't always mean the roads are there, built, ready to be used, sometimes there can be a lag still of a couple of years thereafter.

Now, what happens if you've got fast-growing populations with the infrastructure not necessarily keeping up? Well, you end up with serious congestion and the data backs up what everybody in Melbourne, Sydney and south east Queensland particularly know from daily experience; that is the roads and the rail are getting more and more congested. So here is just one piece of data, when you look at the Melbourne traffic times. A decade ago, you could be assured of travelling 30km on the freeway in the morning peak hour and it would take you 39 minutes. A decade later, that's almost taking you an hour. So the freeway speeds is one marker of congestion and they've slowed down considerably and there's some roads, such as the Monash in Melbourne, which are almost a carpark every single morning. That translates of course, into a serious economic cost as well, which the Prime Minister mentioned. You can see that we've had congestion costs rising steadily in recent years and on the forecasts, if we do nothing different, it would continue to go up quite, quite heavily according to what the experts would suggest.

Now another part of this equation as well is if you've got strong population growth which is not being managed well, is that the housing approvals and completions don't always keep up. This is an important chart and what it shows is the ratio of dwelling completions to population change. If you're above the red line, you're basically building more houses than population coming in. If it's below the line, the contrary, your housing developments are not keeping up with your population increase.

Now, guess what happens if your population increase is running ahead of what your dwelling completion is? Your prices spike and that is exactly what has happened of course, in the last decade or so. That’s just another feature of what occurs if you're not managing your population well and making sure you've got your population growth aligned with key services and key approval processes like housing approval and dwelling completions.

So that's just a quick snapshot, if you like, of some of the challenges of population growth. Now, we're going to flip to say, well, that doesn't necessarily mean that you put the brakes on. You've got to consider the opportunities which strong population growth brings and that is, it does help drive our economy.

Now, on this chart, the red line is the population growth on an index. The blue line is the real GDP per capita and this is often not, sort of, fully understood. Not only does population growth help with GDP growth overall, but it helps with GDP per capita growth too. So it's actually made all of us wealthier. In fact, Treasury estimates that 20 per cent of our per capita wealth generated over the last 40 years has been due to population factors. Now, how does that come about? Well, in part - I'll go to the next slide which sort of explains this - at least in part, because when we bring in migrants, they come in younger than what the average Australian is. On average, a migrant comes in at the age of 26. The average age of an Australian is about 37. So it very much helps with our workforce participation and that's essentially what is a big driver of our GDP per capita growth.

PRIME MINISTER: Just on that, I’d also mention, from a pensions point of view and social welfare point of view - achieving more of a balance in the working-age population means there's more people in the working age to actually pay for the pensions and the welfare bill for those who aren't able to be in the workforce. With an ageing population, that is one of the levers and policy measures you have available to you to address an ageing population.

MINISTER FOR CITIES, URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND POPULATION: So this has been really important. As you probably know, our Government has slightly reduced the age of coming in as well, because we know when people come in as skilled people, as young people, they immediately contribute to the economy and they help everybody else. The other side of the ledger here - so in some respects that talks about your participation rate staying high - this side of the ledger talks about our permanent migration programme and really goes to the fact that it supports our productivity as well. Because over time - and this started under John Howard - we've slowly increased the proportion of our overall intake to being geared very much around skilled migration. Those people that do come in, come in with skills which are higher than the average person of a similar age in Australia. So the population factors support our participation rates and they support our productivity. They also support, obviously, businesses being able to grow when they can't find Australian workers.

I'll go into the next slide, which is really the last slide which we'll show. So that in some respects, that analysis goes to where do we get to now in terms of our plan? This is a recap really of how the Prime Minister summarised overall. So there's four main elements to our plan. First up, reducing the migration cap and encouraging more migrants to go to the region and David is going to take us through the specifics on that. Busting the congestion, which goes with that. Working much more closely with the states and territories and bringing the communities together. So basically we're easing the pressure on the big cities and supporting the regions, we're investing heavily into those cities and elsewhere, while we've got the pause going on. Making sure we've got proper plans with the states and territories and the local councils so that these sort of problems are better managed in the future. And of course, continuing to invest to ensure we maintain a cohesive society.

David, I think you're going to go through the details, particularly around one and four, there's a lot of detail in relation to the specifics there. Let me just say very briefly in terms of just addressing number two and number three; we’re busting congestion with investment in our roads and rail, we've been doing a lot of that, particularly in the last couple of years. We've got a $75 billion national program we're investing not only in the major road and rail corridors, but also particularly in the last six months or so, investing in the real pinch points in suburbs across our big cities. Those pinch points are important because often you can spend as much time trying to get onto the freeway, as you can actual being held up on the freeway itself. So that's a very important part of this plan and we'll continue to do that sort of work. We've mentioned fast rail briefly in the documents which have been circulated. That will also be part of our population plan as well and of course that can help with the decentralisation agenda, if you connect fast rail to your orbital cities around the big capitals. We'll have more to say about that at a later time. This planning mechanism the Prime Minister kicked off with COAG, saying that we need to much more closely align the levers which we have at our disposal - which largely set the population growth rate - with the responsibilities of the states and territories, who have primary responsibility for the infrastructure, the housing approvals and the like. They need to be much more closely married together and also the states and territories are now having a bigger say over what the population and the migration settings should be.

Critically, under this as well is the City Deals mechanism, which are becoming very important mechanisms to tie the three levels of governments together, to be able to plan better for our bigger cities. Now, we just announced the Adelaide City Deal just yesterday. We've done other City Deals, particularly the Western Sydney one which is a great plan for the development of Western Sydney, to deal with some of these congestion pressures in advance and getting it right. We're also going to do one in south east Queensland over the next 12 months. So they're two elements of the plan. The real details are in number one and four and, David, I think it's over to you now to take us through some of those initiatives.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you, David and thank you Alan.

THE HON DAVID COLEMAN MP, MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS: Thanks, PM, thanks, Alan. Good afternoon, everyone. This migration plan is about acknowledging that different parts of Australia have different immigration needs. A one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate, because the immigration needs in Sydney and Melbourne are very different to the needs in South Australia or in Tasmania or in so many other parts of Australia where there is a real need for additional people to fill un-met demand for skilled jobs. So this is about focusing in on those needs around the country and seeking to ensure that our migration programme is matched to those needs and doesn't impose one solution across the entire nation.

So the first point as the PM noted, is that the annual migration cap will be coming down from 190,000 to 160,000. That, over the forward estimates, is a reduction of some 120,000 places. Now, that enables us to take some of the pressure off the cities that are experiencing, as Alan pointed out, some very significant pressures in terms of the congestion and so on. By reducing the total cap under the programme, we create the opportunity to reduce that pressure. Then, very importantly, what we further do is that we will ensure that a greater proportion of migrants settle in regional Australia.

It's really notable when you go round the country, the differences in the demand for migrants. I was just in South Australia this week and there is such a strong desire in South Australia for more people to fill the un-met demand for jobs and so on. That's the case in many other parts of the nation as well. So under this plan, what we will be doing is creating 23,000 places within the skilled scheme, where people will be required to live and work in regional Australia for a period of three years in order to obtain permanent residency. I just want to explain why this is a very important point; for people who emigrate to Australia, permanent residency is at the top of their priority list. It means that you can stay in the country and plan your future in this nation. So by linking the requirement that a person stays in a regional area for three years to their permanent residency, we will see a very, very high level of compliance with that requirement, because if people don't comply, they won't get permanent residency and they will not be allowed to settle in Australia. Now, at the moment, there is already a scheme under the state and territory nominated system which works in a similar way. About 8,500 people in 2017/18 were under this system, where they had to stay in a regional area for two years in order to obtain a permanent residency. Now, the compliance rate with that program, is 99 per cent. That's because permanent residency is such a powerful incentive.

So we're doing two things in expanding this concept of provisional permanent residency for regional Australia. The first is what is known as the employer-nominated scheme, currently known as the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme. Now, under that scheme there are about 6,000 places, there were about 6,000 places in 2017/18. We'll be increasing that to 9,000 places and we'll be requiring that people who come under that scheme, stay in a regional area for three years in order to obtain permanent residency.

The second significant change is in relation to the state and territory nominated program. As the PM mentioned, we'll be giving the states and territories the opportunity to increase the number of people that they nominate to come to their state. So that was 8,500 people in 2017/18 and that will be increasing to 14,000 people in 2019/20. So 23,000 people over all will be required to live and work in regional Australia if they want to obtain permanent residency. That means they will not be residing in Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane or the Gold Coast or Perth. So, importantly, that helps to take the population pressure off those centres.

Now, within regional Australia, it's important to understand that people are able to move around under this programme within regional Australia. So as I said, regional Australia excludes Sydney, it excludes Melbourne, it excludes Perth, it excludes Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Those individuals will not be able to settle in those locations. If they do, they will lose their visa and they will not be able to settle in Australia. We're also allocating $7 million to increase compliance with these regional rules. People will be required to advise the Department of Home Affairs if they change employers or move and most importantly, at the end of the three years,when they seek to obtain permanent residency, they would need to substantiate that they had, in fact, lived and worked in regional Australia for that period of three years. So some very strong compliance measures there which will ensure that people who come under those visas stay in regional areas and which will take the pressure off population growth in our big cities.

The other thing that it’s important to point out is that under this plan, there is no reduction in the number of places that can be nominated by employers. So part of our immigration programme, the permanent programme, is that employers can hire a specific individual where there is a skills gap in a particular region and that person can come to Australia.

Now, in 2017/18, there were 35,000 people who employers were able to sponsor into Australia. In 2019/20 that number is 39,000, so there's no reduction in the employer-sponsored programme. In fact, there is a modest increase.

The other thing I would also like to point out is there is no change to the family program. So in 2017/18, just under 48,000 people settled in Australia under the family program and the number in 2019/20 is precisely the same, so just under 48,000 people. So no change to the family program and obviously, people will settle right around the nation in relation to the family program.

So this is about ensuring that our migration programme is better matched to the needs of Australia. Our needs are different in different parts of the country. We know that Sydney and Melbourne in particular are facing very significant population pressures and we know that places like South Australia, Tasmania and other parts of Australia are literally calling out for more people.

So what this plan enables us to do is to deliver on those requests from different parts of Australia in relation to their migration intake. It enables us to importantly, take pressure off the cities.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you. Do you want to speak to the social cohesion programs, just briefly?

MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS: Sure. So over the past several months, the Government has been working on a package of social cohesion measures that are aimed to promote, encourage, celebrate multicultural Australia and tolerance within our community. Today we're announcing $71 million worth of measures in the social cohesion area, which we'll provide the full list of those later today. There are a few I wanted to specifically highlight as part of this announcement. One is a program called Together For Humanity. This is a really important program that sends people into schools to discuss religious difference, religious tolerance. It has been operating successfully for a number of years. It is so important as a society that we are cognisant and accepting of our differences. Religious freedom is so fundamental to this nation and Together For Humanity does a great job in helping people to understand religious difference and to promote tolerance. They'll be receiving $2.2 million under this program.

Another important initiative is community languages. It’s really important to note the significance of community languages in Australia, especially for kids. There are so many kids out there who do a community language after school, on the weekends. It helps to enable them to learn more about the culture that maybe their parents or grandparents have come from. Of course, there are other kids who learn languages that are not their background culture, but also enable them to learn more about the diversity of our nation. So we'll be providing $10 million in funding for Community Languages Schools for grants of up to $25,000 to assist in the development of these important programs.

In addition, we'll be having another round of the successful Fostering Integration Grants. These were just run quite recently, grants of up to $50,000 which again, seek to support organisations that are promoting tolerance, education and inclusion in our community. We'll be allocating an additional $3 million to that program as part of this announcement.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you very much, David. Just finally, also with student visas, we'll be extending an additional year of working rights for those who come under the international student visa program and study in regional areas, the areas that have been defined. This will do two things. One, it will bring, I think, a much needed boost to a lot of these regional communities with students going in with the spend. It is one of our biggest export earners as an industry and to see that benefit of that sector spread more into the regions will be positive, as well as taking the population pressure off. As I have said repeatedly, if there is ten extra people on the bus, just under four were born here, just over four have turned up on a temporary visa and two have turned up directly on a permanent visa. That's how population growth enters Australia. Over time that changes, of course, as people move on to other visa classes. So trying to manage also the temporary migration program and support that in its dispersal I think is important. In regional areas there is also 450 additional occupations that are available to regional employers that are not available in those other areas. So there are more opportunities under those regional visa schemes to achieve that. You're also very aware of what we do around the seasonal worker program and the working holiday-maker visa program to support the needs in regional areas as well and we’re going to continue to encourage that. Happy to take questions.

JOURNALIST: Just on the 23,000 skilled visas, under the current arrangement they stay for two years. What's the retention rate of people staying in the regions and do you have an estimate or a model of what extending it to three years will do to that retention rate?

MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS: A couple of points. So first point, there's two different programs. There's the state and territory nominated, which is currently 8,500. That goes to 14,000. The proportion of people who comply with that provision is 99 per cent. Obviously, once someone has spent a number of years in a regional area, it is reasonable to assume that the vast majority of those people will continue to settle in regional areas. Then we have the other program which is 6,000, going to 9,000, which is effectively does not currently have an effective regional requirement. So we have an additional 14,000 people who currently don't have a regional requirement in order to obtain permanent residency, who will. Permanent residency is top of the list in terms of the incentives for people. So we certainly expect that these will be well subscribed and that there will be a very high level of compliance.

PRIME MINISTER: Alan, did you want to add to that?

MINISTER FOR CITIES, URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND POPULATION: Yeah I would just note that the analysis we've looked at previously as well is after five years, more than 80 per cent of people are still in the regions, so who have chosen to go to the regions. People go make it their home, they go there, their kids go to school, they join the local soccer club, netball club, local church and make it their home and that’s what this plan is designed to do.

PRIME MINISTER: When you link up with states and territories and shires and local governments as well, when your migration plan is built around that, then your odds of success increase because you're taking people into areas where they want them to go, where the services are and where there are jobs.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Minister Tudge told us the importance of population growth to GDP growth and also GDP per capita but we're also told there's a 47,000 shortfall in regional skills. Why didn't you keep, say, the migration cap at 190,000 and use that extra 30,000 to bolster this program that has 23,000 regional skilled stream? If it's going to be successful why not keep it even bigger and perhaps fulfil that 43,000-person shortfall?

PRIME MINISTER: As you know, as a result of the improvements in our immigration systems in recent years, and it was shown in Alan's chart earlier, that the level of permanent residency granted under those permanent visas has fallen in recent years. So what we're doing is basically pausing at that level and redirecting the composition. Even at the levels and the targets that we've set now for people to go beyond the capital cities, we know that they are ambitious targets to meet for those areas. It is about pausing the overall level of intake and ensuring the spread of that intake is more targeted to where the jobs and the opportunities are.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the presentation…

PRIME MINISTER: You're waiting patiently there.

JOURNALIST: The presentation stepped through the contribution that migration has made to economic growth. Have you modelled the subtraction from economic growth that the reduction in the permanent residency program will have, and if so what is that number?

PRIME MINISTER: We're not expecting any change. That'll be set out in the Budget. As I said at the start of this process, and I should have stressed, when we stood up this process, we formed a Cabinet subcommittee which is chaired by the Treasurer, who is obviously not here today with us because he is busy writing the Budget. So I want to thank Josh for his work in leading the taskforce that the Ministers have been involved here. The whole point here is to do two things. Yes, to pause the overall level of permanent intake, which is basically running at those current levels on actuals. But also to address the impacts on the economy of congestion. There is population growing too quickly in parts of the country where there is too much congestion, which the Productivity Commission showed actually is a drag on productivity and is a drag on growth. That's why I described this as a serious but very balanced plan. So we can actually move to this level without impacting on the Budget and I think without impacting on growth and continuing to maintain the momentum of that growth.

JOURNALIST: So does the economic gain of reducing congestion offset the economic subtraction from reducing the intake?

PRIME MINISTER: The impact of this plan is to have no negative impacts on our growth prospects. Katharine.

JOURNALIST: Just on that regional-sponsored migration scheme, forgive me if this is not right - but I think it is right - there's 22,000 people currently in the pipeline for that scheme. So, if moving people to the regions is such a priority, why are those people in the pipeline, what’s going on. And just not on a point of policy but a point of logic, I know you've said to us that permanent residency is the carrot for moving people or requiring a three year residency rather than two. But it is a strange incentive, isn't it, to increase the time you have to be in the region in order to get permanent residency? It's not really an incentive, is it? It’s sort of… well, the hurdle is greater before you get permanent residency, which brings me back to the Prime Minister’s point which is that a minute ago, it’s an ambitious target for 23,000 right, for that cohort. So if you don’t meet your own target, what happens? Does the overall number under the permanent program fall?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, let me address those matters and David can comment on them also. First of all, just because someone has an application, it doesn't mean it'll be approved. There are lots of applications. What we have seen, particularly in recent years, is the integrity of our processes and the improvements in those mechanisms which Home Affairs has put in place, has meant that fewer of the applications have actually been approved. We have high standards and we'll continue to have those standards, and an application existing does not mean that that is a pending approval. And we'll continue to follow that path. In terms of the issue of two to three years, this is about having the opportunity for people to put further roots down over that period of time. And so, rather than, I think, being a disincentive, I think it only enhances the incentive for people to commit further to where they are locating and settle themselves and their families in the jobs they are in and seek further opportunities in those towns or wherever they may be, or in that city. The purpose of permanent residency is a very, very attractive one because of course it leads to citizenship, which is the ultimate club to be in and so we do not consider that as any impediment or any lack of encouragement. Remind me of your last point, Katharine?

JOURNALIST: You referenced a minute ago that 23,000 in relation to Andrew’s is a difficult benchmark to reach…

PRIME MINISTER: Remember, this is a cap. It is not a target. Just like 190,000 has previously been the cap, not the target. When I became Immigration Minister back in 2013, these things used to be targets. They tried to fill it. They used to try to find applicants to approve to meet the targets for the Immigration Department. Now, that changed. We changed that. As a Government, we changed that some years ago. So that means that it is there as a cap. It's there as a ceiling but the standard of applications that they have to meet is unchanged. And so, there are no performance bonuses for people to approve visa applications in the Department of Home Affairs. There's a simple standard. As part of this package there is investment in new systems also to support the visas that will be granted. And in particular there'll be enhanced visa processing for regional areas and a regional migration hub to undertake outreach activities, support regional employers and local authorities to navigate the visa system. We're also investing in the process of how people might see the region as an opportunity. But David, did you want to add?

MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS: A little while ago we $19 million in additional investment related to regional processing, a significant component is increased emphasis on regional processing. So basically to proritise regional processing. So what that means is that some of those people in that pipeline,  the ones who comply with the rules, will be processed more quickly, which will assist in achieving the target of 9,000. In relation to the 14,000, which is the second component of the regional target, so these roles are nominated by states and territories. As I mentioned earlier, we're in a discussion with the states and territories about their needs, in particular, locations. We estimate that that 14,000 number will be met through their requests. So we think the 23,000 can be achieved.

PRIME MINISTER: We'll go over here and then we'll come back to you.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you mentioned earlier there are a couple of election buses winding their way through New South Wales at the moment. How much of that election has put into your mind the timing of today's announcement?

PRIME MINISTER: None.

JOURNALIST: Nothing to do with what's going on in New South Wales?

PRIME MINISTER: No. We started this process last year. We stood the taskforce up soon after I became Prime Minister and I highlighted this as a very significant issue I wanted to address as Prime Minister. The end bookmark… the end mark on this is the Budget. That requires us to actually frame the migrant intake under the permanent program to be included in the Budget. The Budget's less than a fortnight away. So this was always the timeframe. Yes?

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just a particular interest for our audience. They're asking when you speak about compliance measures, what does that mean? Are we talking about a population police going door-to-door to check where people are staying, what does it look like? And migrants are quite concerned about how that might impact their experience in Australia. The second question if you’ll allow is the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia has said particularly given what has happened in Christchurch this week, it is irresponsible and erroneous to link congestion to migration. Can you reassure migrants they're not to blame for these challenges that we’re facing? We saw very clearly in slide six that government has not invested in infrastructure that is needed and it’s not their fault.

PRIME MINISTER: Sure. I'm happy to reassure them on that point. Australia's immigration program has been one of the most important pillars of our prosperity and success. And our migrant communities, from whichever part of the world they come from, it is just a consistent story of success. One of the things I enjoy doing most in this role and previous roles has been to attend annually, where I can, the Ethnic Business Awards, which now includes indigenous businesses. It is a true story of remarkable achievement and often times quite teary stories about what people have been able to achieve. Indeed, we've had a habit at each of these events to honour all of those who've created these amazing businesses over the course of their life. Migrant communities and migrants to Australia have a higher level of entrepreneurship and business ownership, self-employed work than other any other cohort of the country. The real success of Australia's immigration, and why I say we are the most successful immigrant country on earth, is because on all the key metrics - educational attainment, employment, small business ownership, when it comes to the justice system - all of these things, when you look at the migrant versus non-migrant population in Australia, it just achieves either at the same standard as the rest of the population or, indeed, for many communities, even better. So migration and those who have come to Australia to make a contribution, not take one, has been an enormous boon for Australia we want to continue to encourage that. You're right, it is about planning for population growth, which is what we're talking about today. As I said on Monday in my speech to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce, any conflation of this debate certainly with the terrorist atrocities last week, it's just not on. There's no connection between these things whatsoever. This is about dealing with practical issues. I expressed on Monday my great frustration that in addressing these issues of population, and immigration programs, that these debates so often get hijacked by those of competing views who seek to exploit them for other causes. Now, I reject all of that absolutely. This is a practical problem that Australians want addressed, that migrant communities wanted addressed. And so by ensuring we have both the migration programs that are responsible, the infrastructure programs that are responsible and forward-looking, and the planning processes that are inclusive, and the social cohesion programs which build on the success of our social fabric, well, that's all win.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, a number of your Queensland MPs have come out publicly today saying they don't want Pauline Hanson last on the ticket in Queensland. They think…

PRIME MINISTER: Can we finish talking about population? If people have questions on population policy issues - I'll deal with politics later. I'll deal with policy first. Shane?

JOURNALIST: PM, I'm just wondering 160,000? Why not 170,000? Why not 150,00, or lower? How did you come to 160,000? Is there modelling around 160,000?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes, there is. If we were to take the figure below 160,000, then that would have had a direct fiscal impact on the Budget. This is the nominated level where the program is constructed where we would not experience that impact on the Budget. So that's obviously sensible. It caps it, as we've talked about today, at a pause level, which is where the program has been directing. It has been at 190,000 for some time. I think it makes sense to take it back to the levels on or about that we've been projecting at and experiencing. So we have considered a range of options here and we think this is the most balanced and the most sensible.

JOURNALIST: Can you just explain how the states get a greater say? Is it simply by being able to nominate more migrants that they want coming to their state, or is it the way the states are engaging with the Commonwealth on this issue as well?

MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS: Alan, do you want to talk to the population aspects?

MINISTER FOR CITIES, URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND POPULATION:  The answer to question is both. So David will be able to talk about right now what's happening with the state-nominated scheme. More broadly, we're working through the COAG process where the states have a much greater role overall in setting up what the migration program should look like going forward. Ideally, as I said before, we need to make sure that you're marrying up your population growth rates, which largely we set through the migration settings, with your infrastructure, your housing approvals, your services and the like which the states and territories have primary responsibility for. They need to be completely in sync. If they're not in sync, you end up with some of the issues that we talked about where housing is not being approved in time, the infrastructure is falling behind, and the like. So that's what we're working on and the Prime Minister is leading that through the COAG process, and there's still more work to do on that.

PRIME MINISTER: We've had great support from the states and territories, but there is still more work to do. David?

MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS: In terms of the migration program, the process is that we ask the states what are their needs, for the state and territory migration program. We're basically saying, "Here's a significant increase to the allocations you'll be able to take on", and being very responsive to those requests from different states. So it is about working together and thinking about future of the country in terms of the broader migration program over a number of years.

PRIME MINISTER: Still on this topic?

JOURNALIST: What has been done to actually vet employers who want to sponsor migrants? In South Australia there was an example of one migrant who was currently waiting to find out about his future. He went to a regional city, being Murray Bridge. He worked for an employer who then ripped him off, about $7 an hour. He is now facing deportation because he wanted to provide for his family, got a new job. Obviously breaching his visa conditions, no doubt about that. What is being done to actually vet employers so they are suitable and we know they won't treat our migrants poorly?

MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS: Project Cadena has been running for some time which is focused on precisely that issue. And we also have recently the report by Professor Fels in relation to these matters and the bottom line is any behaviour of that kind is completely unacceptable, they are criminal offences and people are prosecuted, as they should be. The reality is, unfortunately, there has been exploitation in some industries. But Project Cadena is focused on going after those employers through Australian Border Force and we’ll continue to be.

JOURNALIST:  Just a question about compliance, what can migrants expect in terms of policing where they're living?

PRIME MINISTER: I'll let David mention that, speak to that. The point is here at the end of the day, there is a strong self-assessment process to this because people need to demonstrate where they have been. Through people’s own records, where their addresses have been and where their power bills are, and all of these sorts of things. Their employment records, their tax file numbers - all these sorts of things - we have a pretty reasonable understanding of where people have been and where they've been living. So the suggestion of some sort of walking the beat enforcement arrangement here is obviously ridiculous. That's certainly not what we have in mind. It is a far more, I think, practical and more cost-effective way of just working cooperatively.

MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS: Yes, and the bottom line is, at the end of the three years, when you want your permanent residency, you need to be able to substantiate that you lived and worked in regional areas. Permanent residency is, as I said, the absolute top priority. And so people have a very, very strong incentive to ensure that they comply or they won't get PR.

MINISTER FOR CITIES, URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND POPULATION:   This is not radically new either. We've already had some geographically restricted visas already. It is not a radically new concept here. It is expanding what we've been doing.

PRIME MINISTER:  On this topic, I haven't forgot you, Sam, don't worry.

JOURNALIST: So if a skilled migrant comes out, Minister Coleman, and ends up with a shonky employer for example who shifts away from, say, Bennellaland and goes to Kalgoorlie, then they’ll still be...

PRIME MINISTER: Well, Kalgoorlie is still within a regional location.

JOURNALIST: Yep, so as long as it's with regional -

PRIME MINISTER: Outside the big cities. To maintain the flexibility in that, I think is really important. Otherwise it becomes an unworkable program. I've very much appreciated the extensive questions on the policy topic. Sam?

JOURNALIST: OK, two questions. First is a number of Queensland MPs have said today they think you should always put One Nation last... put the Greens last, sorry, not One Nation. What's your thoughts on that? Will you been preferencing the Greens ahead of One Nation?

PRIME MINISTER: First of all, preferences, as you know, are determined by the party organisation. Secondly, our policy, which is unchanged - so this hasn't changed in recent days. It was the position stated by the former Prime Minister - we won't be doing deals with One Nation. It was actually the Labor Party at the last election that benefited from One Nation's preferences that elected members like in Dobell and Longman and other places. So I'm not about to take lectures from the Labor Party, particularly at the moment, when you have Michael Daley out there basically saying that Asian migrants are taking Australians' jobs in our cities. I denounce that statement like I'll denounce any other statement that is similar to that. I'm surprised Bill Shorten as yet hasn't disassociated himself. He is as far away from New South Wales as he could possibly be this week, he's over in Western Australia. If he goes any further he'll be in the ocean.

JOURNALIST: I don't think I got an answer to the question...

PRIME MINISTER: Our policy is not to do deals with One Nation.

JOURNALIST: My second question is, you described as a disgusting lie claims that at a 2010 shadow cabinet meeting that you sought to capitalise on anti-Muslim sentiment in the community. Now you’ve been backed by Greg Hunt on that.

PRIME MINISTER: On the record.

JOURNALIST: On the record, except the problem with that is Greg Hunt did not attend the meeting. Now those that did attend the meeting told the Sydney Morning Herald in 2011, quote, that Scott said, ‘What are we going to do about multiculturalism?’

PRIME MINISTER: Sam, I'm going to stop you there. I’ve already addressed this issue today. It is an ugly and repugnant lie, I reject it absolutely 100 per cent and my record of working with the Muslim community in Sydney in particular speaks volumes for my track record. Any suggestion to the contrary, I find utterly offensive. Thank you.



DOORSTOP NETHERBY, SA

NICOLLE FLINT, MEMBER FOR BOOTHBY: I’m Nicolle Flint, the Member for Boothby, and I’m really excited to have some very special guests here with me this morning. The Prime Minister of Australia, the Honourable Scott Morrison, Premier of South Australia Steven Marshall, Lord Mayor of the City of Adelaide Sandy Verschoor and my federal colleagues, Minister Alan Tudge, Minister Karen Andrews, and my candidate colleagues, Georgina Downer, Shaun Osborn, state colleagues, friends. We’re here at Urrbrae Agricultural High School for a couple of reasons. We’re talking about the incredible investment that the Marshall and Morrison Liberal Governments are making in science, in innovation and jobs for the future. We had a great announcement on the Space Agency yesterday and we’re also talking about how we are busting congestion for South Australians. We have 60,000 motorists going through the Fullarton Road cross road intersection every single day. We are busting congestion for over 60,000 motorists. This is great for my community, it’s one of the biggest issues people raise with me, is getting stuck in traffic, having trouble getting to work, getting their kids to school. But I’m also delighted that under the Morrison and Marshall Liberal Governments, South Australia is taking off. We are growing jobs, we are investing in science, we are investing in innovation, we are investing in our incredible arts community in South Australia and I’m going to hand over to the Premier to talk more about this very exciting announcement today. Premier.

THE HON STEVEN MARSHALL MP, PREMIER OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA: Thank you very much, thank you Nicolle. I just can’t wipe the smile off my face here in South Australia. It’s another very positive day for our state. We’re extraordinarily excited. This is a great City Deal, it will transform Adelaide, it will transform our state. And I think it demonstrates to everybody what a grown-up relationship with Canberra can actually deliver for our state. We’ve stopped to fake fights, and in fact what we’ve done is to sit down and work collaboratively on our ambition, our opportunity, for South Australia and we’ve developed a fantastic City Deal. A real partnership between the local government, the state government and the federal government coming together for a project which will really create great economic activity, increase visitation, increase international students and of course, as Nicolle says, bust some of the congestion on our roads. It’s a great deal, we’re very grateful to the Morrison Government for their support, we’re very grateful to the Adelaide City Council for their support. This is a great deal for our state. And now I’d like to introduce the Lord Mayor of Adelaide, Sandy Verschoor, elected in November last year. She has been working furiously with us at the state government, with Alan Tudge, the Federal Minister and the Prime Minister to deliver this deal for the people of Adelaide. But more broadly, the people of our state. Sandy.

SANDY VERSCHOOR, LORD MAYOR OF ADELAIDE: Thank you Premier and thank you Prime Minister. It is really significant when three tiers of government work together to deliver for our city and for our state. And for the city, the impacts of the investment in Lot Fourteen are going to be seen and felt right across the CBD and out to metropolitan Adelaide. The City of Adelaide is also pleased to be investing in the smart technology and the infrastructure that we need so that there is… so that the work that comes out of Lot Fourteen can also actually find a way into the city as it grows and actually we’ve got all of those things in terms of CCTV and smart lighting and ten gig fast internet connections for all of the businesses in that corridor.

THE HON STEVEN MARSHALL MP, PREMIER OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA: Well said. And now the Prime Minister.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you Steven, thank you Sandy, thank you Nicolle. And to my colleagues who are here, there is quite a collection of us here today because what’s happening here today I think is very exciting for the future of Adelaide. We’ve just been meeting with students, young students here at this amazing agricultural high school. It’s been here since the 1930’s, when it was established there was a  vision attached to that and that vision is being realised here for all of those years since and that vision is being kept alive here today by what we’re here to announce.

The vast majority of Australians live in cities all around the country and the quality of life they enjoy living in those cities depends on how we manage the growth of those cities and population in those cities. This is a city that has tremendous growth ahead of it, tremendous opportunities, and that’s being realised by Steven Marshall as Premier with his exciting plans and working together with the Lord Mayor to see those plans realised here. I mean, the turnaround we’ve seen in South Australia in the past year, Premier, is tremendously exciting. Another turnaround state under a Liberal government. We’ve seen it in Tasmania, we’re seeing it here in South Australia and we’ve certainly seen it in my home state of New South Wales under the Berejiklian Government and the Liberal government there.

And so today’s announcement is all about our commitment to making our cities liveable. To ensuring that our cities have the opportunities for those who live in those cities. And the big challenge we have to manage is how we manage population growth. That’s what it’s about - people stuck in traffic jams, ensuring there are jobs into the future, ensuring there is the skills that are being developed and the opportunities that are being realised. And the City Deal we’ve announced here and signed today in Adelaide, a $551 million deal, is about investing in the cultural life in this city. In the arts precinct, recognising the tremendous living indigenous culture that is so alive and is so celebrated here in South Australia. But it’s about science, and Karen Andrews is with me here today and she has been as excited as I have to be talking to those young women who are engaged in science and see their future in science. The space agency that we were here for lift off with the Premier not that long ago and the investments we’re making in that science and that Space Centre here. The investment in the innovation hub, all of this bringing together a beating heart of this city which is not just about culture, but it’s about science and the future and it’s about jobs.

But it’s also why we’re standing here at this intersection. An intersection which keeps mums and dads and tradies and others away from the places they need to be sooner and safer. And so we’re investing $61 million here into this intersection just behind us at Fullarton Road with the widening of that road. These are the practical things you have to do to make our cities liveable. These are the practical projects which are identified by our great local members on the ground and I want to commend Nicolle Flint for the great work she has done working with Alan Tudge to ensure we’re getting the projects right. This is part of a billion dollar congestion busting fund that I announced in last year’s Budget and we’ve been rolling these projects out all around the country. So when you think about this intersection here of Cook and Fullarton Roads and you think about why have the Marshall and Morrison Governments come together to address that particular project and even talk about it on a day like today as part of a much bigger deal? It's because the simple projects like this are the things that make the big difference to people's daily lives. So you can get home sooner to spend time with your families, so you can get on site because you don't get paid as a tradie to sit in a traffic jam. These are the things that make a practical difference.

So yes, it's a very big deal at $551 million. But it's also I think a very practical deal because it goes right down in the detail of the things that we know can slow South Australians down. Under Premier Marshall, he's speeding things up for South Australians. They want to see more people here in South Australia and particularly in the city of Adelaide and see their dreams realised. And so he's leading that charge and we are backing South Australians in for a very bright and exciting future. I’m going to throw to Alan now, Tudge, who's going to talk a bit more about the componentry of this deal and then I'm going to ask Karen Andrews as Minister for Industry and Science to talk a bit about the implications there nationally. Thank you Alan and congratulations.

THE HON ALAN TUDGE MP, MINISTER FOR CITIES, URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND POPULATION: Thank you Prime Minister, Premier, colleagues. This is a landmark deal for the next decade and beyond that really will transform Adelaide. Now, as the Prime Minister and the Premier have said, this is a $551 million deal. It consists of a number of components and I want to take you through that, particularly where the federal money is going. But let me say that this is the seventh city deal that we have negotiated now. And frankly there is no better deal that we have negotiated. There's nine - there's two more which are underway - we've just announced a South East Queensland one just last week and we will be negotiating one for that as well.

But each deal has its own special themes and in relation to the Adelaide City Deal, there's really three themes which are captured. First is creating jobs through innovation. And that's largely led by the Premier in Lot Fourteen and we're contributing more to that as well of course. Now, in that we're contributing to a new innovation hub. We're contributing to other elements down there as well at Lot Fourteen. I'd also point out though that it's important that it's an inclusive growth there too, and so I've got $3 million set there for an indigenous business hub so that Aboriginal people can capture the opportunities which will be created just as well as anybody else can.

The second major theme is population planning and growth. And again there's a number of components to that. We're considering what's called a Designated Area Migration Agreement which would basically be a boutique arrangement to support the population growth here. We've also got an entrepreneurs visa, which is a special visa just for South Australia. That's underway, we've got our first applicants already in. And we're also, as the as the Premier and the Lord Mayor have committed to as well, is reviewing and outlining a planning system for the next 20 years and beyond, both planning for greater densification in strategic areas but also for transportation over the next 20 years. That's the second theme.

And then the third theme is boosting the cultural economy. Now, everyone around Australia knows that Adelaide is one of the culturally great cities in Australia and this Deal will make it even better. The signature elements of that is the new indigenous arts and the new indigenous gallery and culture centre. Now, it will become a world renowned Aboriginal art gallery based right here in Adelaide opposite the Botanical Gardens. But we've also got a number of other elements which are included in this package as well, and Nicolle Flint has really spearheaded those particular elements to ensure that we continue to make this a great destination for tourists. Because when tourists come here, they bring money and that means more jobs for everybody. So it's a tremendous deal for South Australia. I'd like to thank the Premier. I'd like to thank Nicolle Flint and I'd like to thank Sandy Verschoor for negotiating this particular Deal which I think is a very good one.

I'll just finally just finish in terms of what we're announcing specifically on congestion busting as well. The Prime Minister mentioned that we've got a billion dollar Urban Congestion Fund which we are rolling out across the nation. We have allocated $97 million of that Fund to Adelaide for three particular projects. The first project we announced just a week ago, the Premier and I did. The second and third projects we are announcing today, one of which is directly behind us with the Fullarton Road intersection just right here. Now, I think everyone across Adelaide knows the type of congestion that intersection brings. And this funding, $49 million, half federal, half state, will fix that bottleneck for 60,000 people who use it every single day. We've also got a further project which is the widening of the Portrush Road on the approach to Magill road and there's $49 million which is going in to that as well. Again, 50/50 split and that supports of course the other third project being the Springbank Road project which we announced just the other day.

So we're busting congestion, we're planning for growth, we're supporting new industries such as the Space Centre, and we're boosting tourism into this great country, into this great city and I would like to thank again the Premier, the Lord Mayor and the other mayors which have been involved in this and just say this is a great day for Adelaide and a great day for the country.

THE HON KAREN ANDREWS MP, MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Thank you. This morning at Urrbrae Agricultural College we had the opportunity to meet with some of the amazing students who are studying agriculture but are immersed in science, technology, engineering and maths. And it's very clear from talking to them that they understand the importance of those subjects for their own future. So whilst they're clearly focused on ag, they understand science and tech in particular and the importance that it is to agriculture. We were talking about drones and the impact on agriculture. That's all part of the tech space but it's where tech and agriculture merge together. We talked about their hopes for the future, we met some budding vet scientists, we met some just amazing students and interestingly here at this College we have about 50 per cent girls and boys studying the STEM subjects which is outstanding and I am pretty sure is leading the way for Australia. So science, technology, engineering and maths are essential to our future because we know that 75 per cent of the jobs of the future will require those skills. So here at Urrbrae, they're making a great start on the future of their students by ensuring that those subjects are available and that they're nurturing and growing those students. And of course, agriculture is a real growth opportunity for Australia to lead the world and continue on that pathway in developing jobs, but in developing technology and innovation.

And of course it is not possible to come to South Australia and not talk about space. So space in Australia is currently worth about $3.9 billion to our economy and employs about 10,000 people. In the next 10 to 11 years, the Federal Government is intending to grow the space industry in Australia to $12 billion with an additional 20,000 people working in that sector. And of course here in South Australia this is where the Australian Space Agency is going to be headquartered at Lot Fourteen, the innovation headquarters right here in in Adelaide. Space Agency is already on its way here to South Australia. We've made some announcements about how we're going to expand the presence of space here in South Australia, working with the South Australian Government. But I think it's important to realise that there has already been a significant commitment of dollars into space by the Federal Government and I'm talking in the order of about $300 million for space. So we have committed to look at ways to improve our locational accuracy currently in Australia. Our accuracy for location is about five to ten metres. The Commonwealth is funding research to make sure that we bring that down firstly to a ten centimetre accuracy and then in metropolitan areas to bring that accuracy down to a three centimetre location. That is so important as we move towards autonomous vehicles because we need that accuracy as close as we possibly can. We're also looking at Earth observation and that's going to be so important to agriculture as well so that we can see where the rivers are, where the water is, where the best lands are going to be that we can future develop our agricultural base here in Australia. All of that is happening with space and it's so wonderful to see such a strong commitment from the Federal Government being supported by the South Australian Government here. And I know that if we keep working together, if we develop space, if we develop innovation and we've got that headquartered at Lot Fourteen, we will continue to grow and develop our space sector, provide more jobs for the future while inspiring our kids to look towards the stars and to aim high.

PRIME MINISTER: Well thank you Karen. Very exciting things happening. I want to thank again the Premier and the Lord Mayor for working together on delivering this deal today. This is what happens when state and local and Commonwealth governments work together. That has been the real, I think, transformation that's been taking place here in South Australia, we've seen it in other places. I'm happy to work with every Premier and mayor in the country to get things done and we're certainly getting things done with this great team here in South Australia. Happy to take questions. Let's focus on the City Deal first and happy to take other questions.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, is it any coincidence the congestion busting at this exact spot directly benefits Boothby, Mayo and Sturt, Boothby particularly?

PRIME MINISTER: Well as Alan just said, fixing this intersection improves the lives of many, many people from right across Adelaide. This is one of the hub points. I mean, there are 60,000 vehicles that go across this every day. So this is an important congestion busting project for Adelaide and this is why we've selected this project. It's come from the direct engagement that great local members like Nicolle Flint have had with their communities. So we're about responding to the needs of the community and that's what this investment is doing. It's going to benefit people right across Adelaide and I think that's a great thing.

THE HON ALAN TUDGE MP, MINISTER FOR CITIES, URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND POPULATION:  Can I add, Prime Minister, it's a bit like the largest single commitment here in South Australia is of course the North-South Road. That’s actually $3 billion which cuts right across South Australia, right across Adelaide, so it benefits absolutely everybody. And these small congestion busting projects compliment those major infrastructure projects.

JOURNALIST: Well the point that I'm making - I reckon in the last week I've seen more of Nicolle Flint than I've seen in my own wife.

PRIME MINISTER: That's because she's such a hard working member doing such a great job.

JOURNALIST: But it just seems to be you’re trying to shore up Boothby at all costs.

PRIME MINISTER: What I'm doing is I’m responding to the needs of people who live in Adelaide, and that's what Nicolle is doing and I make no excuse for that. We are out here to make it very clear that a re-elected Morrison Government will continue to deliver for people right across South Australia, working closely with the Marshall Government. That's what's on offer. And if you don't have Nicolle Flint as the Member for Boothby, then you won't have a government that's focused on South Australia at a federal level. You won't have a government that is lowering taxes for South Australians, so they can not only earn more and keep more of what they earn. You won't have a government, if Nicolle Flint is not re-elected in Boothby, you won't have a government that is going to protect retirees. You'll have a Labor government that is going to steal the money from thousands of retirees by taking away their franked dividend credits. So yes, it is very important that Nicolle Flint is re-elected in Boothby, because that is essential to ensure that our government can continue to deliver the strong economic management that millions of Australians rely on and, importantly, they rely on so we can fund the essential services, whether it's health here in South Australia, or schools, all at record funding levels coming out of the Commonwealth Government. Over 2,000 medicines now listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That doesn't happen by accident. It happens as a result of good economic management and Nicolle Flint, as the Member for Boothby, is critical to us being re-elected to ensure that we can deliver for South Australia. So make no mistake, Nicolle Flint is critical to the government's re-election and that's why I'm here today to ensure that we're delivering on the needs of South Australians and particularly those who live in the city of Adelaide.

JOURNALIST: Exactly how will you deliver regulation of social media?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I've written... are there any other questions on the City Deal? I'm happy to talk about all of those other issues today.

JOURNALIST: Just quickly on the DAMAs, how important is it for the DAMAs to go through for South Australia, the specific ones? Because this whole deal is about getting skilled workers. Is it fair to say that the DAMAs just have to happen?

PRIME MINISTER: The DAMAs are a very important part of population management in Australia. There are cities like Adelaide and states like Adelaide, as the Premier constantly reminds me, that are very happy and keen to see greater growth here in South Australia. There are other states like in New South Wales and Victoria, and South East Queensland, where the population growth has been impacting on the quality of life of the people who live in those cities. So it's about the composition of your migration program and how that's structured and ensuring that you're taking the opportunities where there needs to be more population growth and easing the pressures in the places where the population growth is causing negative impacts. So that's what a good population growth strategy does. That's why Alan Tudge, together with myself and David Coleman, have been working together to deliver a population growth management strategy that brings all these things together. See, managing population growth is not just about the migration intake. It's about the destination migration agreements. It's about infrastructure and congestion-busting. It's about city deals that provide for the quality of life of people who live in our urban centres all around the country. It's about all of these things. That's how you manage the impact of population growth, both in terms of the benefits it brings and the strains it puts on infrastructure and that's what our government is delivering.

JOURNALIST: Given the sensitivity of immigration, I guess, across the Tasman at the moment, is now the right time to be talking about limiting population... immigration, I should say?

PRIME MINISTER: It's always the right time to be addressing the issues and needs that the Australian public are concerned about and want addressed. As I said yesterday, this debate about population growth and migration has nothing to do with those other issues that have been the subject of recent focus. We must separate these things. Managing population growth is a practical challenge for governments, that's what it is. It shouldn't be hijacked by other debates about race or about tolerance or these other issues. We've seen what happens when these important practical debates are hijacked by these other extremist views, which occur from both the right and from the left. I'm determined to not see the serious population growth management issues taken off course, to be hijacked by those who want to push other agendas. I have no purchase in those agendas, I have no truck with those agendas and I denounce them absolutely.

What I'm focused on, what the Premier is focused on and I'm sure what the Lord Mayor is focused on, is ensuring we have liveable cities and that we have good population growth management strategies. That means you have to balance all of these various components, whether it's migration intakes, migration composition, how it is spread across states and territories, the infrastructure you invest in, the city and regional deals you're able to strike.

These are the things that I think focus on the needs of Australians and I think it's important that we address them and we reject absolutely any effort to try and recast those important practical issues for Australians, in the context of other matters, which only seek to divide.

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible] 160,000 will be that new migration level?

PRIME MINISTER: When I'm in a position to announce what our migration cap will be, I'll do it.

JOURNALIST: What about social media, exactly how can you regulate it?

PRIME MINISTER: I've written to Prime Minister Abe, who is the President of G20 this year. There will be a leaders' summit in Osaka later this year and what I've asked the Prime Minister to do - and I've been in touch through diplomatic relations through a number of other G20 countries, is to get this on the agenda for leaders. Australia can take action in this area and we're looking at some practical proposals in this area right now. But for those actions to have greater impact on social media companies and the technology companies, it has to be done in concert with other big economies around the world.

These social media companies have built this technology, they've created these capabilities. In the overwhelming majority of cases, they're available for peaceful and happy purposes, but we do know that they can be used and weaponised by terrorists of any description.

If you can write an algorithm to make sure that the ads they want you to see can appear on your mobile phone, then I'm quite confident they can write an algorithm to screen out hate content on social media platforms. So we have to work with them. The G20 has worked together to make sure these big companies pay their taxes, I'm sure we can work together to make sure they protect our citizens, by ensuring that their tools that they have developed are not used by terrorists as weapons to advance their agendas of hate.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there's been a report and I assume it to be correct, of a New Zealand-style copycat massacre emanating on social media in Geelong. Are you aware of it and what sort of view would you take, whether it's a prank or hopefully…

PRIME MINISTER: I haven't seen reports of that, so I'm not in a position to comment.

JOURNALIST: That person called himself…

PRIME MINISTER: Again, I haven't seen reports of it so I'm not going to make any comments on something I've not been briefed on and has not been reported to me.

JOURNALIST: Are you worried about copycats, though?

PRIME MINISTER: What I said on the weekend and what I said on Friday is that the Australian Government has stood up all its capabilities around the country, including in partnerships with state and territory governments, whether it’s here in South Australia, New South Wales or Victoria and other places, to ensure Australians are kept safe. One of the initiatives I announced yesterday was our $55 million grants program to ensure that places of worship, places of religious assembly, religious schools, can have in place the security that they need to keep the members of their faith communities safe.

So the government is working with states and territories all around the country and in our own right, to keep Australians safe. We're very aware of what the risks are. We're very aware of what the threats are. These are not new threats. They've been around a long time and our agencies and the work that they have done have put us in a very strong position to be able to take the best action we can. There are no guarantees in this area, but I can assure you that it has the full and complete attention of all governments, not just the Commonwealth Government.

JOURNALIST: What is your general view on Australians who commit crimes overseas? Should they be allowed to serve their jail time in Australia?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, it all depends on the relationship between the two countries and the legal issues. Now, in the case of the terrorist in New Zealand, he will be prosecuted under New Zealand law and he will serve his sentence in New Zealand. That is what we understand to be the case and the New Zealand authorities are leading that prosecution and we are assisting both with that investigation. So that is how that issue will be addressed.

JOURNALIST: Will you also preference One Nation last, as Labor has said it will do?

PRIME MINISTER: There will be no preference deals with One Nation.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you disappointed that your Party’s Women’s Council hasn’t come out and publically backed the female candidate in this weekend’s Sturt preselection battle?

PRIME MINISTER: What I know is that since I became Prime Minister, half the candidates that have been selected across the country in my political movement, have been women. Half the Senate tickets that are being led by our movement, the Liberal Party in partnership, the Coalition, are led by women and Anne Ruston is here, leading our charge here in South Australia. There are now seven women who serve in my Cabinet, which is the largest number of women ever to serve in a Cabinet and Karen Andrews is here with me today. That's how I've started as a leader and that's how I intend to continue.

JOURNALIST: But can we speak specifically about Sturt?

PRIME MINISTER: I think I've covered that. The pre-selectors will make their own decision on the weekend and that's how it should be in any political movement.

JOURNALIST: But is it not your Party's Women's Council role to speak up for women?

PRIME MINISTER: That's an organisational matter, I'm happy to leave it to them.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, will meeting your emissions target have an impact on the economy, jobs and wages?

PRIME MINISTER: I set out several weeks ago how our Government is going to meet its 2030 emissions reduction target of 26 per cent. I took the country through, tonne by tonne, how we're going to meet that target, from our Climate Solutions Fund, our investments in Snowy Hydro 2.0, our energy efficiency measures, our investment in the interconnector between Tasmania and Victoria which will enable more clean hydro power to make its way onto the mainland and indeed potentially through the grid and the system, even to South Australia. I've set that out. I made it very clear that under our Government, we turned around by 1.1 billion tonnes, 1.1 billion tonnes of carbon abatement deficit that we had under Labor. We've turned that around and we will now overachieve on our Kyoto targets by about 369 million tonnes.

So we've overachieved in meeting our emissions reduction targets and I've said we are going to carry over that success in meeting our 2030 targets. I've said that we will not be using taxpayers' money to buy foreign carbon credits from the carbon traders wherever they are around the world. That's not how we're meeting our emissions reductions target. We're doing it by taking action on emissions reductions right here in Australia.

Now, Bill Shorten today cannot tell you - in fact he refuses to tell you - will he use the carry over credits? Will he buy, using taxpayers' money, foreign carbon credits to meet his 45 per cent emissions reduction target? Now, I can tell you telling on the BAE economics work that has been released today, that on his target, already, if he were to carry over the credits under his current target of 45 per cent, that would lift wholesale electricity prices in this country by around 56 per cent. If he doesn't carry over the carbon credits, that figure is north of 90 per cent. So it’s very important. I’ve levelled with the Australian people about what our commitment is and about how we're going to meet it.

Bill Shorten refuses to tell Australians what the cost of his reckless emissions targets will be on the agricultural sector, on power prices, on jobs, on wages. That same economics report shows that even in the best-case scenario under Labor's plan, it will cost wages $9,000 a year. So Bill Shorten needs to come clean on what the cost of his reckless emissions reduction targets are. We have sensible targets. We have plans to meet those targets, that don't cost our economy, that enable our economy to continue to grow and for jobs to be created. Bill Shorten has a plan to put up the cost of living on the basis of a reckless emissions target that he can't even tell you how he'll meet.

But it's been great to be here with the Premier and Lord Mayor and my colleagues today. It is a very exciting day for the city of Adelaide. It's another chapter in our book that we're writing as to how we're managing population growth in this country. It's a key part of our set of policies to address that very important issue and right here in Adelaide, it's about supporting the growth and building for that growth and building the jobs of the future, so those who come to this great city will be able to have the economic opportunities they seek.

Thank you all very much.             AUSTRALIA-ISRAEL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE Q&A

QUESTION: I suppose one question I'll ask is about the role of social media, YouTube, Facebook. And the sort of thought process that we’re having as a nation of how we can create that sort of society, taking into account the disruption of technology.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you Leon. I think that’s an important question we will now work through. First of all I'd like to make it clear that the social media technology companies did cooperate with the requests from agencies and authorities in Australia. But clearly the capability to deliver on that willingness hasn’t been present. And that's the problem. There needs to be the capability to shut this… these horrific things down immediately. And if you can't do that then the responsibility of having those features available is something that really genuinely needs to be questioned. It's not something you just rush into with a knee jerk reaction. It’s something that is going to be considered very carefully by the Government about what our response can be specifically to this and we will do that in a measured way, we’ll do that in a very determined and informed way. But all companies, as you leave the market standing, carry social responsibilities. And I should say it’s not just limited to social media companies. A number of times we have had to also address the concerns that come out of the gaming, the online gaming sector as well. We can’t ignore the possible impacts of links also on how they can be affected and twisted, what those who engage in that sort of violence. So that is not an accusation, it’s just a simple observation that there are many things we need to address here in social media and other areas online, particularly to keep Australians safe, that’s certain.

QUESTION: Thank you very much, we’ve got microphones to my left and my right. One of the questions is we talk about civil liberties as being essential for our society. We talk about security. Are there red lines or how do we manage this as a society?

PRIME MINISTER: Well thanks Leon. [Inaudible] Liberties are [inaudible], that’s what societies do. It’s not a jungle. That's not a civilized place to be a successful civilization. That always requires a balance between personal responsibility for one's own actions, in particular being responsible for its impact on others. And what then is the responsibility of the state in [inaudible] that behaviour. And I think this is always a moving balance in response to issues that arise, technology that occurs. Various influences that present themselves and sometimes these things can be required for periods. And on other occasions on a permanent basis. And so I think it's very important to make… we’re all flexible. We know what the principles are. Australia believes in free speech, of course we do. But again, let’s not allow that debate to be hijacked by the tribalists and extremists either and turned it into the sort of black and white type of debate that occurs in this area. It’s just not as simple as that. I faced this, and anyone who is involved in politics does. You are expected to and I understand why we try and simplify issues. But the truth is, getting the balance right between civil responsibility and civil law making is very difficult. It’s extremely complex, it’s not straightforward. There are many shades of grey and I think it’s important to be responsible and understand that and don’t try for oversimplification on some issues when it simply doesn’t exist.

QUESTION: Thank you for that informative, interesting and courageous speech where you have shared everything you have about diversity and inclusiveness and how important it is for us to support each other and society to welcome immigrants and help each other. My question is about the success of our gun laws in Australia. Do you think that New Zealand should follow our lead and adopt Australia [inaudible] John Howard?

PRIME MINISTER: Unquestionably. I think this is what the Prime Minister has indicated. We have already been discussions about that, with the Prime Minister and I about how Australia can offer any assistance that is necessary to go down that path. And what John Howard did after Port Arthur, who amongst us would ever have thought we see something like again in our lifetime in our part of the world? And on this occasion the number was even higher. So I believe [inaudible] and we will see the support. I think it’s important to understand the difference between the gun law arrangements in New Zealand and Australia. It is very significant thanks to the bravery and the courage of John Howard and should never be allowed to be undermined or watered down with any deals that are done at a state level, or anywhere else for that matter. These… that was a unique moment in time where John Howard proved his leadership in response to this most horrific tragedy that happened on Australian soil. And we must preserve it and never forget it. Never forgetting is so important, to think oh it’s been many years now. No, no. As we’ve just learned, the danger lurks.

QUESTION: Thank you, Angus Livingstone from the Australia Associated Press. Our security agencies have been very effective in thwarting Islamic State inspired terror plots here in Australia. What assurances have you sought from them that they are on top of the threat from far right extremist plots here in Australia and do you believe that we’re doing enough to counter that threat?

PRIME MINISTER: In the area of counter-terrorism we are always seeking to do more. This is not a new area of activity for our security agencies, they have been monitoring this area for quite a long time. Sadly, white supremacy in sections of Australia is not new. It’s been around for well over a century and at one time in Australia’s history it could even be argued that it held some sort of mainstream position. Thankfully that’s no longer the case. I know there has been a number of comments made about how a terrorist was able to go for so long and be undetected. And I made reference to the fact that he had only been in Australia for 45 days out of the last three years. But I would encourage people who may think that this is an easy thing to identify, just go on social media. Read some of the comments that have been made in relation to the stands that I or others have taken in denouncing these attacks. And see some of the comments that are on there. There are hundreds of them, if not thousands. This what I found truly disturbing, in addition to the sheer atrocity. This is why I have given the speech I have given today. I have to call this out to my fellow Australians. We need to fix this, we really do. How we deal with each other, how we understand and manage differences between us. Because if we don’t, it goes to a very, very dark place and I do not want to see that happen in this country. A country in which my children are growing up, and yours are as well. So the short answer is yes, it’s a serious issue. It will always get more and more attention. It has not not been on the radar, it has very much been on the radar, certainly with ASIO and our intelligence agencies and to the extent by which this is done by state and territory police forces. I know there has been some commentary on that today, well that is something that I am sure will be pursued by the Home Affairs Minister with those state and territory jurisdictions to ensure that is all joined up. But as we assess the lessons of this, I think it is important - that’s why I’m quite open with answering the question - I don’t answer the question from a position of defensiveness. I think in all these situations, you look at what you’ve done well and what we have done in that area over a number of years will put us in a much stronger position over the last couple of days to stand up and deal with any potential further threat that might come in those areas. So we are forever vigilant, I can never take anything for granted, and so Australians right across the country, our agencies are working closely together both to counter that threat and any other threats.  

QUESTION: Thank you so much. The question that I would mention now is that you called these ‘troubled times’. My question is going to be what can you do as Prime Minister to get together people of different faiths and communities, and I think you’ve answered that question by the address you’ve given and [inaudible]. It’s very hard for us to ask questions because I think we’re all grappling with what we heard about in other countries but not so close to Australia and New Zealand. I could think of no person better that you in a time of [inaudible] so would like to propose a vote of thanks on behalf of us all here today. Ladies and gentlemen, PM Scott Morrison.DOORSTOP, SYDNEY

PRIME MINISTER: Love conquers hate. That is what we came here today to proclaim. Love conquers hate and an attack on one faith is an attack on all faiths. No one understands that frankly, better than the Coptic community and the many other religious communities around the world, whether here in Australia, in New Zealand, or any part of the globe today. But they all bound together in a community, faith, and I think there is a community today that extends beyond any one faith. It is a community that is committed to innocence. It's a community that is committed to love and peace and that is the group that binds together today, to speak against the evil and the atrocity that was committed against Muslim brothers and sisters in Christchurch.

So today we are gathering together in churches all around the nation, as they gathered together in temples yesterday and mosques on Friday, to all come today, to bring Australians together in one community and to proclaim the triumph of love over hate.

So I'm very pleased to be here with David Coleman today and to join with the Coptic community and to have Jenny and the girls here. This is the important message of hope today. In the midst of this awful atrocity, this is the hope that we can all cling to as peace-loving and free people all around the world.

JOURNALIST:  Just on Fraser Anning’s remarks, do you think the bipartisan censure motion goes far enough? Or do you think there is a case to remove him from the Senate?

PRIME MINISTER: I think the full force of the law should be applied to Senator Anning.

JOURNALIST: We have seen horrific pictures on social media, the attack was live-streamed.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah.

JOURNALIST:  At what point are social media companies accountable?

PRIME MINISTER: First of all I’d say that the social media companies cooperated with authorities over the last 48 hours, so I'm making no comment against their willingness to cooperate. But I sadly have to say that the capacity to actually assist fully is very limited on the technology side. In the past, they have suspended this sort of Facebook live-streaming and assurances were given that when it was put back up, it could avoid this. Clearly it hasn't. So I think there is some very real discussions that have to be had about how these facilities and capabilities as they exist on social media, can continue to be offered, where there can't be the assurances given at a technology level, that once these images get out there, it is very difficult to prevent them.

Now, there's obviously a personal responsibility for those who would seek to share these images. Personally I have not even seen them, I don't wish to see them. I don't wish to give the extremist terrorist, the right-wing extremist terrorist, the satisfaction that I would have looked at that, because I have no interest in what he has to say. I have no interest in his manifesto. His manifesto is a weak manifesto of hate that has no place in our country or in any other country of the world today.

But we will be seeking to get assurances from the social media companies about their capability to ensure that this tool cannot be used by terrorists.

JOURNALIST: Can you give us an update on cooperation between New Zealand and the Australian authorities [inaudible] prosecuted?

PRIME MINISTER: The process is for him to be prosecuted in New Zealand and New Zealand authorities are providing the updates on those matters. I'm having regular meetings and updates from my agencies and authorities about not only what's happening here in Australia and the actions and precautions that are being taken here, but also the significant assistance that is being provided by Australia to New Zealand. I had a very lovely message from Prime Minister Ardern this morning when I awoke, thanking Australia for everything that is being done to assist them.

An event of this horrific nature would test any nation's capability in responding. I want to commend all those in New Zealand, the health workers, those in the hospitals, the emergency service workers, the police and other whose have attended the scene for the way that they have been able to perform their responsibilities in what I can only imagine must be the most difficult of circumstances emotionally and otherwise. But they have applied their professionalism. Australians are there providing assistance, coordination assistance, medical assistance. There are already Australians in New Zealand supporting coronial efforts. I know having met with the Muslim community here yesterday, that community is also providing support to the Muslim community in New Zealand as well. So, every request is being not only met but anticipated. They ‘have us at hello,’ when it comes to supporting them.

JOURNALIST: In Australia, is security being tightened, are you concerned about copycats here?

PRIME MINISTER: The short answer to “are we taking precautions?” Yes. I said that two days ago, that has been the immediate response; to stand up our response here in Australia right across the country, not just at places of worship, but more generally. That is being implemented through the state and territory police forces and I want the commend them for all the work they are doing. Their level of cooperation with federal agencies is exemplary, as you'd expect it to be. I want to thank all Premiers, particularly here in New South Wales given the nature of the investigation that has been undertaken in relation to this Tarrant. The work that has been done, not only on that investigation here in New South Wales, but how that extends to a broader international investigation that is being coordinated and assisted by Australian authorities.

So yes, we have stood up our response plan. It is in place and that's the vigilance that has been applied each and every day, to keep Australians safe. But as I said this morning, it's also about keeping Australians together. We can all band together to stand against this hatred and this violence. We all stand together - people of many different faiths, or no faith at all - standing together for innocence and peace and for love over hate.

Thank you, all, very much.REMARKS, COPTIC DIOCESE OF SYDNEY MASS

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you to this wonderful community, which has welcomed Jenny and my two girls our two girls, Abbey and Lily to be here today. A little bit different to the church that we’re used to, just as much noise though -

[Laughter]

At Pentecostal church as there is here in the Coptic Orthodox Church, full of celebration, full of worship, full of family and full of praise. It's truly wonderful to be here with my good friend Bishop Daniel and to also meet the other Bishop Daniel. I don’t know what the collective noun is for a group of Bishop Daniels.

[Laughter]

But whatever it is, it’s great to be here with both of you. I have appreciated the prayers and support of the Coptic community throughout my entire public life and that continues to this day. I’m very grateful for it because those prayers I know, are not just offered up for myself, but for my family as well and for our community. As I know you do also for David Coleman as well and his family, Craig and his family, Tom – who I welcome also, from Sutherland Council – and all of those who are gathered here today.

The purpose of the original invitation was extended to be here today to acknowledge and celebrate 50 years of the Coptic Church here in Australia, when Father Mina came here on Australia Day 50 years ago. I think there's something beautiful about that; greeted a handful of Coptics at the time, full of excitement about what the future would bring for them. And they met - because there was no beautiful Coptic Church like this at that time – so they met in a Salvation Army Hall. And I thought, there is something beautiful about that as well. Because just like where we are today, which was originally built as an Anglican Church and today the iconography and all of the presentation of a beautiful Coptic Church, I think it says a lot about the nature of our multicultural Australia. That whatever foundations we build upon, we built it up to what it is today; which is a tolerant, multicultural, diverse, strong society. Not a godless society, but a society of so many millions of Australians who share a faith and hold a faith.

Faith is a mystery. It’s a mystery to those who hold it and to those who don’t. What do I mean by that? Some think faith and those who hold a faith are about having some set of rules or moral superiority, or they think they’re purer than other people and things like that. But all of us know, those who have a faith, that it's quite the opposite.

A faith is something that you hold to because you understand - I believe - and you acknowledge the humility of the human condition. You understand the fragility of humanity. You understand its weaknesses. You appreciate its beauty, its strengths. But we also understand its susceptibilities and we all have those. Now I have no doubt that who have no such faith can also appreciate these things as well, it's not exclusive. But it is the thing I think, that draws those of faith, to faith. It is a fundamental understanding of our humanity and its fragility. So that draws us as individuals, seeking to understand our own existence, into our relationship in the Christian faith with our God I believe it the same motivation that draws so many others to their faiths.

But the other thing about faith is, it's just not individual understanding of humanity and fragility and weakness, but it is also about community. In Hebrews it says – and the scholars will differ I’m sure, on who the writer of Hebrews was - but I believe this is Paul and so does Bishop Daniel by the way.

[Laughter]

He said; “Forsake not,” in Hebrews, “your meeting together.” And Jesus said; “Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there with you.”

Faith is also about community and here we are in a community. Because from that community we know we draw strength. This is the wonderful community, it is a strong community, it is a vibrant community. But there’s no community that does not know hardship. There is not a community that does not understand grief. As Bishop Daniels said, it is not uncommon in Egypt for Copts to know the full horror of hate and violence.

It is sad when we hear from Bishop Daniel, that you get used to it. It’s something we could never really get used to, and we hope never to do. But I think that is an honest expression of what is faced by people of religious faith and in particularly the Copts in Egypt. But as we know, I think as we stand here today and we reflect on and remember and pray for and identify with those of another faiths today, those of the Islamic faith, the Cops better than anyone understand I believe, the pain and hurt and the grief that our Muslim brothers and sisters are going through in New Zealand right now and across this nation.

Yesterday I met with the National Imams Council and all I could say to them was to express my profound grief to them, as you have done this morning. As Australians right across this country will be doing; in churches yesterday, in temples, on Friday in prayers in mosques, all understanding our human fragility and how in a moment, innocence can be attacked and lost, by an act of hate.

But you know, when you go back to why Father Mina came here 50 years ago, he came here to preach and to gather together a community of hope. A hope established on this very important point, which is a message to all of those who would choose hate and a life of hate; a life of hate only ends in ruin and suffering. He came here to celebrate, as you and I and all Australians do in the faiths that we pursue, a message of love.

It says; “Do not be troubled by the world, because I have overcome them,” you know that scripture. What is meant by that is that Jesus overcame the hate, with love. That is the message of Abrahamic faiths and I believe many others; a message of love for others.

Now I can assure you and those who would seek to peddle hate and culture hate and ferment hate, in whatever place they are and from whatever motive it comes, that hate will never defeat love, because love is the basis of peace.

[Applause]

That is the victory we declare today over these horrendous and despicable events, in of all places, a place called ‘Christ church’, a place called Christchurch. We stand together, I believe as a world today, in speaking out against that.

So my prayer this morning – I’ll pray again I understand, in a moment – but the one I particularly want to share with you here is the prayers of St. Francis and I’m sure many of you will know it. It is a prayer for a troubled time, which this is.

It says: “Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there is sadness, joy. Oh divine master, grant that I might not so much seek to be consoled, as to console; to be understood, as to understand; to be loved, as to love. For it is in giving that we receive, and it is in the pardoning that we are pardoned. It is in dying, that we are born to eternal life.”

That was the prayer of St Francis. I can't think of any better commendation to all of us as to how to respond and I want to thank the Coptic community for the way you have reached out to our Muslim community. That's what about country is all about - the respect for each other, the care and love for each other  and as I said, this community knows better than most, as well as any other the hurt that they would be feeling now and out of that, we profess love.

So I thank you very much. Peace be with you.

[Applause]



DOORSTOP, LAKEMBA

Christchurch terrorist attack; Senator Anning
PRESIDENT OF THE LEBANESE MUSLIM ASSOCIATION, SAMIER DANDAN: Welcome all. This is an initiative that our Prime Minister has decided to take, to come to the Islamic organisation and meet the Islamic religious leaders and Islamic community organisations, to offer his condolences to the sad events the whole world witnessed yesterday, an event that the community will pay the price and I guess humanity will pay the price. We are here to show solidarity that collectively together, we aim to stand up any time to Islamophobia or discrimination or extremism that affect the social fabric of what we hold dear to our hearts – that is our nation of Australia. Prime Minister?

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you very much. Thank you Samier, to the Grand Mufti and to the members of the National Imams Council, it’s a great privilege to be here with you today and to be joined by the Foreign Minister and David Coleman the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural affairs. I want to thank you all for bringing everyone together to have the opportunity today, not only for me to come with my colleagues and express our profound and deepest condolences and sympathies for the horrific and tragic terrorist attack that took place in New Zealand - that not only impacted New Zealand but frankly has impacted all around the world and certainly has shuddered our own nation and all of our communities here. It’s important to be here standing with you, because as Prime Minister Ardern said yesterday, an attack against one, is an attack against all of us, from all communities who love peace, who love the freedoms that we have both here in Australia and New Zealand and the peace-loving peoples of the world. This is what is under attack.

We have spoken today about the real enemy being hatred and intolerance. This is the root of all extremism and terrorism. It's about fostering a hate and trying to foster a cycle of hate and we stand here together today to break that cycle as we always seek to do, to actually bring Australians together.

This horrific event took place and was targeted to one particular community, the Islamic community, in a mosque as they went to prayers in New Zealand. But in doing so, it was an attack on all peace-loving peoples, on all innocent peoples and that's why we can all stand together in support of our Muslim brothers and sisters who were the specific targets of this attack and to ensure that we speak out against it happening anywhere else and to any other Australian here or any other peace-loving person in the world today.

So I want to thank you very much for the opportunity to come and share the feedback and understand the feelings within the community today. I want to thank you for the response that you've made in bringing your own community together, providing support. I particularly want to thank the community here for the way they've actually reached out to the New Zealand Muslim community and I have had engagements today with the New Zealand Government and the New Zealand Prime Minister about how the Muslim communities between the two countries are supporting each other to go through this very difficult time for them. The Muslim community in Australia is very well-established, very well organised, it has great support and social structures that reach out to its own community here, for which it should be commended, which as a Government and as a Minister I have a close knowledge and had a deep involvement with. That same experience is being offered in support of their brothers and sisters across the Tasman Sea in New Zealand.

I also wanted to say - and I would normally not want to give this any oxygen - but I want to absolutely and completely denounce the statements made by Senator Anning in all of the comments that he has made. His conflation of this horrendous terrorist attack with issues of immigration, in his attack on Islamic faith specifically, these comments are appalling and they're ugly and they have no place in Australia, in the Australian Parliament also. He should be, frankly, ashamed of himself. It's not something my Government associates with. It's not something the good faith people of Australia, of any faith or any background, would seek to associate with. So, I think I have made that pretty clear out where I stand on that.

I know that there have been discussions between Senator Cormann and Senator Wong today and the Government will lead, as part of a bipartisan motion, a motion of censure against Senator Anning when Parliament returns in a couple of weeks’ time. The Parliament I'm sure will express a very clear view about what he has had to say.

With that said, I'm happy to take questions. I’m not going to trouble our partners and colleagues to be here for the usual political questions that are sometimes asked, I want to thank them very much for hosting me today and pulling people together at such short notice and for the leadership that has been shown. We are standing together against hatred and against intolerance and extremism in all of its forms. I want to thank the community here for their ongoing support in all of these tasks, thank you.

The Ministers and I are happy to take questions.

JOURNALIST: Is there any medical assistance to New Zealand?

PRIME MINISTER: We're responding to a series of requests. On that front there have not been significant requests made at this time. We're providing significant assistance when it comes to the police investigation, the technical aspects of that investigation. The international engagement element because this reaches well beyond the borders of both New Zealand and Australia and we're providing that support.

But I can tell you also, as I conveyed the offer of support today, the Muslim community here in Australia is offering support with counselling services and even the most practical issues around the burial of those who are deceased and I want to thank them for that.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister do you think our gun laws must be reviewed and or tightened?

PRIME MINISTER: Our gun laws are always being reviewed, as you know our gun laws were significantly changed after the Port Arthur massacre. I had hoped and prayed we would never see a massacre in our part of the world, of that scale and order again. But sadly, we have and I think we must be clear that the context of the gun laws between New Zealand and Australia are very different. They're very different as a result of the massacre that occurred in Australia all those years ago. But I tell you, the events of the last 24 hours … it was over 20 years ago but it all comes back and we all know as Australians, how we just grieved so deeply during the Port Arthur massacre. So I can only imagine now how New Zealanders are feeling. I say to them again, kia kaha, stay strong.

JOURNALIST: So you will be reviewing the gun laws?

PRIME MINISTER: We're always doing that. We're always seeking to improve them. As you know, they're matters for states and territories, but I can say that Australia has, I would argue the most strengthened gun laws of anywhere in the world today. We are the standard by which other countries measure the strength of their gun laws. To John Howard, we will always be grateful for that.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when was the latest conversation you have had about the terror threat level?

PRIME MINISTER: This morning.

JOURNALIST: What was discussed?

PRIME MINISTER: No change.

JOURNALIST: Is there an ongoing threat of terrorism in Australia?

PRIME MINISTER: Look, there always has been. This is not new - as we discussed today in our meeting, these right-wing extremist views, these white supremacist, white separatist views, are not new. I mean, these sentiments have sadly existed in Australia for hundreds of years. So - hatred, bigotry, racism, these are things that we do stand against and we always seek to combat. We are a tolerant, multicultural society, the most successful immigrant country on the planet. We can, I think, take comfort in that fact today.

But that said, we will always seek to improve wherever we can. So these issues aren't new, these have always constituted a threat. There has always been and we have certainly invested in and ensured there's a capability to address that element of the terrorist threat in Australia. It hasn't had a lot of public commentary, either in the media or elsewhere but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. It has been and it has been very important to us particularly in the last 24 hours, that we've been able to draw on the knowledge and the work done by our agencies in this area, that we can lend our expertise and advice about these matters as part of the investigation.

JOURNALIST: Have you spoken to the Indonesian Prime Minister in relation to the attacks?

PRIME MINISTER: I have been in contact with the President of Indonesia and the Prime Minister of Malaysia.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister have you have any conversation with Fraser Anning and have you told him perhaps, to pull his finger out? Given he only had 19 votes, I mean, how can he be a representative and be allowed to keep on going like this?

PRIME MINISTER: As I said, the Senate will deal with that when they resume. That will be a bipartisan motion moved by the Government. I don't think Fraser Anning is in any doubt about what my views are of his despicable comments.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister what did you say to President Widodo when you spoke to him?

PRIME MINISTER: Well the way we usually contact each other - he's in the middle of an election campaign over there – is we have a very good process of texting, as we’ve done many, many times together since we formed our relationship last year. It was effectively to express the same sentiments that I have here today. In particular in relation to Indonesians who have been caught up specifically in this terrorist attack and to offer our sympathies and condolences there. But also to make it very clear to all Indonesians that this attack on people of Islamic faith that has occurred at their most private and peaceful time of worship, is abhorrent to Australians and it is abhorrent to my Government and to ensure that is well understood throughout the region.

JOURNALIST: Are you concerned that this suspect wasn't on an Australian intelligence watch list?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, the interesting thing about this individual is he was - as I'm advised - on nobody's radar anywhere, even when it comes, I'm advised, in relation to any offences that may have occurred. So, this is the real challenge when it comes to issues of terrorism, regardless of its origins; in this case extremist views based on white supremacist and separatist ideologies which are abhorrent and foster hate. This is what happens, so you know, that's why we need to continue to be vigilant in this area. But there are no guarantees and protections. Hatred and intolerance will seek to work its evil wherever it can.

JOURNALIST: The Australian National Imams Council this morning said that Senator Anning is inciting violence and hatred. Is there nothing more that you can do other than a censure motion when Senate resumes?

PRIME MINISTER: To the extent - if Senator Anning has committed offence under any law anywhere in this country, I would be expecting authorities to take whatever action they could in relation to that.

JOURNALIST: Will you be extraditing the perpetrator of these crimes back to Australia?

PRIME MINISTER: That’s very premature. There is a court process going on in New Zealand, as I said yesterday and it's very important that New Zealand - this has occurred on their sovereign territory - it has involved an Australian-born citizen and he is facing the New Zealand justice system. That's where that process begins.

JOURNALIST: What else can you tell us about your conversation with Jacinda Ardern?

PRIME MINISTER: Other than her appreciation for the great warmth and support that New Zealanders have felt from Australians - we're cousins, New Zealanders and Australians and they've really felt the outreach from Australia. The gesture yesterday of lowering the flag over Parliament House to half-mast, I sent Jacinda Ardern a picture of it and said: "We're with you.” She was greatly appreciative of that, as flags around the country today are at half-mast in solidarity and in sympathy and in condolence for the people of New Zealand. I understand - I was speaking to the Governor-General earlier today – and there's a New Zealand flag flying at half-mast at his residence as well. So they're very appreciative of the support.

This is a traumatic and tectonic event for New Zealand. This is, I think, what is so shocking; it's such a peaceful place. It's such a calm, peaceful place. I lived there for some years myself and for this to happen in that silence and peacefulness, is incredibly distressing. But its intent was to inspire more hatred and violence. Its intent was to try and provoke others to the same. Its intent was to provide some sort of sick leadership to others who share those views. What we say today is; “No.” No, peace and love will triumph.

Thank you very much.DOORSTOP - KIRRIBILLI HOUSE

PRIME MINISTER: Australia and New Zealand are not just allies, we’re not just partners, we are family. As family members with our New Zealand cousins, today we grieve, we are shocked, we are appalled, we are outraged and we stand here and condemn absolutely the attack that occurred today by an extremist, right-wing, violent terrorist that has taken the lives, stolen the lives, in a vicious, murderous attack, that has claimed so many New Zealanders.

This attack reminds us of the evil that is ever-present and would seek to strike out at any time. I particularly want to convey my heartfelt sympathies not only to all New Zealand people, as I'm sure all Australians would join me in doing, but I particularly want to express my sincere prayers and thoughts for those New Zealanders and indeed Australians of Islamic faith today, who have been the subject of this vicious and callous right-wing extremist attack.

I’m not going to go through the details of this today, because that is properly done by the New Zealand authorities. The New Zealand authorities are conducting that investigation and I have just concluded a briefing with our own authorities and agencies here. It is for New Zealand, who are obviously leading the investigation, to be able to confirm details of any individuals and certainly the number of casualties. I will leave it to them to make those announcements.

I have already been in contact with Prime Minister Ardern. She is obviously caught up in many briefings today. She described it as their darkest day and I agree with her, I agree with her absolutely. Australian authorities have already put in place all the necessary responses and precautions that are necessary here in Australia. Our agencies are working closely with New Zealand authorities and have prepared other capacities to be stood up to support New Zealand as and when requested.

I can confirm that the individual who was taken into custody, I have been advised, is an Australian-born citizen and obviously that element of the investigation Australian authorities are involved in. They will be proceeding with their investigation, which has already been stood up, involving all the relevant agencies.

We will keep Australians safe in every way possible we can. We will work with our partners in the region, our family in the region in New Zealand, to do everything we can to support them to keep their people safe as well. But right now there is a numbness. There is just a still shock that has laid upon us all, as we thought would be unthinkable in a place like Christchurch. But it has happened and it is such a sad and devastating reminder of the evil that can be ever-present around us.

Happy to take a couple of questions, but as I said, in terms of the details of the investigations they are properly addressed by the New Zealand authorities. We are obviously being kept abreast of developments in those investigations and our participation in supporting those investigations, that information is needed to help us to our part of the task. But I want to assure all Australians that the immediate responses that are required to ensure the security and safety of Australians, have already been actioned. Our authorities are working together - ASIO, the AFP, State police - to ensure that those arrangements are in place. I have also contacted the Leader of the Opposition, or contacted me actually, we almost contacted each other at the same time. He has been offered a full briefing on these matters and I’m sure as we just discussed, he would join me in the sentiments I have expressed.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister was the Australian man already known to authorities?

PRIME MINISTER: The information I have available to me at the moment is that he was not.

JOURNALIST: Does it concern you that a man who was not known to authorities is capable of something like this?

PRIME MINISTER: It concerns me that this horrific and appalling attack was capable of any human being. But sadly it is and in the quietest of places. That’s why we take the steps we do. That’s why we put in place the capacities that we have to seek to try to keep Australian safe and work with our partners and allies and family across the ditch and within the region to keep their citizens safe as well. It is a truly saddening day.

JOURNALIST: What else do we know, what else do we know about the man, what else can you divulge?

PRIME MINISTER: At this stage I’m not in a position to be able to communicate anything further about this individual, other than to say that he is an Australian-born citizen. That obviously leads to an Australian -based investigation and all of our inquiries here will be absolutely shared and communicated with New Zealand authorities.

JOURNALIST: Do you know if any Australians have been shot?

PRIME MINISTER: I have no information at the moment to suggest any Australians have been killed in this terrible attack, this terrorist attack. But it’s very early on and as is often the case with these terrible events, the first reports can often be misleading. As the night proceeds I will be receiving further updates from the AFP and ASIO and others, as to how matters are progressing. So I would just say to Australians and our New Zealand cousins, hug each other tonight. Hug each other tonight.

JOURNALIST: Is there an elevated level of risk to Australian Muslims? 

PRIME MINISTER: That decision has not been taken and Australia's settings have not been altered. But I can confirm that Australian authorities and police have been working closely together at a State level and at the Commonwealth level to ensure that an inappropriate response and upgrade to ensure Australians’ safety has already been actioned.

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible] greater vigilance at mosques, would that be sound advice or not?

PRIME MINISTER: I think that is a responsible action. I do know that in New Zealand some very and even more specific warnings have been provided as you would expect, in New Zealand. But here, I think obviously people should act with caution, but the New South Wales police, State police around the country have all been advised and are being updated on these events and they will be taking the necessary precautions in each of those places.

But this should always be the case, Australians should always be alert, they should always be aware. These horrible and sickening events in New Zealand are just a terrible reminder of the need for that and there are people who live in our community who hold some appalling, disgusting and abhorrent views that have nothing to do with our way of life and our values. It’s important that we assist our authorities at all times to ensure that they’re best placed to be able to understand where that threat exists.

Terrorism, as we’ve seen today, can be visited upon anyone, anywhere and it is not unique to one particular world view. In this case, as I said, it was a radical, violent, right wing extremist terrorist who has done this and I am appalled and sickened.LIVE CROSS, SEVEN NEWS

MICHAEL USHER: Prime Minister thank you for your time this evening. It really is a lot to take in, quite overwhelming in fact, You’ve been briefed at the highest levels today. The main suspect is from our country. What is the Australian Federal Police investigating tonight? What might you be able to shed some light on there?

PRIME MINISTER: Well the investigation is spanning both obviously New Zealand and here in Australia. The Joint Counter Terrorism operations which investigate these matters have been stood up here in New South Wales and investigations are being undertaken now in relation to this individual. He’s an Australian-born citizen and he is a right-wing, extremist, violent terrorist. That’s what he is and we’ve got to call this out for what it is.

It has just been the most shocking and shuddering of events and particularly, our hearts go out to all New Zealanders and to all those of Islamic faith here in Australia as well as in New Zealand. We just want to reach out to them today and say; “We will stand with you.”

USHER: Prime Minister it is an uncomfortable, even sickening truth that this shooter is a home-grown terrorist from New South Wales. Can you reassure us on an any of the information that you may have, that he has no further links or supporters here?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I can’t offer too much comment on these things this evening, other than to say that in response to these terrorist incidents there is an automatic process which our authorities and police around the country immediately move into. That has been undertaken and that happened earlier today. All steps are taken to ensure the safety of Australians and there is a high level of cooperation directly between New Zealand and Australian authorities. They are investigating and taking action in relation to this terrorist act.

USHER: Do we need to be concerned about any similar attacks here? Any extra protection for mosques in particular?

PRIME MINISTER: Well these steps are already being taken as you’d expect them to be. The terrorist threat level in Australia remains unchanged on the advice of ASIO to me today. But always, always, I think we need to be mindful of these threats. Terrorism comes in all forms and in this case, it came in the form of right-wing radical extremism.

USHER: It’s good advice of yours, to give everyone a hug on this subject, but what do we say to New Zealand, our closest friends, this will never be forgotten?

PRIME MINISTER: We say kia kaha, which is Maori for “stay strong”. Whanau is the word for family in Maori and that’s how we see New Zealanders and I expressed our sincere condolences to all of them, our sympathies and our prayers and thoughts and I wished Prime Minister Ardern - who I will be speaking with again - every support we can provide to them at this time. Christchurch is such a peaceful place. It has been rocked by tragedy before, but not of this kind. This is a very evil kind and we will be doing everything to support them in very possible way we can.

USHER: Indeed. Alright Prime Minister we really appreciate your time, thank you.DOORSTOP, MELBOURNE MARKETS

PRIME MINISTER: Well good morning everybody, it’s great to be out here in Epping at the Melbourne Markets with Katie Allen, our Liberal candidate for Higgins and Gladys Liu our Liberal candidate for Chisolm. Much of what is bought here it’s finding it’s way back, or out of the Prahran Markets, out into the restaurants of Box Hill Gladys and indeed all around the country. This is a powerhouse of economic activity out here at the markets. I always love coming to the markets whether it’s here or up in Sydney or other places around the country, because as you move from stall to stall, you find small family businesses, intergenerational businesses that are providing jobs, that are supporting themselves, working hard.

This is the fabric of our Australian economy and I’m always so inspired when I talk to people here about the challenges they face and the indomitable spirit they have. This is a lifestyle, this is a way of actually ensuring they’re providing for themselves and their own families and they’re doing it for generations. I mean four generations is the common refrain you’ll hear as you go from stall to stall and producer to producer. So it’s tremendous to be here, backing in small and family businesses.

As you know, particularly up in these markets, they’re businesses that were established by migrants who came to Australia either recently or going back generations and they’ve continued that tradition of hard work. People who came to Australia because they knew it was a place with a fair go for those who have a go. They are very much the values and the belief system of the Liberal Party and what we’re taking forward once again to this next election.

Now, our plan for small and family business is on the record. We’ve cut taxes for small and family businesses. We’ve given increased investment allowances. Increasing the instant asset write-off to $25,000. We’ve cut red tape when it comes to GST compliance from three page forms down to three question forms. We’ve ensured that we’re working to reduce electricity prices by having the policies that hold the big energy companies to account. These are the things that matter to small businesses and cutting red tape for small businesses is incredibly important. Now that’s what we’re doing for small and family businesses and they can expect more of it from my Government.

What the Labor Party have been announcing in recent times will be a curse on small business and family businesses; increasing their costs, increasing their taxes, increasing their red tape. Bill Shorten and Labor’s plan for small and family businesses like the ones you see here, is to basically tell them; “You choose who you’ll have to sack to meet your wages bill,” under a policy that he himself can’t even explain to the Australian people.

As I’ve talked to stall-holders here today, business is okay, but it’s tough. You know what, as our economy moves into more challenging times, now is not the time - it’s never the time, but particularly now - that you would hand the steering wheel of the economy to someone who doesn’t know how to drive one. That’s Bill Shorten.

It is a very dangerous time to be having experiments of high taxes and unexplained polices on wages on the Australian economy, because so many people’s livelihoods and jobs depend on it. These businesses have invested their lifeblood in these businesses and they’ve been doing it for generations. Our policies and our support is backing them in. The Labor Party’s policies will attack the very success of these businesses and that’s why I’m here to stand with those businesses here this morning and stand with them for their futures and defend the things that they need defended, so they can continue to be prosperous.

JOURNALIST: Wouldn’t Labor’s policies though help boost spending, and therefore boost the economy?

PRIME MINISTER: No, because Labor's policies will force businesses like the ones here and all around the country, to sack workers. I don't know how sacking workers and reducing jobs is going to help the Australian economy.

Let me give you an example. With what Labor still can't even explain today, the first people to be hit will be those who want the overtime hours, or the casuals, or the young people who are taking on jobs. They will be the first casualties of Bill Shorten's policies when it comes to the costs he's going to put on small and family businesses. I don't know where he thinks the money is going to rain down from, for them to meet these additional costs. It shows that he has no empathy and no clue about the pressures facing small and family businesses. I understand it, that's why I cut their taxes. When I cut their taxes, the Labor Party opposed me in the Parliament for years. We eventually were able to get it through the Senate and now we have been able to bring forward those tax cuts for small and family businesses down to 25 per cent and we brought that forward by five years.

So, I want small and family businesses to earn more, to keep more of what they earn, so they can pay their staff better and more, because I know that's what small and family businesses do. They will go without taking a return for themselves, to keep their employees in jobs.

What Bill Shorten is doing now is telling them; "You choose who needs to go, to enable you to meet your wages bill."

JOURNALIST: Speaking of wages, in the upcoming federal budget, how big are personal income tax cuts likely to be?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, we've gotten into that pre-Budget speculation time, that's very usual. Having been a Treasurer, I'm used to it and when we're making announcements on things in the Budget, that's when we'll do it. But I can tell you, my Government is always for lower taxes. We've legislated $144 billion worth of tax cuts for all Australians, tax relief for all Australians.

Labor at the next election wants to cut that tax relief in half by $70 billion, denying millions of Australians the tax relief that they deserve and has been legislated.

JOURNALIST: Speaking of wages, there's a suggestion in the paper this morning that restaurant and cafe owners would like to see a freeze on the minimum wage. Is there any justification for that?

PRIME MINISTER: Minimum wages should be set by the independent umpire which is the Fair Work Commission. They have a transparent process for determining that, that process is underway now. That's where these things should be determined in the proper, fair and transparent way. The last time they had a determination, it went up by over 3 per cent, that was their last determination and that's how these decisions should be set.

What concerns me about what Bill Shorten is saying is, he's either lying to Australians - that he can do something about their wages, because he hasn't explained how he's actually going to do it – or if he's telling the truth, then he is putting an enormous cost on small and family businesses that will force them to lay off staff. That is not good for the Australian economy.

Our Government is about jobs and we've got the record on jobs. Over 1.25 million jobs have been created under the policies that have backed small and family businesses over the last five and a half years. And we're going to create another 1.25 million over the next five years by keeping to those policies. The way you increase wages is you have a strong economy and lower taxes.

Bill Shorten wants to put up taxes on all Australians, $200 billion worth of higher taxes on the economy over the next 10 years. That will suffocate the economy and businesses like the ones that you see out here today.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister [inaudible] the Government’s decision to change it’s position on mortgage broker commissions, is it [inaudible] policy?

PRIME MINISTER: No, actually it was basic fairness and sitting down and consulting with the industry. There’s a very clear position when it comes to mortgage brokers and I commissioned a report from the Productivity Commission when I was Treasurer which came back and recommended basically keeping the status quo when it came to arrangements for mortgage brokers. So there was a series of advice before the Government, mortgage brokers basically help customers get the best deal when it comes to their mortgages and they’re not left basically naked to the big banks. Our concern was after having responded to the Royal Commission, having sat down with the industry to work through implementation issues on talking action on the Royal Commission, that the best thing for us to do was not to leave customers exposed by ensuring that mortgage brokers were weaker. Mortgage brokers, there’s some 25,000 people who work in mortgage broking businesses around the country and many of them are just sole operator businesses, many of them are female sole operator businesses. We want to see the mortgage broking industry continue to thrive, so under our plan they’ll have the status quo when it comes to the commissions and others so they can continue to run their businesses. It’ll be looked at again in three years and we’re backing the mortgage brokers in, because because they back the mortgage owners in - those looking to buy a home and get the best deal out of their mortgage. Labor wants to pull the rug out from under them, so I think mortgage brokers and those who rely on them can have a very clear choice; we’re backing the mortgage brokers, Labor is backing the big banks.

JOURNALIST: The Greens will say climate change is a key issue coming up to the election, what is the key issue for you, the stand out issue going into the next election?

PRIME MINISTER: The biggest issue is always, how do you continue to drive forward a strong economy? Because with a strong economy you can pay for hospitals. With a strong economy you can put 2,000 medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. You can pay for schools, you can pay for your environmental policies like our Climate Solutions Fund, our Community Environment Program which invest in the wellbeing of our environment and meeting our emissions reduction targets by 2030. Now it’s been several weeks now, almost three weeks since I came to Melbourne and I outlined in some detail how our Government is going to meet it’s emissions reduction targets by 2030. I went through it tonne by tonne.

Bill Shorten still cannot tell the Australian people how he intends to meet his reckless target of 45 per cent, that will cost wage earners some $9,000 a year, push up electricity prices at the wholesale level by 56 per cent, and cost jobs. Now, he needs to explain it. He can’t even answer the most basic question about whether he will use the carry over credits - which I’ve been very up front about, we earned those credits as a Government because we overachieved and will overachieve on the 2020 Kyoto targets. Now Bill Shorten can’t tell people today whether he’s using those carry over credits or not, to meet his targets, then he doesn’t have a policy. It is the most basic question when it comes to climate policy that I could nominate to you. It’s very simple; are you going to use them or not, Bill? Be up front with the Australian people about your climate policy, what it’s going to cost in jobs, how you’re going to achieve it. I’ve certainly done that, I’ve been very transparent about it because I think Australians deserve to know how their Government is going to meet their commitments on climate change and carbon abatement. We’ve got our policies in place and they’ll work.

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible] today about an Australian-born Islamic State bride who wants to return home with her baby daughter. Do you support her returning?

PRIME MINISTER: The great tragedy of those who went and joined up with terrorists, to support terrorist causes through Daesh and have taken their families into warzones where they’re basically fighting against Australia, is they have placed their children in this horrendous position. Now, they have to take responsibility for those decisions to join up with terrorists who are fighting Australia. I’m not going to put any Australian at risk to try to extract people from those situations. They have made their decisions and if they’re Australian citizens, if they are Australians citizens, well, there is a process for us to deal with them under Australian law and they will face the full force of Australian law should they be in a position to try to come back to Australia.

JOURNALIST: Does that mean [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: Temporary exclusion orders we have put into the Parliament, which are important laws, effectively work like a probation or parole if you like, when people return, to be placed under reporting arrangements. Now I think the children are innocent victims in the terrorist acts of their parents and we’ve seen some despicable acts, Khaled Sharrouf the worst of all in what he did with his children. But you know, they’re Australian citizens, they’ll face the full force of Australian law and I am not going to put –

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible]

PRIME MINISTER: Well the Australian Government will take it’s decisions on each and every case, but where an Australian citizen is seeking to return to Australia, there are arrangements to provide for that but it would be done basically, coming back to face charges for the crimes that they’ve been involved in by supporting terrorist acts, providing comfort and support to those and encouragement and seeking to incite terrorist acts in Australia.

So, if you’re coming home, you’re coming home to face the full force of the law.

The great tragedy is how children get caught up in the crimes against Australia, of their parents.

JOURNALIST: Why have you taken such a keen interest in preselection for Reid?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, when we’re in a position about that matter, we will - 

JOURNALIST: Do you hold out hope that Craig Laundy will run?

PRIME MINISTER: When I’m in a position to make announcements about that, I will.

JOURNALIST: Are you wanting to parachute someone into his seat?

PRIME MINISTER: Same answer. Thanks very much, it’s great to have Katie and Gladys here and to get a bit of a cooking lesson from Glayds on some of the produce back here as well. I want to thank these businesses, I want to thank the Markets particularly for having us here today. We’re going to back these businesses in every single day of the week. Bill Shorten would let them down.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, it’s great to be here in St Mary’s today with the Premier of course, Gladys Berejiklian and Stuart Ayres and our candidates here, Melissa and Sarah from Lindsay and Macquarie and of course we’ve got Alex Hawke here as well here in Western Sydney, out in Mitchell. The Western Sydney International Nancy Bird Walton Airport is a complete game-changer for Sydney, for New South Wales and for our country. This is something both the Premier and I have shared as a vision for many, many years. To see this project coming together now - just a week ago we were out naming the Airport, last year we were there turning the first sod at the Airport – to see it now become a reality after a generation and more of waiting, I think it’s an exciting time for Sydney. It’s an exciting time for our state and for our country.

These are the projects, these are the initiatives, this is the vision that builds the future of our country. I’m pleased to be here today with the Premier to say that as part of the announcement that was made yesterday, a $7 billion project to develop the North South Link and the works on the Airport to make sure that the Airport is rail ready at the time of it’s opening, the Commonwealth will be investing $3.5 billion in that project.                   

That $3.5 billion is made up of essentially three components. There is the further feasibility works that are being done over the balance of this year. There is the construction works being done, together with the State Government – that’s what we’re going to see more of - the construction works being done on two components and that's the New South Wales Stage 1 Link which centers right here in St Marys and secondly on the on-site work that is being done on the airport itself. Then, there is the Elizabeth Drive overpass as well, with some $61 million.

So this is a true partnership between the State and the Federal Government to make this project happen. I'm working with premiers right across the country to deliver important projects, whether it's here today where we have such a strong partnership to make these things happen here in New South Wales, or it's in Victoria, Western Australia or anywhere else in the country. Today, we were able to announce that we were concluding the Geelong City Deal with Premier Andrews and so we're signing that and here we are with the New South Wales Premier achieving what we need to achieve here. So thank you very much, Gladys. This has been a great team effort and I want to congratulate you for your launch yesterday. The visionary outlook you have for our State and the great team you’re taking forward, we could not be more pleased to be backing you and your team in, making your economy strong. Because when you make your economy strong, this is what you can do.

THE HON GLADYS BEREJIKLIAN MP, PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH WALES: Great, thank you PM. I want to thank the PM for confirming the $3.5 billion for this much-needed project. This is fantastic news for Western Sydney.

When I'm looking at the big picture, yes this is fantastic for New South Wales, but it’s also great for the nation. This is a nation-building project and the airport city that we are building around the Airport is going to be a game-changer for attracting jobs of the future, the research and development of the future and of course, being able to access that precinct with a rail line is just a complete game-changer.

I was very pleased to announce yesterday that the State Government will be contributing $2 billion towards this project over what we call the forwards, over the next three to four years and of course the balance of that money to make sure the first stage is completed by 2026 when the Airport is open. We always welcome extra funds, but we’re a Government that gets on with the job of delivering and only in May, we will see the people use the North West rail line for the first time, a metro rail system. Then, that will then offer a connection to this rail line and I'm really excited by that prospect, because what it means for Western Sydney is connection to jobs, connection to great universities, connection to the Airport obviously, but a complete game-changer for our state and I also believe for the nation.

THE HON STUART AYRES MP, MINISTER FOR WESTERN SYDNEY: This project completely changes the face of outer Western Sydney. It is the rail line that the outer Western Sydney community needs and has been demanding. Both the State and Commonwealth Governments are investing billions of dollars to bring jobs closer to where people live and it’s absolutely critical that they can access public transport to get to the locations where those jobs are. This is a game-changer for this community. It’s about making sure they have got the infrastructure they need to drive the economic prosperity and social opportunities that are needed here in Western Sydney. But also, it’s pumping the national economy. This is the stuff that really moves the dial and it brings jobs closer to where people live and really leverages the major, long-term decisions about an airport and this really makes sure that people understand it's not just an airport, it is actually about creating jobs closer to where people live.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you Stuart. Well as Gladys said yesterday, let's get it done.

PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH WALES: Absolutely.

PRIME MINISTER: That’s what we’re doing in New South Wales and the important thing about our governments is, we are getting it done together. The partnership that we have together is getting things done here in New South Wales, with Liberal-led Governments at state and federal level and we look forward to doing that into future. Happy to take questions obviously on the project and then we can move to other things.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when do you plan to get it done?

PRIME MINISTER: This will be ready at the time of the Airport being opened. So that's in a few years’ time in 2026 and that's the project. That's the project, that's what we've been working towards. We've already had site works happening already on Western Sydney International Airport, you've seen that. So it’s all underway and it’s all coming together and this is a critical component of the project.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister getting it done the way you want to requires both your governments being reelected. You've just lost the 50th Newspoll in a row, what are your thoughts?

PRIME MINISTER: We've got the plan and we've got the record of delivery. You know what, one of the things you do when you lead a government - and Gladys knows this very well - is you're never distracted by the noise. You just focus on the work you're doing for the people you work for. Which in Gladys' case is the people of New South Wales and for me, it’s all Australians. These projects are changing the lives and will change the lives of Australians for the better, in the future. So our plan is clear, our joint plans are clear and they will deliver for the people of Western Sydney, for New South Wales and Australia. So I just always remain focused on the job I've got and I never get distracted by the things at the fringes or the noise.

JOURNALIST: I guess it’s a question for both of you, with the polls where they are, what do you think it means for both of your campaigns, is the Liberal brand damaging your campaign at a state level and are you trying to perhaps, get a glow from the [inaudible]?

PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH WALES: I think it's fair to say that each of us are working hard in our own jurisdictions. My job as the Premier of New South Wales is working my guts out for our 8 million citizens, and of course the Prime Minister is focusing on the nation. That's what we’re elected to do and that's what we continue to do.

PRIME MINISTER: Australians, I think, are very sensible. Australians at the end of the day will make a judgement in a couple of weeks' time about what’s right for New South Wales and they will see the track record of the New South Wales Government has delivered on the ground and importantly, as we heard yesterday, services for the future. Our Government is following the same path.

We have cleaned up the mess that Labor left behind, just as the State Government had to clean up the mess that Labor left behind.

We will hand down the first surplus Budget on the 2nd of April, in 12 years.

We have got employment levels back in this country, to levels higher than were achieved by the Howard Government, after they fell under the Labor Government.

We've been rebuilding from the losses and the waste and the mismanagement of Labor years. Now, as is the case in New South Wales, they’re are in a position to re-invest in those services and that's what a strong economy is all about. It’s about giving yourself the capacity to invest in the health and the education services - which is exactly what Gladys announced yesterday with some incredibly exciting projects. That’s what you can do when you have a strong economy. 

Under Labor, the economy will be weaker. Wages can't grow in an economy that is weaker and taxes are higher. So I think Australians will weigh that up in the weeks ahead and there’s plenty of time between now and the election to do that.

JOURNALIST: But that's clearly not cutting through, why is your government so unpopular?

PRIME MINISTER: Look, there have been plenty of distractions over the last couple of weeks, I don't deny that, but they haven't distracted me. I’ve just remained very focused on our agenda for the future, which is to keep our economy strong, to keep Australians safe and to bring Australians together. I believe that’s what Australians want to see for their future and that's what I remain focused on. I’ll be focused on it every day, every day, undistracted from here to the election. Because Australians know that I don't get distracted by the noise and I will remain absolutely focused on what matters most to them.

JOURNALIST: Would you like to see Barnaby Joyce as the Leader of the National Party?

PRIME MINISTER: We have a fantastic leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack and there will be no change to that.

JOURNALIST: Are you concerned about that being a distraction [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: As I said, I don’t get distracted.

JOURNALIST: What about the idea of a leadership spill, surely that’s the last thing [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: I think that’s all nonsense.

JOURNALIST: But what about [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: I think that’s all nonsense, I think we have the Deputy Prime Minister in Michael McCormack. I mean this is what Michael and I have been focused on, this is what matters to people; Michael and I have been focused on the drought, as Gladys has been focused on the drought. That's what people in rural and regional areas are interested in at the moment, the drought. Rebuilding the livestock industry in North Queensland, that's where our focus has been. That's what we're 100 per cent focused on and I believe that is what people - whether it's in North Queensland, Central Queensland, outer Western New South Wales, Gippsland in Victoria where I was recently with drought-affected farmers down in that part of the State - they're interested in that. That's what I'm interested in and that's what we will continue to focus on and I know that's what Michael is focused on. So that's where we will be every single day.

Australians will see that and they will have a clear choice, a very clear choice; a Morrison-led Liberal and National Government at a federal level or a Bill Shorten-led Labor government. Here it’s the same; a Gladys Berejiklian-led Liberal Government here in New South Wales, or a Daley-led Labor government in New South Wales. These are very clear choices for the people to make in New South Wales and at a national level. We are very confident about the plans we’re putting forward and the judgement of Australians to make the right choice.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister just on energy, when will we find out whether there will be new coal-fired generation [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: Look, we have a process we're working through, but what I know is this; for such a project to proceed, it would require the approval of the Queensland State Government. Now, the Queensland State Government has no intention of approving any such projects at all. So I tend to work in the area of the practical, the things that actually can happen. What actually can happen is the investments that we’re making in renewable projects and reliable projects - which have been the Snowy

2.0 project which I mentioned yesterday as well as the Marinus Link project in Tasmania, which connects up to the pumped hydro projects in Tasmania - because these things actually will happen, actually can happen.

See, governments have to focus on what they will actually do and can actually deliver and that's what I'm focused on, not in hypothetical debates. I'm focused on things that we can actually do to keep the pressure downward on power prices and ensure that we deliver the reliable and sustainable and renewable energy for the future. That's what our Government is putting forward.

Thanks very much. Great to be here.DOORSTOP, SCARBOROUGH WA

VINCE CONNELLY, LIBERAL CANDIDATE FOR STIRLING: Good morning and welcome to Scarborough Beach. It's fantastic to be here with the Prime Minister also with Liberal candidate for Cowan Isaac Stewart. We're here in Scarborough right in the heart of Stirling, we’re at the state Surf Lifesaving Championships. My own children are members of the club here in Scarborough and I look forward to some of the action of today. Over to you, welcome PM.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you. Thank you very much Vince, it's great to be here with you and with Isaac. And it's great to be having such strong candidates here running here in WA. We'll be selecting another one tomorrow, another great candidate I am sure will come out of that process and Vince, particularly your veterans status and your service. We thank you for that and the opportunity to seek to have another veteran to come into the Parliament here I think you will be tremendous. And Isaac, the work you've done in the community. We're out there the other day at Wanneroo and that was really exciting to see that the great support that you will be able to bring together in the multicultural communities of Western Australia.

Well it's been an exciting few days here in WA, in Perth. I love coming to WA, I always have for decades. It's a place I feel very at home at because of the values and the culture of self-reliance but supporting those around you, giving people a hand up not a handout. This is the culture of Western Australia, that pioneering state and that's why I'm always pleased to be here. And just to reaffirm the values that made this state as strong as it is and we've got the people here in Western Australia who've been representing the Liberal Party and into the future as well to continue to champion all of these values.

So over the course of the week whether it was out at Henderson, we were all observing the work of some $900 million being invested in keeping our frigates up to speed, up to standard, $1.5 billion being invested in the infrastructure and supporting our naval shipbuilding industry there, creating intergenerational jobs. But I've got to tell you, the highlight for the week for me was not just also going out to Campbell and to the SAS regiment there and meeting with the brave men and women whose serve us in uniform as Vince has. I've got to say the Esther Foundation completely, completely captured my heart this week. This is an organisation that is transforming women's lives at the most practical level by ensuring that they understand something that can never be taken away from any woman and that is their unique value. Their unique worth. And the Esther Foundation, which we were pleased to invest $4 million to support that organisation over the next seven years will continue to do tremendous work. And I thank Ken Wyatt for the great job he's done in supporting that organisation.

But also to be out there with Steve Irons and Andrew Hastie announcing congestion-busting projects here in Perth and in the surrounding areas. Up there with Christian Porter the other night at the Hen which was a great night so I can only commend you if you're up that way, pop into the Hen it's a great business which has been established in recent years. All of this tells about the heart and the soul and the drive and entrepreneurial spirit of the Western Australian people. So it's been tremendous to be here. They're the values that the Liberal Party stands for. They are so aligned with the spirit and drive of Western Australia. You couldn't get two things more closely aligned and so we thank the people of Western Australia, I do, for the way that they continue to stand up for those values. And I've got to tell you, they're on display up there today at the WA State Championships for surf lifesaving. I come from a part of Sydney which has got four great surf clubs and the great thing about them is they teach not just the competitive elements of sport and keeping healthy and fit, but there's the element of service. A service culture which is breathed right throughout the surf lifesaving movement and any opportunity I have to acknowledge that I will take it and support it in any way my Government can.

So thanks for the opportunity to be here over course the week. Looking forward to meeting with the State Council later this morning and having a bit more to say to them. And this is the way we make Australia stronger, by honouring the values and spirit of what is alive and well here in Western Australia.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when will you be coming back to WA?

PRIME MINISTER: In the not too distant future, I can assure you. Try, you can't keep me away from the place. You really can't. And that's because I believe in what WA is doing. I always have. That's why I took the stand I did on the GST. Because you know, Western Australians aren't looking to succeed at someone else's expense. Western Australians have always sought to succeed in their own right. And that's why I did what I did on the GST, because Western Australians were getting held back. And Australia can't be stronger if Western Australians are getting held back. No part of Australia can be stronger, Australia can never be stronger if we're going to try and hold some Australians back, hold some down under the pretence that you're trying to help someone else. I want to see and continue to see Australia where we allow all of our industries to go forward, all Australians to go forward.

JOURNALIST: Will the Government be announcing further personal income tax cuts before the election?

PRIME MINISTER: Our government, and both as Treasurer and as Prime Minister, I've always championed personal income tax reductions. Reductions in income tax for businesses, particularly small and family businesses. And I'll tell you why. I want Australians to earn more. And I want Australians to keep more of what they earn. That's the difference between me and Bill Shorten. I want Australians to keep more of what they earn and I want them to be in a stronger economy where they can earn more. And what Bill Shorten said in the last couple of days, basically putting further burdens on the small and family businesses that employ countless number of Australians and effectively making them choose who will stay and who will get to go under the sort of industrial relations policies that the Labor Party is supporting at the behest of the unions. I mean, the problem I have with how Bill Shorten deals with the unions is not his strength, it's his weakness. See, when you're weak as he is in the face of the unions, that's when the unions completely take charge. I respected Bob Hawke as a Labor leader and I respected him as someone who led a union movement because he was in charge of it. And he would take responsibility for it. He deregistered the BLF. He took strong positions on militant unions. Bill Shorten hands out life memberships to militant unions and takes their money in the form of the CFMMEU. I mean, he takes that thug money from militant unions every single election. So Bill Shorten cannot stand up to the unions, just like he cannot stand up to people smugglers and he cannot be able to stand up to those who would form part of his government that allow spending to be rampant, which means taxes on Australians can only increase. Whether on retirees or on smaller family businesses and those investing for their future on investing in their superannuation. I want Australians to keep more of what they earn. Bill Shorten wants to take more from Australians from what they earn.

JOURNALIST: You say you want them to keep more, but does that mean you’re considering further tax cuts to what you’ve already announced?

PRIME MINISTER: My record on income tax is plain for everyone to see. Every opportunity I have to reduce the tax burden on Australians, I take it.

JOURNALIST: Will any many major budget cuts be needed to deliver the surplus?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

JOURNALIST: Why is David Coleman reversing his Department's ban on Milo Yiannopoulos coming to Australia?

PRIME MINISTER:  There's a process that has followed in relation to character issues regarding people who wish to come to Australia and the Minister has been following that normal process. There have been decisions taken to date by the Department and it is open to the Minister to play a role in that process where he believes that it is necessary to do so. So we've just been simply following that process. Free speech is important in Australia. But people have to be responsible for what they say. Free speech is actually for Australian citizens by the way. And I think anyone who comes to Australia should show respect for all Australians. And I would certainly hope that anybody who's come here would show that respect from whatever country you come from, if you come to Australia you come as a visitor. I mean this is one of the reasons why my Government - and I started the process as Immigration Minister - if you come here on a visa and if you commit a crime, you'll go to jail. And after you've got out of jail, you'll go home. Now we've done that on over 4,000 occasions of people who have violated the generosity of Australians in allowing them to come and visit our country. Now our tourism industry is one of our greatest employers and we want to see that continue to thrive and grow as it is. But when people come to our country, we expect them to respect Australia and Australians, our values, our multicultural society. And so on that issue, this is just the normal process following through. The Minister has allowed that process to go to this point and he will make a decision on this issue shortly. And I think that will just be the normal working of that process.

JOURNALIST: Do you stand by your comments about women yesterday?

PRIME MINISTER: I want all Australians to support the advancement of women. That's what I was saying yesterday. I want all Australians to support the advancement of women. And that's why I want to see an agenda that supports women like our $328 million investment to combat domestic violence in Australia. That's a cause every Australian, men and women, must get behind. I'm just simply saying that I want to see this agenda pursued with Australians working together to achieve it, with men championing it as much as women championing it. Because that's my experience. As a father of two daughters, I have three wonderful women in my life with Jen and my two girls and I'm a champion for women for them out of direct self-interest, I’ve got to say, but for all women across the country. And so what I was saying yesterday was I don't want to see this agenda pursued by setting women against men, no. Australian against Australian, no. I want to bring all Australians together to focus on this. That's what my meaning was yesterday. And that's what I'm fair dinkum about. I want to see all Australians promote the advancement and wellbeing of women in this country together, not apart. Thanks very much. REMARKS, INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY WOMEN IN RESOURCES BREAKFAST

PRIME MINISTER: ... today on International Women’s Day, a very exciting day. I also acknowledge the Noongar people, the elders past, present and emerging. Can I particularly acknowledge indigenous women today and can I acknowledge their bravery, their courage for the way that they have, over generations, over centuries, been there for their families and for their people. Indigenous women are a very special group of people in this country and earlier this week, I had the opportunity to announce the largest ever package of support in relation to domestic violence against women. And a key part of that was supporting Indigenous women in this country. And particularly here amongst the mining industry, I want to acknowledge the mining industry for the great work that they do right across - not just this state - but right across the country in supporting indigenous Australians, both with employment opportunities. But they're a great partner on these important social programs as well. A terrific partner. So I want to acknowledge the mining industry for that.

It's great to be here also amongst the mining industry on this day for a couple of reasons. First of all is because of the great achievements that I think have been achieved here in the minerals industry when it comes to the advancement of women. Now, I have been doing a bit of advancement of women lately myself. And Linda Reynolds is here as evidence and proof of that, joined by Melissa Price and Michaelia Cash. There are now seven women in my Cabinet, which is the highest number of women ever in a Cabinet in Australia's history. The fact that three of them are from Western Australia - three out of the seven - I think speaks volumes about Western Australia.

[Applause]

And so it's great to have them all in my team. They're doing a tremendous job across a range of very difficult and very important portfolios. The other reason is because I understand - my Government understands, Mathias and I understand, and Steve, and Slade, who's here as well, that... you mentioned I had two girls. That's true. And what Jenny and I want for our girls is for them to have all the choices in life that you would hope that they would have. Mathias I know he feels the same way about his family and all of us do. And for them to have those choices, something has to happen. And that is our economy has to be strong. You look around the world, where women face their biggest challenges and struggles - they're in the developing countries of the world. Prosperity brings with it its opportunities, of course it does, for every person. But it particularly brings the ability and the power to be able to increase the standing and opportunities for women around the world. And that's true here in Australia.

And so I applaud the minerals industry for doing two things. One is contributing to Australia's prosperity. Not just here in Western Australia, but all around the country. The mining industry in Australia makes Australia stronger. That's why I support it. I know there are others who don't. I know there are others at the moment who want to attack the mining industry and talk it down, say that it doesn't have a future. That's just dead wrong. When you attack the mining industry, you are attacking Australia's economic future. Whether that's in North Queensland, whether it's here in Western Australia, whether it's in the Northern Territory, it doesn't matter where you are. If you're not a friend of the mining industry in Australia, you're not a friend of prosperity in Australia. And I'm a friend of prosperity in Australia, because I know what it delivers for Australians and I know what it particularly delivers for women in Australia. A more prosperous country is a stronger society where we can invest $328 million in countering and combating domestic violence in this country, where women can start businesses, grow, take opportunity that they're seeking, take ownership of their economic future. The programs like the Esther Foundation I was at yesterday can see young women reclaim their lives, reclaim the things that have been taken from them, by having the support of a generous society, because they raise their funds from a generous community and they're supported by us as well. So, a more prosperous country is good for Australia and it's particularly good for Australian women. And to have a more prosperous country, you've got to have, in this country, a very strong minerals sector. So, that's the other reason I was very keen to be here today.

One of the other female members of my Cabinet, Kelly O'Dwyer, said at the Press Club last year, our Minister for Women, “Gender equality isn't about pitting girls against boys.” See, we're not about setting Australians against each other, trying to push some down to lift others up. That's not in our values. That is an absolutely Liberal value, that you don't push some people down to lift some people up. And that is true about gender equality too. We want to see women rise. But we don't want to see women rise only on the basis of others doing worse. We want everybody to do better, and we want to see the rise of women in this country be accelerated to ensure that their overall pace is maintained. So Kelly said, "It isn't about pitting girls against boys or women against men. It's not about conflict," she said. "It's about recognising that girls and women deserve an equal stake in our economy and our society." And that's what we're achieving and we still have a long way to go. It's a powerful message that we all need to understand.

CME, in its efforts to highlight the achievements of women, particularly through the Women in Resources Awards, is to be something to be absolutely commended. I'm looking forward to meeting some of the nominees today. The Inspiring Girls Initiative, which connects female students with women working in this industry, I think, is a tremendous initiative, showing them the range of opportunities that they can grab if they want a career in mining and energy. And we want to ensure that they have the opportunity to have careers in this industry and in so many others. A job-creating economy will make our families stronger, it will make our communities stronger.

Last year, we released the landmark Women's Economic Security Statement. It's about backing women to boost their skills and employability, start their own businesses, and importantly give women more options to secure their financial independence when they need it, whether they are starting a career, a family, or in retirement. Increased flexibility for paid parental leave. Supporting entrepreneurship opportunities for women, and the STEM program for girls. And allowing catch-up superannuation contributions if returning to work after a break for family reasons. The Women's Economic Security Statement has been the next instalment of our delivering for women across Australia. The record level of female participation in the workforce, the record low in the gender pay gap in Australia, the record number of women going into jobs - more than half of the 1.2 million jobs, well over half, have gone to women. As our economy has grown, women have been going faster in terms of securing those opportunities, which we always want to see them achieve.

Now, Karen Andrews is one of the other female members of our Cabinet, and to the great thrill, I think, of most in this room, she's also an engineer.

[Laughter]

And they're the women we have in our team. From different backgrounds. Great skills. In business, in law, in the community, in the military, right across our team you will find women who have brought great skills and abilities. And we're selecting more, particularly since last August, and we've had 19 women now who have been selected as candidates. And coming into the Senate, Wendy Askew, from Tasmania, will be joining Mathias and the team when we're back in Parliament. She's formally taken up that position now. I'm pleased to see that happen. Of course, we've got further to go, but the women in our party who are achieving particularly out here in the west have been blazing the trail. And I know so many will follow in the trail that they've created for women in our Party. And my commitment as the leader of this Party is to ensure that continues and for it to gain momentum, for it to get stronger. I think that's the record I've demonstrated since taking over the job last year. I only want to see that continue to grow into the future.

So I wish everybody a very happy International Women’s Day and to remind everyone that the great state of Western Australia is a state that has for so long in our country driven out prosperity and we need to ensure that continues in this state and you cannot do that unless you’re prepared to back the mining and resources industry in this country. If you’re not prepared to do that, you’re not prepared to back prosperity in this country. You’re not in a position to be able to support the services that Australian rely on and women rely on. How have we got the highest ever level of bulk billing in Medicare in Australia’s history? Because we’ve got a strong economy. How have we got 2,000 medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for ovarian cancer, breast cancer, all of these incredibly life-destroying illnesses? Because we’ve got a strong economy. And so my plan is to focus on ensuring that we have a strong economy in the future, because I believe that will advance women’s interests here in this country and the program we’ve got to accelerate women’s interest in this country will only see a stronger future for my girls, for all of your girls and all the girls who are here. Happy International Women’s Day.DOORSTOP, HAZELMERE WA

Congestion busting; WA EPA; Malcolm Turnbull; Christmas Island; 2030 emissions targets; ACTU protests; Election trends.
THE HON STEVE IRONS MP, MEMBER FOR SWAN: Well good morning everyone, we’re down in Swan in my electorate and it’s great to have my West Australian colleagues here along with the Prime Minister of Australia. And it’s always good to have him in Swan, particularly when he is announcing congestion busting funding, particularly for the area you will see behind here is Abernathy Road - just a bit of a compliment there. Anyway, it’s great to have him here with my colleagues and for him to do this announcement. So I’d like to welcome to the microphone, Scott where are you? Come forward and tell us about this great congestion busting funding.

PRIME MINISTER: Well thanks very much Steve. It’s great to be here in Western Australia today, as I have been for the last couple of days and to be announcing our congestion-busting package here in and around Perth. Some $95 million, just slightly over that, to focus on some key projects. Now, our congestion-busting fund is all about ensuring that Australians can get home sooner, safer. They can get to work sooner, safer. Those who are working out on our roads every day, tradies and others, spend more time on site than they do sitting in traffic jams. It is also about understanding and planning for the future. Andrew Hastie is here today. One of the projects we’re announcing is a new train station down his way, is about ensuring a new growth area is getting the link-up to the rail network which is incredibly important.

So all of these projects that we’ve been announcing around the country are about responding to the pressures of population growth across our cities all across the country. But they've all been identified quite strategically and surgically by our local Members. Our local Members understand the projects that need to be addressed, whether it's the traffic hot-spots, the unsafe intersection, the need for the right turn lane here or the widenings of roads which we're talking about particularly here today. That's what the project is designed to do. And those needs are as important here in Perth as they are in any other part of the country, where we have seen new development and opportunities that have to be seized by putting this infrastructure in place. The four projects we’re announcing today is the $50 million to rollout the next section of the widening of the Kwinana and Mitchell freeways, $20 million towards extending Lloyd Street in Hazelmere to ease congestion caused by limited freight access, I was out there with Ken the other day and seeing that project firsthand. Here in Steve's electorate in Swan we’ve got $13.25 million to upgrade a three kilometre stretch on Abernathy Road. Further down south from here as I said with Andrew we’ve got $10 million towards construction of the Lakelands Station on the Mandurah rail line and there's $2.5 million to bust congestion at the Shorehaven Boulevard/Marmion Avenue intersection at Alkimos to improve peak traffic times.

Now these are all very practical projects that will make a very real difference, partnering together with the state government. I’m meeting with the Premier later today to discuss a number of issues and I’m sure this will be one. But I’ll tell you, one of the things it will enable the state government to help support these projects and we're happy to be involved in these projects in our announcements today is $1.3 billion in extra revenue will be coming to the state of Western Australia next year alone because of the GST fairness deal I was able to land as Treasurer, legislate as Prime Minister and now ensure is honoured with the cheques turning up to make sure the state government is in a position which they’ve never been in before as a state government to be assured of the fair GST share that enables them to invest in the services and projects that are critically important to the future of Western Australia.

The other thing I wanted to mention today is that we're investing up to just under $100 million here and we're investing over a billion dollars in this initiative all around the country. Our priorities are about busting congestion, growing our economy, defending Australia through building our defence capability. I was out at Henderson earlier this week driving our economy forward with lower taxes. These are our priorities.

It is International Women's Day today. Earlier this week I announced just over $320 million in the biggest-ever plan, the Fourth National Action Plan to combat domestic violence. And so these are our priorities as the Government. It was revealed today the Labor Party wants to actually increase the refugee and humanitarian intake that will cost Australians $6.2 billion over the next 10 years. So they're going to tax retirees, they’re going to tax retirees through their retirees tax to pay for increased refugee intake in Australia. Now, we have a very credible and very worthy program for refugee and humanitarian intake here in Australia, over 18,000 we take every single year. Since we were first elected to Government, more than 7,000 women and children that have come under the Women At Risk Program that we were able to expand because we were able to get our borders under control. So we have a credible and reputable program here in welcoming people through the front door. But when it comes to setting priorities, we're not going to increase that intake because we want to invest those funds in projects like the one we're seeing here to ensure that we continue our record health and education spending and we're certainly not going to tax Australians higher through things like the retiree tax which is basically from robbing senior Australians, their hard-earned investment and what they've provided for in their retirement so they wouldn't have to lean on other Australians at that time. So I’m going to hand over to Mathias, his Department has costed that initiative in particular, but to make further comment.

SENATOR THE HON MATHIAS CORMANN, MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE: Thank you very much Prime Minister. It is great to have the Prime Minister here in Western Australia, making this announcement today. This announcement of $100 million towards further congestion-busting infrastructure here across Perth builds on about $4 billion worth of Federal infrastructure investments that we have made here into Western Australia over the last two years. Including $2.3 billion in federal funding to support the rollout of the METRONET project here across Perth. It is also particularly good to have Scott Morrison here in Western Australia as our Prime Minister because Scott Morrison is and was the architect of the GST fix for WA. He is the architect of a plan that has delivered and will continue to deliver a fairer and better share of GST revenue here into Western Australia, which will make a positive difference to the people and the families here in Western Australia for many, many years to come.

In relation to the Labor policy to further increase what is already a very generous refugee intake here in Australia. Australia on a per capita basis, has the second most generous level of refugee intake anywhere in the world, only second to Canada. Bill Shorten's decision to increase that further by taking the Government-funded places from 17,750 to 27,000 will cost about $6.2 billion over the decade from 2019-20. Do not be fooled by any suggestions that somehow the costs will be half. In making that false assertion, Labor is relying on costings that are three years old, when only one year over a four-year estimates period was actually part of that particular initiative, when the full four years of that particular proposal would now hit the Budget bottom line and another three years of that particular proposal would hit our medium term costings. $6.2 billion in higher expenditure to boost what is already a very generous refugee intake into Australia. But at the same time, Bill Shorten is standing in the way of a $3.9 billion Drought Future Fund, designed to help drought-stricken communities across Australia drought-proof their communities. Bill Shorten’s priorities are wrong. He should change his particular approach to this. He should get out of the way when it comes to legislating the Drought Future Fund and he should reconsider all his other high spending and high taxing proposals as well.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks Mathias. Now Andrew, come and tell us about your station. I mean, I know we're a bit out of Canning today. But this is part of the congestion-busting project and your electorate has been one of those really fast-growing areas of Western Australia. A lot of families, a lot of communities. Tell me what the new station will mean?

ANDREW HASTIE MP, MEMBER FOR CANNING: So it's 10 million for the Lakelands Train Station. As you know, my seat is outer metro/regional. You’ve got a heart for those seats. and high growth, a lot of congestion, a lot of seniors living in the Lakelands catchment and surrounds, a lot of working families. So this will mean that people can walk to the station, get on a train, and head up to the city. So economic and social mobility means they don’t have to drive south to Mandurah to then go north to the city and it’s a big life-changer for a lot of young people in my electorate, so thank you, PM.

PRIME MINISTER: Well it is basic infrastructure for what a growing city needs and Perth is a growing city and it’s got a huge future, a big future. Happy to take questions on congestion-busting then we can move to any other topics you would like to cover.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you were a little late to the press conference this morning, did you get a small taste of Perth congestion?

PRIME MINISTER: I thought I was pretty close to time, to be honest but, anyway, thanks for noticing. It's… look, Perth has been a growing city for a long time. I've been coming here for decades. I've seen its rapid transformation, I’ve seen its great prosperity, I’ve seen it going through more difficult times recently on the other side of the mining investment boom. But the thing I love about Western Australia is you're always about wanting to grow more, you’re always wanting to seize those opportunities. And what we’re here to do today is back in that culture, that attitude here in Western Australia. I don't want to see Western Australians held back by not having a train station or not having a widened road or not having the GST, which is their fair share. That's why, I think, Western Australians can trust me as a Prime Minister because they've put me to the test on these issues and I've been able to deliver. I think that shows good faith for a pro-growth, pro-infrastructure plan for the development of Western Australia, in particular, Perth's future.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister just on a different issue, the WA EPA has made a decision that all major projects here are to be carbon neutral. Can we get your reaction to that and should the McGowan government have nipped this in the bud before it was even announced?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, it has been let to run a little while, I certainly acknowledge. I understand the Premier has made some comments about that today. I'm sure, having heard Paul Everingham today from the Mines and Energy Chamber, looking for greater certainty on that issue. But I’ll tell you what I'm more worried about - this is actually what Bill Shorten wants to do across the entire country. Mark McGowan may well see sense on this issue but I can assure you that Bill Shorten won't. What Bill Shorten is seeking to do with his own environmental agency is to writ large what the threat has been here with these types of changes that have been mooted in the last few days. And they want to wed it up to a 45 per cent emissions reduction target which will see wage earners in this country over the next 10 years stand to lose every single year $9,000 a year. So I don’t understand how Bill Shorten can on one hand say he wants to improve people’s wages and then on the other hand, he’s got an emissions reductions target which will rip $9,000 out of their pockets based on the independent assessments that has been done on his emissions reduction target. So what we see from Labor is they never learn. They said they weren’t going to introduce tax but did. And it took our Government, upon election, as we promised, to get rid of it.

Bill Shorten has now got carbon taxes on steroids awaiting the Australian people. To go with the retirees' tax, the housing taxes, the taxes on savings on your superannuation, your taxes on small businesses, and now we have the even bizarre situation where he wants to take Australia's workplace and industrial relations system back to a time of conflict and division. You know, we don't become a more prosperous people, you don't grow a stronger economy by setting Australians against each other in the workplace. And the union movement are laying the markers, they are laying the ground to tell Bill Shorten what he must do if he were to become Prime Minister. We’ve already seen he's a complete pushover when it comes to border protection policy. So you can only understand what he would do in the face of union pressure in he were to be Prime Minister. It would not be good for jobs. Small and family businesses would have to be deciding who to let go under a Shorten Government. That is not good for anybody's wage when you lose the whole thing.

JOURNALIST: Is Malcolm Turnbull right? Is he more popular than you and should the Party have dumped him?

PRIME MINISTER: I'll leave the history to the historians and those who like to talk about history because I'm interested in the future of Australia. What we've been doing as a Government for the last five and a half years is building that stronger economy to guarantee the essential services Australians rely on. We've been investing in making Australia a safer country, safer not just on our borders, safer not just by the biggest recapitalisation of our defence forces since the Second World War, safer for women as we've invested the biggest package on combating domestic violence in the country, safer for young kids online and safer from bullying investments that we've been making. We have a plan to continue this all into the future. Stronger, safer, together - Australia will be a more prosperous country. That's good for all Australians. So that's where we're heading. I'll let the historians squabble over the past.

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible]

PRIME MINISTER: I can't quite hear you?

JOURNALIST: You indicated earlier this week that you expected the Christmas Island detention centre to be operating at a fairly high capacity for several years. In four years’ time, the people who are there will have been in detention for 10 years in total. Is that acceptable and what is the long-term plan for this project?

PRIME MINISTER: The estimates we've got for the reopening of Christmas Island are based on the worst-case scenario of how many people we might see come there. As you know, the advice that was given to us is by making it really clear that people who might be seeking to take advantage of Labor's weakening of the border protection regime through Shorten's law on undermining regional processing, that making it very clear if you seek to game that system and use the loopholes, you won't be coming to mainland Australia. You'll be seeing the inside of a hardened detention facility on Christmas Island. Now I suspect that will have some impact on dissuading those who want to game the system from seeking to game the system. And I certainly hope that’s the outcome and that’s the meaning behind what I’ve said. That I would hope to see the centre doesn't get that sort of patronage. But if it did, then it's able to deal with that. If people are seeking to game the system and then not return to where they should return to after they've received any assessment that is deemed necessary, well, they'll remain there by their own choice.

JOURNALIST: Back to Malcolm Turnbull's comments, are they helpful this close to the election?

PRIME MINISTER: I'm not really distracted by them at all. See, I'm focused on what I need to do for the future of the country. I don't get distracted by all the bubble noise on these things. I know others do. I know it's terribly interesting to all of those who write inside the bubble. Australians don't live in the bubble. Australians live out here where you want your roads upgrades, where you want jobs, where you want to ensure small and family businesses have a future. These are the things that are outside the bubble. I'll leave what belongs in the bubble, in the bubble.

JOURNALIST: The EPA says it felt that it had to intervene, the EPA said it felt it had to intervene because the Federal Government had failed to do what it called ‘the heavy lifting’ on climate policy. Is that fair?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I think that completely rubbish. I mean, we will meet our carbon abatement targets for 2030 as we have set out in our plan and the commitments that we've made. I've actually set it out from today all the way to 2030. Whether it's the Climate Solutions Fund, whether it’s Snowy 2.0, whether it’s the energy efficiency measures, the Battery of the Nation, Marinus Link, the technology improvements. I can give you a tonne by tonne description of how we meet our 26 per cent emissions reductions targets. The question I have for Bill Shorten is it's been almost two weeks and he has still not done the same. So the question to Bill Shorten is: How do you achieve your 45 per cent emissions reductions targets? What are the measures? What are the impacts on the industries? How many aluminium smelters are going to be closed down, whether it's in Victoria or North Queensland? What is going to happen to our major power stations? Are they going to be shutdown? See, I've been transparent with Australians about our climate policy. They know exactly what our targets are and exactly how we’re going to meet them. Bill Shorten has answered none of these questions. He has a 45 per cent emissions reduction target. On best case for him that means he needs to abate more than three times the amounts of carbon emissions than under our policy. So how are you going to do it Bill? Who are you lying to? The industries you’re going to close? Or those who may support that sort of a target and you’re never going to meet it. He can't be trusted whether it's on the GST or on the climate.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, remind us who signed Australia up to the Paris Agreement?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, the original target was set under the Abbott Government and it was signed under the Turnbull Government.

JOURNALIST: So Mr Abbott has backtracked on that issue, he says that we don’t need to withdraw from Paris Climate because there is a new Prime Minister. So can we trust politicians when they change their minds so often?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, our policy hasn't changed. Our policy has been exactly the same since we came to Government. It hasn't changed at all. As Prime Minister, I have continued the policy of the 26 per cent emissions reduction target. I sat in the Cabinet that set it. I sat in the Cabinet that signed it. And as Prime Minister, I have the plan to achieve it.

JOURNALIST: Just on industrial relations, the ACTU is planning an anti-Coalition day of protest next month. What do you say about that and do you think it’s time for business to campaign in this upcoming election campaign, to add their voice to this debate?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I'll leave that to them. What I know is the union movement under Sally McManus - who has no respect for the rule of law in this country - that's not my accusation. That's her own confession. She is now taking Australia to a conflict footing that we have not seen in this country for decades, for absolute decades. Now, I don't think you make Australia stronger by the type of militant conflict-based approaches of a union movement that has been emboldened by the weakness of Bill Shorten. When Bob Hawke was the Prime Minister, when he was the leader of the Labor Party, he could largely control the unions. The unions will run Bill Shorten. Bob Hawke ran the unions but the unions will run Bill Shorten. And they're marking out their ground, and they’re rolling up their sleeves, and they’ve got all their shouts and slogans all ready to go and they'll be marking it out for a period of industrial conflict in this country. Bill Shorten will roll over just like he did on our borders. That's a great threat to Australians' jobs, to the future prosperity of Australia, and to the services that they rely on, whether it's Medicare, hospitals or schools that depend on the strength of the economy. Never forget, it was the Labor Party that could not list affordable medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme because they couldn't manage money.

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible]

PRIME MINISTER: I couldn't hear, Michael?

JOURNALIST: During your visit here, you mentioned the 2007 election a few times when Western Australians largely bucked the trend and...

PRIME MINISTER: Well, they absolutely bucked the trend. Steve was elected in the 2007 election and two seats were won here in Australia. So we actually took seats off the Labor Party in 2007.

JOURNALIST: No, one.

PRIME MINISTER: No, it was two actually. It was Cowan and Swan.

JOURNALIST: I stand corrected. Anyway, the point being, are you banking on a similar sentiment this time around?

PRIME MINISTER: I'm backing Western Australians to be themselves. Western Australians are passionate about their opportunities and their future. They're not going to back $200 billion in taxes that will put lead in the saddlebags of their economy. They're not going to back Bill Shorten wanting to take the savings and incomes of retirees in this country to pay for an increased refugee take well above what is necessary in this country. Taxing retirees to take more refugees. That's Bill Shorten's policy. I think that tells you everything you want to know about his priorities. Western Australians want to see their state go ahead. Western Australians don't want to be held back. Under me, as Prime Minister, with my great Western Australian team, they are not being held back. They are being released. They've got their fair share of GST. We're investing in the infrastructure. We are building the ships that are supporting their naval industry here out at Henderson. We are driving their economy forward. We are expanding export deals which open up the opportunities for Western Australian businesses, particularly the mining and resources industry - an industry that Labor has previously tried to shut down with their higher taxes and now they want to shut down with their reckless emission reduction targets. So I'm backing Western Australians to be themselves and support the leadership they've come to expect from me and my Western Australian colleagues. Thanks very much.DOORSTOP, HENDERSON WA

NICOLE ROBINS, LIBERAL CANDIDATE FOR FREMANTLE: Good morning, my name is Nicole Robins, I’m the Liberal Candidate for Fremantle and it’s my pleasure to be down here this morning at BAE Systems in the electorate of Fremantle. I’m here this morning with Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Senator Linda Reynolds.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you very much. Well it’s great to be here in WA again. I have just come down, as you probably know, from Christmas Island last night where I can report the facilities have been stood up. The medical facilities have been put in place, they will respond to demand as is necessary. The estimated cost that people are aware of, that’s around about $1.4 billion over the next four years. But of course, that depends on the level of demand. So how much it ultimately costs - it could be much less than that, and I believe that the measures that we’ve put in place to ensure, wherever possible, what Labor has done in weakening our borders, we’ve been able to strengthen them so we can limit that cost and limit the number of people who would try and game the system and the loopholes. As you know, we’ve had to open Christmas Island on the advice of the Department of Home Affairs, their clear advice, that was given to us as well after Labor’s laws were passed through the Parliament. That was done on their advice, and that’s why we’re taking that forward. A key reason for that is also to deal with those who are on Manus Island now, and in other places you’ve seen in today’s media reports, and the declassified material, individuals that have been involved in seeing and posting material that is promoting terrorist causes, those who have been up on charges of rape and all sorts of hideous types of behaviour who should never be allowed to come to Australia. But because of Labor’s laws that they put through the Parliament, we will be forced to take should they go through that process. The only place they’re going to see is the inside of a room at Christmas Island’s hardened detention facility. They won’t be walking the streets of Perth, I can assure of that, so long as I’ve got something to say about it.

But it’s great to be here in Western Australia, and it’s great to bring $1.3 billion with me under the GST deal that you know I initiated as Treasurer, secured in legislation as Prime Minister and that ensures that Western Australia is getting the fair deal on the GST that they have deserved for a very long time. I’m very pleased to have played my role in that, Western Australians know where I stand on that issue because I promised and I delivered and on this visit, I can confirm that that additional top-up to get to the 70 cent mark will be provided and that’s $1.3 billion to support Western Australians. So the Western Australian state government can get on with providing the services that Australians rely on. My only request to the state government, to Premier Mark McGowan, is spend it wisely. You now have those resources, make sure it’s getting to the places that it needs to get to and that’s obviously a responsibility of the state government.

But here we are today at BAE Systems. And Minister Reynolds, my newly minted Cabinet Minister, and congratulations to you in your home state, Linda, for your elevation to the Ministry, to the Cabinet. This is part of an economic powerhouse that is needed to continue to drive our economy forward. A loan here to contract some $900 million for the sustainment, maintenance and upgrade of these frigates. Now these are intergenerational jobs that you are seeing sustained here and that will be created here for generations to come over the life of these sustainment and maintenance contracts. There are people who have been working here, as I learned this morning, for 32 years. Their children are also now working here. I’ve met apprentices this morning who are working here and I have no doubt they’ll have a long career here and their kids will work here too. Because of the long-term investment we’ve made in our naval ship building industry. Now in Western Australia specifically, there is $1.5 billion that is going to those projects and the setting up of the base infrastructure that is required to support that. You’ve got some $4 billion that is going into the offshore patrol vessels which are also being built here in Western Australia.

This is how you drive your economy forward. Our economy is facing stiff headwinds and that’s why you must have a plan, as we do, for lower taxes, supporting small and family businesses, expanding our export markets with the Indonesian Agreement signed only this week. But it’s also about supporting our traditional industries, our minerals and resources industries. Resources industries that Labor has always wanted to tax more and drive out of the industry, drive down our economy and we’re seeing that continue now with the Labor Party and Bill Shorten’s view which is hostile to our minerals and resources industries. But here in Western Australia, it’s also about our defence industry. The investments we’re putting into this industry will ensure jobs and growth for the future of the West Australian economy and our national economy. That’s how you drive wages forward, that’s how you drive jobs forward. You invest in projects like this and supporting contacts like the BAE which keep the Western Australian economy moving forward. So that’s my plan, that’s the plan I’m sticking to, investing in infrastructure, defence capabilities, to ensure the economy moves forward. So I’ll allow Linda to take you through some of the more precise elements of what’s happening here and then we’ll here from BA. Thank you.

LINDA REYNOLDS, MINISTER FOR DEFENCE INDUSTRY, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND NORTH QUEENSLAND RECOVERY: Well thank you very much Prime Minister and it’s wonderful to welcome you back here to Henderson. Today, there is no prouder Senator for Western Australia standing in front of the HMAS Perth and HMAS ANZAC behind us. Having both of these frigates being fully refitted by hundreds, actually thousands, of Western Australian workers here it is a very proud moment. As the Prime Minister said, we’ve got generations of Australian workers, Western Australian workers, working on these frigates. There is great capability across Australia in many industries to support our defence personal and as the new Defence Industry Minister, I am incredibly proud that there are so many West Australian workers here making sure that our men and women who serve in uniform here in Australia and overseas have the best possible equipment and ships that they can serve on.

So as the Prime Minister has said, this Government has committed over $2.5 billion in West Australian businesses and industry here. And that means that the men and women we have seen here today, their children, their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren will have work here on our naval ships. Not only in the build of the ships, which we’re very good at, we’re doing 31 of the 53 new service combatants and submarines that we’re building here in Australia. But most importantly for Western Australia is not only do we build and maintain defence vessels, we’ve also got a fantastic commercial ship building industry here. So what this additional investment in Henderson, in Garden Island and our defence industry means is that there will be thousands and thousands of West Australian jobs.

But also uniquely here in Western Australia, many of the men and women we have met here at BAE systems today and right across the Henderson strip have come out of the mining sector. So it is a great, sustainable way to keep all of these capabilities in Western Australia. So Prime Minister, welcome back and it’s wonderful to see you here.

LUKE SIMMONS, GENERAL MANAGER BAE HENDERSON: Welcome everyone, my name is Luke Simmons, I’m the General Manager of BAE Henderson. It’s been a pleasure to have the Prime Minister and Minister Reynolds here today. This is a great program that we’ve got here, upgrading and maintaining the ANZAC Class frigates. As mentioned earlier, we have generational people here. I’m third generation in the business and I’m proud to work in the defence force industry. We will be maintaining these vessels for the next 20 years of their life until the new Hunter Class frigates replace these frigates in the future. Thank you.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you very much Luke. Look, we’re happy to take questions obviously. Maybe we deal with the issues we’re here talking about sustainable maintenance contracts or defence procurement policy and defence industry and then happy to deal with any other issues you’d like.

JOURNALIST: On jobs generally, you mentioned jobs and wages going forward, but with economic growth stalling at 0.2 per cent, do you see wages growth as outside your control?

PRIME MINISTER: Wages growth will come with economic growth. Wages growth won't come with higher taxes, which is what Bill Shorten is proposing. Wages growth will come with continued growth in jobs and the strength of the economy. We're growing at over 2 per cent, 2.3 per cent, which is still outstripping the majority of developed economies in the G7. It's only the United States, I understand, ahead. I mean, there are very strong economic headwinds. I've been warning about that for some time and I think yesterday's national accounts are a reminder to Australians that economic growth cannot be taken for granted. That's why we're making these investments here in Western Australia in the defence industry. That's where it comes from. I mean Bill Shorten, when he talks about wages - the only wages I can be certain he's going to increase is the wages of people smugglers, because his policies will only see a boost to their incomes, while smashing the Australian Budget in the costs that we saw last time Labor were in power and their border protection debacles cost the country an extra $16 billion.

JOURNALIST: The RBA Governor says there's something deep and structural going on with wages growth. Can you identify what it is?

PRIME MINISTER: When I was Treasurer, a number of years ago, I gave a fairly detailed presentation on this topic and one of the things that had been going on in incomes and wages in our economy has been the hangover from the mining investment boom, where wages maintained at a particular level and there was a gap that needed to be closed between producer and consumer wages. Now, those two lines are now starting to come a lot closer together and as we've seen with wages growth over the last six months or so, as the Reserve Bank governor has illustrated, we have seen a turning point when it comes to wage growth. We now have wage growth running above 2 per cent. It was sub-2 per cent prior to that. And so the way to support wages growth in the future is to have lower taxes, to invest in infrastructure, to support small and family businesses, to grow the size of your export markets, which are so critical to the Western Australian economy. To support all industries, not just the bright, shiny new ones, which we do support, but to support industries like mining and resources and agriculture and forestry and fishing. These are big industries that support a lot of jobs and the Labor Party is walking away from these traditional industries to chase the support of the Greens and others. Not the Liberal Party. We want to see all our industries go forward, particularly our mining and resources industry which is so critical to the Western Australian economy.

JOURNALIST:  It's still sub-2 per cent in WA. Are bosses being too greedy?

PRIME MINISTER: We need to see more growth and Western Australia has been coming back from one of the biggest knocks to its economy that they have ever seen in Western Australian history. $80 billion was ripped out of the Australian economy on the down side of the mining investment boom and pretty much the majority of that hit here in Western Australia. So when you come off the back of a mining investment boom here in Western Australia, it hits hard and Western Australia is fighting back, it’s making its way back and we're supporting that by these types of projects. $900 million in investment in sustainment and maintenance for our frigate program. $1.5 billion going into infrastructure to supporting the biggest naval rebuild in Australia's history post-war. We will get back to 2 per cent of the size of the economy by 2021, ahead of the schedule we promised for our defence spending. When we came to office, that was 1.36 per cent, I think it was, the lowest level since before the Second World War. That was Labor's investment in our defence industries. Our investment in our defence industries is creating generational jobs.

JOURNALIST: Nationals MPs are publicly rebuking your Parliamentary tactics on the big stick power legislation. Why won’t you force it to a vote in the final days?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, my priority as we go into the Budget sitting are the Budget and the key Budget bills and appropriation bills and we've got a couple of days there and we'll address those as a priority. Another bill that I know will be very important to North Queensland MPs, and Linda has a close association with her other responsibilities for the North Queensland recovery, is the bill we will have to introduce to deliver that support to livestock industry, particularly cattle station-owners and managers up in North Queensland. They're my priorities going into that sitting - to ensure we're delivering the support for farmers affected by drought. In the last parliamentary sitting, Labor voted against us establishing the National Drought Future Fund. They voted against a drought Future Fund at a time when our farmers need our support, we’re delivering it, Labor voted against that bill. My priority going into that week will be to get the Budget handed down, the first surplus we've seen in 12 years. It's a long way back. You vote Labor once, you pay for it for a decade and that's what the experience has been in getting our Budget back into balance. That's what it has meant in getting our employment as a share of the working age population to its highest level we have seen on economic record. It took us 12 years to get back there after Labor were voted in in 2007. So I'm just saying to Australians the economy you live in for the next decade will be determined by the choices that are made at this election, just like they were back in 2007, and we've been paying for Labor being voted in on that occasion for the past 12 years.

JOURNALIST: Is Australia in a per-capita recession?

PRIME MINISTER: This is not an economic term that any economist has any recognition of so I'm not going to engage in the made-up statistics that the Labor Party are talking about. That's just a straight lie from Labor and you know that. So I'm not going to indulge Labor's posturing on this. These per-capita outcomes we saw under the previous Labor government and under the Howard government on a number of occasions. The real indicators of living standards, as you know, go to the national income per capita and these have been rising, as you know, over the past year and I welcome that. But our economy cannot be taken for granted. More than half the Australians voting at this next election will not have experienced a recession during their working lives. And so I can understand that you need a long memory to understand what it was like to work through that type of an economic period of time. I did. I came out of university back the '90s, in the early '90s, and I went in to that period of time. Friends, others, couldn't get jobs. We had a million people out of work. That's not what I want to see for the future of our country. And our plans here, like what we're seeing with our investments in industry, in infrastructure, in defence, are going to ensure against going back to those terrible times.

JOURNALIST: There’s been an internal brawl here over the Curtin preselection. What do you want to see happen with that?

PRIME MINISTER: The preselectors will gather on Sunday and they’ll make a very good decision.

JOURNALIST: Are you concerned about the internal fighting over that?

PRIME MINISTER: No I don't accept... This is a preselection. There are a number of candidates. They'll stand up on Sunday, preselectors will make a decision and they'll make a good one.

JOURNALIST: Is that tit-for-tat between factional heavyweights in that preselection…?

PRIME MINISTER: I think all of that is very overstated.

JOURNALIST: The Liberal Party was punished in the state election there. What has changed since then and what’s your message to people in Victoria?

PRIME MINISTER: In Victoria?

JOURNALIST: Yeah.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, in Victoria, I'm working closely with the Victorian government to deliver some of the biggest infrastructure projects the state has ever seen. The Tullamarine Rail is going to completely transform the city of Melbourne and we put $5 billion, hard cash, equity, into that investment to transform Melbourne’s infrastructure and the shape of their city into the future. The congestion-busting projects which we've been putting into Victoria, led by Alan Tudge, that is ensuring that the choke points that are frustrating Melburnians so much are being alleviated by the targeted nature of our congestion fund. When it comes to energy, the announcement I made in Tasmania last week about the Marinuslink, that will unlock 400 megawatts of power which is just sitting idle in Tasmania, which will help get electricity prices for people who live in Victoria. I will work closely with Dan Andrews, I’m going to work closely with him to deliver the infrastructure that Victorians need and to deliver the jobs and standard of living that Victorians are looking for and we've got the plans to achieve just that.

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible]

PRIME MINISTER: Sorry. I couldn't hear you.

JOURNALIST: Offers have come through to build two High Efficiency, Low Emissions coal generators in NSW. Will you Government approve or underwrite them?

PRIME MINISTER: They're projects for the New South Wales Government. We don't have any involvement in those.

JOURNALIST: Has the Commonwealth assessed whether those plants stack up commercially?

PRIME MINISTER: They're not projects that relate to us.

JOURNALIST: Will you allow federal taxpayers subsidising of coal-fired power stations?

PRIME MINISTER: Those projects have nothing to do with our Government, we have no involvement with them, and I have no planned involvement with them.

JOURNALIST: Our Premier Mark McGowan yesterday said he’s hoping to ask you for more federal funding for projects like METRONET and regional roads. Do you have any plans to invest...

PRIME MINISTER: Look, I work well with Mark McGowan and just like I do with Dan Andrews. As Prime Minister you work with the Premier who is there and I appreciate the working relationship I've had with Mark McGowan. But, you know, they've got to spend the money we've already sent them. They haven't even been able to spend the money on Metronet that we've committed to them. We have record investment, some $11 billion of commitments to infrastructure here in Western Australia. On this visit I've come with $1.3 billion to honour the GST arrangement I've put in place. Too much money never seems to be enough sometimes with state premiers, but I don't think the Western Australian government in any way, shape or form can say that this Commonwealth Government and myself as Prime Minister and indeed prior as Treasurer, has not gone above and beyond when it comes to the fiscal needs of Western Australia. I delivered on the GST deal. I promised I would. Bill Shorten was all over the place. Western Australians know they can trust me when it comes to supporting Western Australians. Linda?

MINISTER REYNOLDS: Thank you, Prime Minister. Today we've talked a lot about infrastructure and jobs of the future here in Western Australia and I'd say this today to Mark McGowan, to the Premier. Use some of this $1.3 billion the Prime Minister has brought with him today, right here at the Henderson precinct. The Federal Government has committed and is already spending hundreds of millions of dollars of $1.6 billion in this broader precinct. The state government today has spent not a cent. So what I would say to Mark McGowan and to Paul Papalia the state minister, you know what needs to be done here. We’ve reviewed it for the last 12 months, we’ve done a Commonwealth and state review. You know what has to be done, we need roads, rail and infrastructure here. We need new warfage, we need a new channel, we need infrastructure right here. We have companies who want to expand here, we’ve got companies that want to come down here and build multi-generational jobs, but we don’t have the facilities. So Premier McGowan, please use some of this $1.3 billion and start work underway here. The Federal Government has put our money where our mouth is and investing in the area and it’s time now for the state government to do what it knows needs to be done here at Henderson.

JOURNALIST: Have you had any overtures or contact from the Premier since you were elevated to Cabinet on the weekend?

MINISTER REYNOLDS: Not yet, but I work very closely with the Premier and also with Minister Papalia. So we know… we’ve done all the work, we know what needs to be done to grow the jobs and the industries here. He’s just got to put his hand in his pockets and get the work under way.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, as a former tourism boss, Chris Hemsworth and Matt Damon are currently on holiday in Canarvon.

PRIME MINISTER: Great.

JOURNALIST: How much is Tourism Australia paying them to be there and how much…

PRIME MINISTER: Oh look I’d have to refer to the Tourism Minister on that, I’m not close to those arrangements. But what I do know is that Australia has always had the best product to sell to the rest of the world, the greatest experiences, the greatest people, the greatest environment and I’m not surprised that they would be so willing to come and participate. So I think it’s good news for Western Australia, I think it’s good news for Australia and you know, what we’re seeing in tourism jobs, hospitality jobs all around the country is incredibly important to drive our economy forward and you can rely on us to continue to invest in that tourism sector. As you know, I’ve got quite a bit of experience in the tourism sector and I’m always thrilled to see it going ahead in leaps and bounds. Thank you.

BEN FORDHAM: Prime Minister, good afternoon.

PRIME MINISTER: G’day Ben, g’day from Perth.

FORDHAM: Thank you for joining us. You went to Christmas Island yesterday. What did you find?

PRIME MINISTER: Well they've been able to stand up the facility as we asked them to do a couple of weeks ago. That's what was recommended to us after the Labor Party voted to undermine our border protection laws. The Department of Home Affairs said we will now need to set up Christmas Island again. We'd be closed it last year. So it's been stood up. The medical facilities are there. It's ready to receive people who may be transferred under this new scheme. But what it sends a very clear message about is to those who are looking to game this new loophole, well you won't be coming to the mainland - you'll be going to Christmas Island into a very hardened in detention facility.

FORDHAM: What kind of condition is it in, if it hasn't been used for a year? Is it full of cobwebs and mothballs?

PRIME MINISTER: No, no, it was all shut down about October last year and so when they do that and decommission a facility like that, they have a procedure for actually standing it up again. That's what's called a hot contingency, so that means that they can stand it up again pretty quickly, which they've done. And those services are there and you know there's the education books coming back out in the adjacent rooms and the other facilities are put in place. So it's ready to receive. But my hope is that the way we've dealt with this and firmed up our border protection regime to cater for when Bill Shorten sought to weaken, that hopefully it won't get that much that much use.

FORDHAM: So you’re not expecting boats?

PRIME MINISTER: Well not under us, no. I think our border protection regime, I think people smugglers know that when they come up against me they've got a brick wall. If they come up against Bill Shorten, there's an open door. And so the one thing standing I think between those boats and Australia is our Government You know you never give an absolute guarantee on that because as you know there's you know 10,000 people plus up in Indonesia alone who would get on a boat tomorrow if they thought they could get through. But they know we will turn them back, they know we will send them to Nauru but they don't know that about Bill Shorten because he's had umpteen different positions on this and is led around the nose by Tanya Plibersek on border protection.

FORDHAM: The Medivac thing is now reality, right? So are you thinking that there are going to be boats coming and is there any suggestion that we've seen any leave?

PRIME MINISTER: Well what we're seeing is that people know that we're still the Government and that they know I’ll turn boats back. That's what they're certain of. They know that the border protection regime was weakened by the Labor Party and the law. But they also know that I took immediate action to compensate for that by strengthening what we're doing with Operation Sovereign Borders but also you know that they know if you're sitting on Manus Island now then you're not getting to go to Bondi for treatment. You've got to go to Christmas Island and be in a detention facility. That's where you'll receive your treatment.

FORDHAM: So Christmas Island yesterday, in WA today what do what are you up to? Are you on the election campaign trail already?

PRIME MINISTER: Well for the last six months, Ben, since I've taken over as Prime Minister, it's been my task really to get out to Australians all over the country and explain what we're doing as a Government, where we're going to take Australia after the next election if we're successful. This morning I was down at the Henderson wharf facility where we're actually doing all the maintenance on all the frigates. That's a huge project for Western Australia, it's a $900 billion contract to maintain and upgrade those frigates. We're building the offshore patrol vessels, the Pacific patrol boats over here as well. Investing in those defence contracts is actually very important for our economy. We're hitting some headwinds in our economy and so using our defence procurement as a way of actually supporting jobs and industry, not just in Western Australia but right across the country.

FORDHAM: We had a hint of those headwinds yesterday. Were you worried about those economic figures out yesterday? They were indicating if it wasn't for population growth we'd be in recession. Are you still confident about getting back into surplus?

PRIME MINISTER: Well no that's not quite what it said, to be honest. I mean, the Labor Party came up with some new language on these things which was to spin, but the economy is still growing at 2.3 per cent. The economy is growing. That's what it is doing. And I wasn't surprised to see that yesterday because as I've been warning now for some period of time what we're seeing overseas, the softening in global market conditions, then they're not things Australia has control over but they'll have an impact here. So my very simple point is now is not the time - in fact never is the time in my view - but you don't go and deal with a soft global economy by putting $200 billion of higher taxes on your economy, including a $5 billion dollar a year tax on retirees, abolishing negative gearing as we know it, putting up capital gains tax and halving the income tax cuts that we've already legislated for Australians right across right across the spectrum. I mean, that's not how you actually put your economy into a more resilient position. That's what the Labor Party wants to do and I think it will be very, very damaging for our economy if they are allowed to do that.

FORDHAM: When I mentioned that about, you know, if it wasn't for population growth we'd be in recession. I spoke to Terry McCrann yesterday, the business writer from NewsCorp. He almost dropped a swear word, Prime Minister, when he was on the show accidentally. He said, “We are high on the speed of immigration but if you take immigration out of the mix the economy is in deep shhhhh.” And then I had to jump in and save him. So do you disagree with that analysis from Terry McCrann?

PRIME MINISTER: Income per capita, disposable income per capita, these measures show that positive position over the last 12 months and that's been an improvement. Non mining investment also grew yesterday. I mean, what we've seen on business investment is the mining sector continued to lag on investment and that has not been helping the economy go forward. What's been making up for that is the big investments we've been making them in services and infrastructure. That's been important because when you have $80 billion of mining investment stripped out of the economy coming on the downside of the mining investment boom then that's going to have an impact. And that's why we’ve been doing what we're doing in defence industry, infrastructure and other things to ensure that the economy is continued to grow and that's why we've been able to retain our Triple A credit rating. But the great risk of Labor is that they go and get rid of negative gearing as we know it and put up capital gains tax by 50 per cent on these assets. What that will simply do was usher in a hard landing in our housing market and it's already soft now. You go and do that and you only worsen the situation and we all know what that will mean for the economy. So look, I think Terry is right to highlight that there are some real vulnerabilities and risks. And that's why you need to be doing things that are sensible in your economy, investing in the infrastructure and not dampening the economy through higher taxes.

FORDHAM: I know you're tight on time so let me squeeze in a few more and I thank you very much for calling in by the way, we appreciate it. Bill Shorten says the next election will be a referendum on wages and we know wages are too low, they haven't budged in years. I'm guessing you don't have the power to wave the magic wand and guarantee workers a pay rise?

PRIME MINISTER: Well that's why you need your economy to be strong and the only people are going to get a wage rise under Bill Shorten are the people smugglers. That's who is going to get a wage rise under him. As a result of his policies, because he's an open door when it comes to those issues. But I mean, people in the construction industry aren't going to have wage rises under Bill Shorten, he's going to shut the industry down through what he's doing on negative gearing. People who work in the mining industry aren't going to have that because his Cabinet would be quite happy and would think it was wonderful that our mining industry was having problems. He's not standing with them. So I don't know which workers he is actually standing up for. But under our policies the economy will be in a much better shape than it would under Labor, which means you've got a better chance for a wage rise. And on his emissions reduction target of 45 per cent - 45 per cent - versus ours of 26. That means they have to find three times the amount of emissions and that will mean a 9,000 cut to wages over the next 10 years in 2030, by following that policy.

FORDHAM: Let me ask you about the reports out today about this Chinese company that is backed by the Chinese government wanting to build a massive new coal fired power plant in the Hunter Valley. One of your MPs Craig Kelly says it's fantastic. Now, I gather this is a matter for the New South Wales Government but as Prime Minister of Australia, do you have a problem with a Chinese-owned company owning a key part of our power supply?

PRIME MINISTER: Well there are Chinese companies that already do own parts of coal mining operations in New South Wales currently and otherwise those operations probably wouldn’t even be there, which is no good for those who work in those places. But that particular project, there is no federal involvement in that. It would have to follow the normal further approval processes, I imagine. But that’s a matter for the state government, we’re not involved in that.

FORDHAM: OK quick one, as a rugby league fan, what do you make of the NRL players involved in leaked videos in these sex tapes? I know that Phil Gould from the Penrith Panthers says this goes beyond sport, it’s a massive issue for Australians mums and dads. What’s your message to younger people who are facing these issues, that… well, they can basically ruin lives in an instant and we’re seeing that at the moment. What’s your message?

PRIME MINISTER: I just think this is just appalling. I mean, as a fan of the game, as fans, that’s who I identify with. I love going along to the game but I mean, this week I announced $328 million to support programs to prevent violence against women and people have got to lift their act. They’ve got to lift their game.

FORDHAM: We appreciate you calling in, when are you heading back our way?

PRIME MINISTER: I’ll be back there on the weekend and I’ll be back there to be with Gladys at the election campaign launch on the weekend. I was with her on Monday when we announced the Western Sydney International Nancy-Bird Walton Airport which was very exciting. I know many of your listeners would now be able to drive past out there on Elizabeth Drive and see the wonderful picture there of Nancy-Bird. To have one of our airports in Sydney named after our greatest male aviation pioneer and to have Nancy-Bird Walton which was one of his first, I think his first student, and the first women in the Commonwealth, not just Australia, to get a commercial pilots licence. That’s a great tribute to women, I think, in Australia and New South Wales in particular.

FORDHAM: No doubt about it. On a lighter note before I let you go, Ray Williams who is a Minister here in NSW, we have named and shamed him today for using photos on his election posters from about 30 years ago when he had jet black hair. Are we going to see current photos of Scott Morrison on his election posters or old ones?

PRIME MINISTER: No, no you will see current ones.

FORDHAM: With photoshopped shoes or real shoes?

PRIME MINISTER: No, the Prime Minister and Cabinet Department won’t be responsible for that so we’ll make sure my real shoes are in the photo, no problem. And you’ll have to see me all in my white-haired glory.

FORDHAM: I’ll be watching, thanks very much.

GARETH PARKER: On the line is the Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Good morning.

PRIME MINISTER: G’day Gareth, it's great to be here the west.

PARKER: Appreciate your time. You’re here in Perth, we will come to that. You worried about the economy though?

PRIME MINISTER: I've been saying for some time that these headwinds we're seeing around the world, whether it's the China-US trade issues, strategic sort of tensions. What's happening with Brexit. Europe. I mean, there is some real headwinds in the economy at the moment. And we're faring better than pretty much all of the G7 economies except for the United States at the moment and that's why it’s important we keep doubling down on supporting small businesses, reducing taxes and the investments where I've just come from out in Henderson here in Western Australia. I mean, $900 million dollars in sustainment maintenance activities, $1.5 billion going into the infrastructure to support the patrol boats. So these are the things that will keep that economy moving.

PARKER: OK. But I guess in a way that's sort of the point. What the national accounts revealed yesterday is that the only thing that's really propping up the economy is government spending, the private part of the economy is really, really weak.

PRIME MINISTER: Well that's… the non-mining investment was actually up, mining investment was down. When you put the two together the combined impact of mining investment with the others showed that reducing, but non-mining investment actually improved and that's to be, I think, that's to be importantly noted. But that's why it's important that the mining sector and the resource sector are to be supported and appreciated. I mean, the Labor Party actually are welcoming the fact that the mining industry is facing some difficult times with global markets. I mean they described it as wonderful. I mean that's just nuts.

PARKER: OK. But households at the moment are nervous. I mean, you know how it works. In this state we've been struggling with house prices and the consumer economy has been really weak for years. But we're starting to see this hit Sydney and Melbourne as well, which given their importance to the national economy, is a pretty big problem I think.

PRIME MINISTER: Well that's why you wouldn't go and put $200 billion of extra taxes on the economy. That's why you wouldn't abolish negative gearing and put up capital gains tax, it's why you wouldn't go and slug retirees $5 billion a year, 85,000 Western Australians to strip their franked different dividends away from them with their with their credits. That would be a recipe for real damage to our Australian economy and that's what Bill Shorten is proposing. I'm not going to do any of those things, I'm actually cutting taxes.

PARKER: OK. What's on the agenda here in Perth? You’ve been in Henderson this morning what else we up to?

PRIME MINISTER: This afternoon I will be up in the electorate of Cowan, we’ve got a meeting there with a lot of the multicultural communities that are there and I'm looking forward to sitting down with them. I'll be with Christian Porter later today. We're also making some... doing some further work on some of the domestic violence issues and following up some of the funding we announced earlier this week. So it's you know it's an important visit but where I was this morning was very important. I mean that is a huge investment we're making in the defence industry here and the supply chain impacts of that investment right across hundreds and hundreds of companies. You know, it's a huge industry and we're talking about generational jobs. I mean, I met people there this morning who'd been there for 32 years there. Their son works there and I suspect grandsons will work there eventually. There's just intergenerational jobs we're creating out there at Henderson

PARKER:  You can't afford to lose any seats in WA, can you? But the Labor Party is coming for them.

PRIME MINISTER: Well I can't afford to lose any seats anywhere in the country. And this is why our plan for a stronger economy, keeping our national security strength in place, and that is particularly the case in terms of border protection. I mean, Bill Shorten has been caught out. As I said yesterday, when people smugglers see me they see a brick wall. When they see Bill Shorten, they see an open door and you can see that in terms of his reaction to the issues on Christmas Island where I was yesterday.

PARKER: We’ll come back on Christmas Island, but I just I just want to focus on Perth for the moment. I mean it's... you're right. You can't afford to lose any seats, but here in the West, what's happened in previous election campaigns is the WA Liberal Party's been really strong particularly with money. My mail, and it's widely accepted, is that the WA Liberal Party at the moment is on the bones of its bum financially. You doing any fundraisers while you're here as well?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I always am and they're always very well attended. I don’t know where you're getting your intel from but I know in terms of the federal election it's far stronger than it was going into the last federal election.

PARKER: You’re not going to have Malcolm Turnbull's $1.5 billion to fall back on, are you?

PRIME MINISTER: Well no, we have actually got a lot more than that, that has come from support from businesses and individuals all across the country who understand what $200 billion of higher taxes will mean for the economy. How it will be a sheet anchor that will hold back jobs, it will hold back wages, it will hold back the growth in the business community that we need to support all of those economic outcomes. But it goes further that. If you don't have a strong economy, then you can't meet your commitments when it comes to health and education and affordable medicines, all things we've done under our Government. Bulk billing is at record levels. Record levels.

PARKER: The Christmas Island visit, was that a legitimate need for the Prime Minister to go there? No Prime Minister has been there before. Or was it just a political stunt so you could whack Bill Shorten over the head with the issue?

PRIME MINISTER: Well Tanya Plibersek said this week that the Prime Minister has to explain to the Australian people how the facilities on Christmas Island are going to meet the need for what is now before us. That's exactly what I did yesterday. I mean, the Labor Party can't have it both ways. They can't say I need to explain to the Australian people, and when I go and do it and demonstrate it and show them how it's going to work, then they complain the other way. I'll tell you why the Labor Party doesn't want to talk about Christmas Island ever, because it is the scene of Australia's greatest ever policy failure that happened on their watch. They want to pretend like Christmas Island never existed in the Labor Party. The riots, the fires, the tragedies. Four and five boats turning up every single day. That's what happened at Christmas Island. And Labor wants to pretend like it never happened. So when I make this very clear point that I am now having to reopen the Christmas Island detention facility that I closed last year because of Labor weakening our border protection laws in the Parliament under the Shorten's law. Well, the Labor Party doesn't like it but the Australian public deserve to know.

PARKER: The warning was that when the Medivac Bill passed there'd be hundreds of applications immediately. How many applications have there been?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it's the law has only just come into place in the last couple of days.

PARKER: But the suggestion was our ready to go. So how many applications have been made?

PRIME MINISTER: What we're seeing is the asylum advocates and others are putting their plans together putting their talking points together.

PARKER: Has there been any applications made?

PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to give you a running commentary.

PARKER: But have there been any applications made?

PRIME MINISTER: Gareth let me make this point. The reason we have reopened Christmas Island and this is working, is to ensure that those who thought they could game the system and find their way to Perth or Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane - no, you'll be going to Christmas Island. You'll be in a hardened detention facility. And that was the advice that was given to us by Home Affairs that we needed that facility particularly. I mean, we've got people...

PARKER: I can understand that there's probably some pretty significant deterrent effect there by saying you're not coming to the mainland, you’re going to Christmas Island but I'm just wondering, because the advice was that saying that the applications were ready to go. I'm just wondering have there been any yet? It sounds like they haven't.

PRIME MINISTER: There will be applications, I have no doubt about it, and the asylum groups are doing what they always do and that is seeking to undermine the Government's policies. But the reason we had that advice from Home Affairs is we had to remove any incentive effect for those who were looking to game the system like always happens and it strikes me that our reaction, by reopening Christmas Island, is having the desired effect and in the same way it's having the effect of deterring boats from coming to Australia. It’s my job, I don't want to see too many people transferred by gaming the system at all. So you know, if there turns out to be fewer applications, it'll be because the Government got the response right. Bill Shorten weakened the laws, I strengthen the system.

PARKER: Could Julie Bishop have beaten Bill Shorten if she was PM?

PRIME MINISTER: It's a moot point.

PARKER: It is a moot point I agree. But I'm just interested. What do you think?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I don't offer opinions on this, it's my job to beat it and that's what I'm doing and that's what the party elected me to do.

PARKER: Does it help you beat him for her to say that only she could beaten him?

PRIME MINISTER: No it's for you guys to talk about. I don't really engage in that stuff, other than to thank Julie for the tremendous service to Western Australia, a tremendous service to the Parliament. I've worked alongside Julie for many years in the Cabinet and I thank her for her patriotic service to our country and our Party.

PARKER: You interested in helping the WACA fund their redevelopment ambitions?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it's with Mark McGowan. They're the ones doing the assessment. I brought a cheque with $1.3 billion effectively with me because of what I'm honouring the GST deal, which is you know we had to legislate. I designed it, we legislated and that means they'll get, Western Australia will get, $1.3 billion extra than they would have otherwise got. So I think West Australians know that they can trust me when it comes to my commitments and I've made them. I would just... it's up to the state government how they spend that money. But $1.3 billion I think gives them a lot more room to move than they've had otherwise to do whatever they consider to be the priorities and if they consider that a priority, well that's a matter for them.

PARKER: So sounds like you're not that keen.

PRIME MINISTER: Well it's a Western Australian state government issue, it's not it's not necessarily a Federal Government issue. They're assessing the project at the moment, not the Commonwealth Government, and they have $1.3 billion dollars that they wouldn't otherwise have had if it were not for my Government.

PARKER: OK. Christian Porter just told us earlier that he's been lobbying hard on this one.

PRIME MINISTER: Lots of members lobby about lots of things.

PARKER: OK, we'll have to wait and see then. Scott Morrison, I appreciate your time. Thank you.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks a lot. Good to be here and thanks for having me on.


Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the North West Point Detention Centre on Christmas Island, Wednesday, March 6, 2019.
DOORSTOP, CHRISTMAS ISLAND

PRIME MINISTER: ... had Christmas Island just over that, in fact. I was the Immigration Minister at the time. At that period of time we were about to embark on our Operation Sovereign Borders turn back policy. This centre had quite a lot of people in it at that time. When I left the role as Immigration Minister there were no more children here in this facility. As Prime Minister, I was pleased that last year we were able to close this facility. As Prime Minister just a few weeks ago, I was pleased to be able to say that the last of the children who were on Nauru had left. It isn't a good thing that we are now in the position, as a result of what the Labor Party has done and the vote they put into the Parliament, that we are now required to reopen this facility. We are required to do that. That was the clear advice of the Department of Home Affairs in response to the Bill that was passed through the parliament, cheered on by the Labor Party and Bill Shorten. I particularly want to commend and thank Border Force, Serco, IHMS and all others who have been part of restanding up this facility in short order. When we took the decision, straight after the vote in the Parliament, when I convened the National Security Committee, that was the standing advice, it was reconfirmed to us and we took the decision to do that. They got to work here and as you can see, this facility stands ready to deal with any of the transfers that would need to take place.

I have seen this facility in many different forms. I was here in… after 2011 when rioting detainees burned the place down. There have been many protests here. There have been many challenging times here. But I want to commend all of those who have worked in this facility and they have learned how to run an outstanding centre and to do it with the care and the support, as well as the strength that is needed to ensure an orderly detention process. Now, the decision we have taken is that for those who would be transferred to Australia as a result of the passing of the legislation in the Parliament, this is where they will come. They are single males - overwhelmingly - and only single males will be transferred to this facility, and in particular those who would under no circumstances previously until this Bill was passed, would they be transferred. Those, there are some very serious cases in which the Minister can speak to, they would be detained here in the highest security of the facilities you have here. This facility can take up to almost 600 transferees. At present they can take 250 and that will be ramping up very quickly. The medical facilities, which you have seen here, are also being ramped up in terms of additional medical professionals who will be here to provide what support is necessary and that will be done in response to demand that is observed.

But let me be clear about why we’ve reopened Christmas Island. First of all, it is to deal with the transfer of people who have been found to be compliant with the legislation that was passed through the Parliament. Those transferees who are coming under that process will find themselves here. The construction camp and Phosphate Hill facilities will be available to support any females who might be subject to that process. The other thing that Christmas Island does is that in the event that if there were to be a resurgence in illegal boat activity, this is the transfer point. This is where the boats would come, those who would seek to illegally enter Australia, they would be quickly processed here and they would be transferred to Nauru. So there is no change to any of those arrangements. Anyone who is thinking of coming to Australia illegally by boat, understand that our border protection regime is in place. We have strengthened it after the efforts of the Parliament to weaken it, by the Labor Party, and we will be ensuring, with the increased support into Operation Sovereign Borders, that if you seek to come to Australia illegally by boat we will turn the boat back and we will transfer you to Nauru if you sought to come that way and nothing on that score has changed. But this facility has been stood up to ensure that we can meet the demand that would come from the passing of that legislation and transfers that would come from Nauru to here and from Manus Island to here.

So I just want to be very clear about what the purpose is here. This facility under Labor got to a point where more than 3,000 people were on this island. That's how bad it can get when Labor runs the borders. I think it is important that we reflect on that when we stand here on Christmas Island. This centre was closed under our Government and it reached well above its capacity under the Labor Government. That is a clear contrast, I think, for Australians to observe. Again, I want to thank those who have been involved in standing up this facility. I thought it was important for me personally to come here and see that the facility was ready and so it can respond to the demand that we would expect. My objective is to ensure that no boats come and we have taken actions to ensure that that occurs, that no boats come. But also any of those who would seek to try and game this arrangement that has been put in place by the Australian Parliament with Labor's cheering it on, well, you won't be coming to the mainland of Australia, you'll be coming here. Anyone who wants to game the system, understand you won't be able to game your way to the mainland if I have anything to do with it. This is why we are here. I want to ask Minister David Coleman, I want to thank him for his incredible work to get us standing up here so quickly, David, to make a few comments. Then we will hear from the Border Force Commissioner and the Commander of Operation Sovereign Borders.

THE HON DAVID COLEMAN MP, MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION: Thanks PM. So, in July 2013 there were 3,200 people on Christmas Island and that included more than 600 children. More than 600 children were placed in detention here on Christmas Island in July 2013. When we came to office, there were 2,000 children in detention in Australia. They were all removed from detention by our Government. There has not been one child on Manus Island for years and there are no children on Nauru. So we have cleaned up the extraordinary mess that Labor left behind. The population of people in detention under this Government is 90 per cent less - 90 per cent less - than it was under Labor and we have closed 19 detention centres. The population on Manus and Nauru, as I said, there are no children, 96 per cent of the people on those islands are adult males and there is a small number of women remaining on those islands.

So we now have to respond to Labor's law and it's upending of the successful system of offshore processing and one of the things that we have to respond to is the fact that under Labor's law, there is a very limited capacity for the Government to stop someone from entering Australia on character grounds. There are only two - a breach of the ASIO Act and someone who has been to jail for 12 months or more. Now, there are dozens of people for whom we have been - the Government has been advised - are not captured by either of those elements of Labor's law but nonetheless have serious character concerns. And under Labor's law we will be required, should those people present and pass the assessment or treatment test under the law to bring those people to Australia. Those people include people who have posted extremist imagery online. They include people with allegations of sexual assault, including allegations of sexual assault against children. And they include people whose online behaviour raises very serious concerns of their potential links to banned organisations. So there are a serious number of people who are… we have grave concerns about under this law and the use of Christmas Island and parts of Christmas Island will be an important component in ensuring that should those people come to Australia they are in a secure facility.

I'd also, along with the PM like to thank the staff, the Border Force staff, Home Affairs staff and many others who have contributed to the rapid stand up of this facility and thank them for all of their efforts.

MICHAEL OUTRAM APM, BORDER FORCE COMMISSIONER: Thank you Prime Minister, thank you Minister. Good morning everybody. A little bit over two weeks ago, this facility was essentially in mothballs. The fact that today it stands ready in terms of us garrison support, the security facilities, the medical facilities, the facilities management, is a testament to some tremendous work. Not only by our Border Force officers, and I’d like to thank Superintendent Jenny Green and here team here and her colleagues back in Canberra, but it is a whole of Government team effort. Colleagues in the Department of Home Affairs working with our contractors Serco and IHMS in particular. So my thanks goes to all of those people because you can see today, it is a world class facility now. We are ready to take any number of people who come this way and it is ready to take on operations. So thank you to all those people, great job. Prime Minister.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you, Commissioner. Commander Furini?

MAJOR GENERAL CRAIG FURINI CSC, COMMANDER OF OPERATION SOVEREIGN BORDERS: Thank you Prime Minister and good morning. Notwithstanding the excellent preparations that have been done here, I would like to reiterate the points from the Prime Minister that Operation Sovereign Borders has fundamentally not changed. My mission remains to protect Australia's border from the threat of illegal maritime arrivals and prevent the needless loss of life at sea. To effect that mission, I have been reinforced in using my multi-layered approach. I will continue to deter, disrupt and interdict people smuggling efforts and where necessary return people and to pick up on a point if people can't be returned, they will not be coming here to Christmas Island to stay, they will be moving off to regional processing in Nauru. Thank you, Prime Minister.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks Commander. Happy to take some questions. Jenny is also here to take any particular questions on the details of the stand-up.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you expect all 940 people still on Manus and Nauru to want to get treatment in Australia?

PRIME MINISTER: We will see. We are ready to respond to that type of demand but I think those who thought that this would be some easy passage to the mainland and would seek to try and take advantage and game the system, well, I think they are getting a very clear message that it won't be as simple as that. They will come here to Christmas Island and this is where they will receive that assessment. In the normal cases where people are requiring significant health treatment, I mean, those cases were already dealt with under the previous arrangements where people needed that care. They were getting that care.

JOURNALIST: So they will go back to, say, the Mater hospital in Brisbane?

PRIME MINISTER: That depends. It is a case by case assessment by the medical teams which has been for years. There is no change to those arrangements. The real risk here is the loopholes that have been opened up by the Labor Party in changing the laws means that there will be plenty who want to game the system, just as they sought to game the system to try and illegally enter Australia in the first place. So they have form. This hardened facility here will be able to deal with them. This is a place where their procedures I think have firmed incredibly over the years, having dealt with some real significant challenges. And let’s not forget that those on Manus have participated in riots before in those places. So this facility will be able to deal with it and they have the systems and the people in place to be able to deal any threats should they arise.

JOURNALIST: You have said before this is all about messaging when it comes to people smuggling trade. What kind of message do you think it is sending today to people smugglers to have you here, the first Prime Minister visiting Christmas Island, because there are going to many people criticising you for effectively advertising that Christmas Island is back open and that in fact you’re almost daring people smugglers to restart their trade?

PRIME MINISTER: Any time that people smugglers see me they see a brick wall to them coming and plying their trade in Australia. Any time they see Bill Shorten they see an open door. That is what my record demonstrates and that’s what Bill Shorten's record demonstrates. Bill Shorten was part of a Government that sent 3,000 people here. Bill Shorten was part of a Government that allows 820 boats to bring 50,000 people to Australia and see 1,200 people die. My record in this place is I shut it down, I got every single child off this island. That is my record. When people smugglers see me, they see a brick wall.

JOURNALIST: Has Home Affairs actually received any doctor endorsed applications for transfer here?

PRIME MINISTER: It has only been a couple of days since the laws have been stood up. So we’ll deal with those in course. The doctors panel is still being formed. David might want to respond to that. So we will deal with demand as it presents but I don't intend to provide a running commentary on that. My intention here is to ensure that vexatious acts by those who would seek to game the system to come to Australia using these loopholes will think twice about it. I mean, if we see less than otherwise we might have expected, I think that will be as a result of the actions the Government has taken to thwart and not provide incentives to that sort of vexatious behaviour.

JOURNALIST: Can I just ask a question about the list of 57 detainees that the Government has concerns about? Does that mean that the other 900 detainees you are not concerned about, and that any application by them would proceed on the basis that they are legitimately seeking asylum and they are of good character?

THE HON DAVID COLEMAN MP, MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION: There are 57 people who, as I said, under Labor's law, the Government would be required to bring to Australia and for whom we have very serious character concerns. People who have posted radical extremist material online. People who have been accused of sexual assault, including against children. So we are very, very concerned about those people.

JOURNALIST: I understand, and you’ve detailed their particular circumstance, we understand. But is it fair to group them in with all asylum seekers? It would seem if you looked at 950 of them, you have concerns about the vast majority would be of good character.

THE HON DAVID COLEMAN MP, MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION:  We have clearly highlighted the 57 who are of greatest concern. And there are some very significant concerns about that group.

PRIME MINISTER: But of the other group, I would say this, they sought to illegally enter Australia, they sought to come to Australia by the wrong means. We have one of the most reputable and credible refugee and humanitarian programs of any country in the world and we take 18,250 people through the front door every year. But if you want to come by some other way, the policy of the Government is you don't get to resettle in Australia. So if they want to seek to use Labor's law, which sought to weaken regional processing - indeed end it as we know it - then what I am saying is we will be putting those obstacles in the way as you would expect me to do and the Australian people would expect me to do. I am serious when it comes to integrity of our border protection regime. I think Australians understand that. I know why we are reopening Christmas Island. Bill Shorten has had a different position on Christmas Island almost every single day. How would he have a position because he has never been here?

JOURNALIST: He says it is a waste of money coming here today. Can you tell us how much it has cost to reopen this centre?

PRIME MINISTER: That will be made available through the normal process. I don't have those figures at hand.

JOURNALIST: It’s not important to you, knowing how much you’re spending on that?

PRIME MINISTER: It is going to be $1.4 billion was the estimate over the four years to actually stand up this facility and run it and expect a high rate of occupancy over four years. And it’s be half a billion over the next two years. So they were the decisions that the Cabinet made based on the information that was provided to us. I wish we didn't have to do that. The reason we are doing this is because Bill Shorten went into the Parliament and he weakened our border protection laws. He was warned. He was warned clearly that this would have to be done in the event that he supported those laws. He chose to vote for it in the Parliament. He has basically voted for this centre to be reopened. He can't walk away from the consequences of that. If he thought the Government wasn't going to take its border protection responsibilities seriously when he wasn’t going to do that, then he is sadly mistaken.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you’ve come here today with the media in tow. This is an area where we have previously been banned from filming, never before have we been beyond the barbed wire so to speak, why now? Why are you inviting the media here today?

PRIME MINISTER: What we have showed you today is what is here at this facility. There are no transferees at this facility today. That is one of the reasons why previously, I understand both under the previous government and ours, that has been one of the reasons why there hasn't been open filming of detention facilities anywhere in the country. There are no transfer here today. So that’s the first point I’d make. The second one is you have seen very clearly the standard of facilities that are here to support people in terms of medical assessment and treatment. This will be ramped up in response to demand and most of that ramping up will occur for people with mental health medical professional experience and those treatments and those support assessments are done at several locations here on the island. There are not only facilities here but the facilities at Phosphate Hill and elsewhere on the island as well as a lot of that assessment and support is being provided in the facility itself.

So the suggestion that this facility is not up to this job, I thought it was important for Australians to know that it is up to this job. That the medical support that is necessary to do the job that is being required of this facility will be able to be delivered through the very professional staff of IHMS who are also operating in Nauru as well and will have a lot of familiarity with many of the cases. This is why we are here today, to show very clearly that my Government is responding to the threat that has been posed by Labor passing that Bill. We are doing it in two ways - ensuring that the boats don't come and ensuring that those who might want to take advantage of this new law to find another back doorway to get into Australia onto the mainland, that they won't have that opportunity.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, it has been some weeks now since the Medivac law passed Parliament, with all of the attending fuss and effective advertising of Australia's change of laws took place, what evidence have you or your agency seen in the weeks since that that has had any impact on the demand for asylum seekers to actually get on the boats and come to our country, and if you haven't mightn’t we be actually standing in the middle of a giant white elephant?

PRIME MINISTER: It’s funny you say that Tim. The Labor Party said, back before 2007 when this facility was built by John Howard, that it would be a white elephant. That is what the Labor Party said. And then they sent over 50,000 people here when they got into Government after 2007.

JOURNALIST: It’s 2019 Prime Minister.

PRIME MINISTER: My point is this, Tim. People have said before when we have raised these points and the Liberal and National Parties, oh no that’ll never happen, this will never happen, the Labor that will never happen under them, that's exactly what happened in 2007. And the same criticisms were made of the Government for putting these out, for putting these facilities in place and the Labor Party used them beyond their capacity because of their weakness on the borders. Now my hope Tim, my hope, and this would certainly be the case should we continue in our roles and be re-elected at the next election, that the need for this facility would subside again. Because if re-elected, I will get rid of those laws and I will make sure that we preserve the situation.

JOURNALIST: Any boat movements, Prime Minister?

PRIME MINISTER: What I do know is this, they are continuing not to come because they know I am still the Prime Minister, Peter Dutton is still the Home Affairs Minister, Operation Sovereign Borders is still in place. That’s what I know for a fact, Tim. What they are waiting for is for Bill Shorten to be Prime Minister.

JOURNALIST: You cited the Department of Home Affairs advice as the requirement to reopen Christmas Island.

PRIME MINISTER: We agreed with their advice, yes.

JOURNALIST: What reasons did they give for that and what reasons did they give for not detaining people in [inaudible] or any other immigration detention centres?

PRIME MINISTER: I set those out at the start of the press conference. I set those out. The purposes are twofold. The first of those is to ensure that we can bring people to a hardened facility because the laws, as they have been passed, deny us the opportunity to prevent people coming from Australia who otherwise would never be able to come and in addition to that, to ensure that those who might seek, frankly, to game the system, those who might seek to take advantage of these laws and seek to come to Australia by that method, that the alternative and the option that the Government would be using here at Christmas Island would not provide an incentive for them to do that. Now thirdly, on top of that, in the event that there were to be vessels coming again, then this facility obviously would have to be used for the transition purposes that the Commander set out which would see people transition through here and be sent directly to Nauru. That would be its purpose.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you take responsibility for the fact that the economy is now deep in a per capita recession?

PRIME MINISTER: I have been warning since last year, I was warning as Treasurer. What you have just set out, that is not how those matters are assessed. That's not how those economic circumstances are described. What I do know is that living standards as measured through the national accounts has actually continued to grow. What I do know is that the Australian economy does face real challenges globally and the Treasurer has been setting them out. I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition, that Bill Shorten is talking a lot about wages. I will tell you this - the only wages that will go up under Bill Shorten's Prime Ministership will be the wages of the people smugglers.

JOURNALIST: The classified leak today is saying that cuts to Australian Border Force are affecting our ability to protect our borders?

MICHAEL OUTRAM APM, BORDER FORCE COMMISSIONER: I will respond to that. So there have been no budget cuts. In fact, patrol days that we spent at sea since 2014 have increased every financial year since 2014. This year what we have received is an additional $74 million in funding as well, which allows us to not only maintain our presence on the water but also be ready to increase that posture in the coming period ahead. The other thing I would say is that Maritime Border Command that sits within the Australian Border Force as a joint agency task force, headed up by a Rear Admiral from the Royal Australian Navy, that task force deploys vessels on the water, yes, and there are a combination of border force and defence vessels. Not only that, we have a range of aircraft of course surveying the water and we have a range of satellites and other capabilities. So this really is about a security in depth principal and we work very collaboratively with a range of agencies to deliver the effects. The key point I would make is that our maritime posture and our border protection capabilities have not been weakened and nor will they be.

JOURNALIST: According to this leaked briefing, the Defence Force is having to pick up the slack and you are running 20 per cent below your targets on sea patrols. Is that accurate and if that is not because of budget cuts, why is it?

MICHAEL OUTRAM APM, BORDER FORCE COMMISSIONER: I’m just going to answer the question, I’m not going to talk any leaked documents. I haven’t seen leaked documents and I don’t know about the providence of leaked documents. What I will say is this, as I have just repeated, our budget has not been cut. We have received an additional $74 million this year in relation to our on-water operations. Maritime border command also provides aerial and satellite surveillance over and above what we put on the water. And so we are very well postured.

JOURNALIST: You are 20 per cent below your patrol targets though?

MICHAEL OUTRAM APM, BORDER FORCE COMMISSIONER: No, I don't believe that is true. But I haven't seen the document you are referring to, I’m afraid.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, your thoughts on publicly-funded abortion?

PRIME MINISTER: This is a very controversial and sensitive issue and on these matters I have never sought to divide Australians on this. I'm a bit disappointed that it is being raised in the eve of election in a very politically charged context. These are matters that are dealt with by the states and territories. I have no desire to overstep what the constitutional authorities are of the Commonwealth in these matters. They are rightly dealt with by the states and the territories. I don't find that debate one that tends to unite Australians and I certainly am not going to engage in the political elements of that discussion because frankly, I don't think it is good for our country. Thanks very much.

JOURNALIST: The leaked defence briefing, it’s appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, will that be referred to the AFP?

PRIME MINISTER: The Commissioner has already, I think, has already put what has been suggested is in that document, he has addressed those issues that are raised in that document and I'm sure that any issues that arise from that from the nature of this document, which I haven’t seen either, will be dealt with in the normal way.

JOURNALIST: One for the Commissioner sorry if you wouldn’t mind. So just to be clear, the assessment that we have seen that is unclassified with the 57 detainees, have you carried out the same assessment on every detainee on Manus and Nauru? Because we have only seen details of about 25.

MICHAEL OUTRAM APM, BORDER FORCE COMMISSIONER: What I will say is the assessments have been undertaken by the intelligence area within the Department of Home Affairs, not by the Australian Border Force.

PRIME MINISTER: It’s not an ADF role. Thanks, everyone.


 
Australian Minister for Women Kelly O'Dwyer, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Australian Social Services Minister Paul Fletcher speak to the media during a press conference in Canberra, Tuesday, March 5, 2019
PRESS CONFERENCE, CANBERRA ACT

PRIME MINISTER: Well I’m pleased to be joined here today by the Minister for Women, Kelly O’Dwyer, the Minister for Social Services, Paul Fletcher. I’m also very pleased to be joined here by Patty Kinnersley, CEO of Our Watch and Libby Lloyd, who presented to our COAG summit delegates back in December. As you know, this entire program around the National Action Plan has been worked in partnership with the states and territories. And I've got to say, Libby's presentation to all of the first ministers in Adelaide was very powerful, very sobering. And has sat, I think, behind a great deal of the thinking as we've gone into preparing this package that I'm announcing today.

Violence against women and children is just simply unacceptable. For many of us, it's just simply unthinkable. And the reality, though, is it occurs, and it occurs all over the country. No community is exempt. It just doesn't happen in disadvantaged communities, it happens in some of the most affluent communities in the country. It just doesn't happen in inner-city areas, it happens in the most remote and far-flung places of the country. No part of our country is immune from this hideous condition of violence against women and against children.

When I stood up in the Press Club a few weeks ago, I talked about my plan - our plan - to keep Australians safe. And I listed alongside our duties as a Government, whether it comes to our national security or issues of that nature, I listed this amongst our national security objectives. It is as important, if not arguably more. Keeping Australians safe in their homes, in their communities - I can't think of a higher priority. And when it comes to keeping women and children safe, well, I think that speaks of itself for its priority. But if you need any convincing, the statistics are shocking. As we know, on average one woman a week is murdered by her current or former partner. On average, eight women are hospitalised each day due to family and domestic violence. One in four women has experienced physical or sexual violence from a current or former partner, boyfriend, girlfriend or date, since the age of 15. Intimate partner violence contributes to more illness, disability and premature death than any other risk factor for women aged 18-44.

These statistics are just damning. But they're not numbers, they're people. They're girls, they're women, they're daughters, sisters, aunties, mums, grandmums. And when you think about it in those contexts, it's hard to think about anything else, to be honest. That's why I think this issue attracts to it support across all elements of politics, all boundaries of government, into the non-government sector. It is something which I've seen all areas work together on. And Australians should feel reassured about this. This is not an issue that should be a matter of any sort of political or partisan debate, and I don't believe it is. I don't think it should be. And that should be avoided wherever possible. We should focus on the things where we work together.

Our Government's first priority is to keep Australians safe. And we must take action to prevent violence and support the survivors of those who have experienced it. And that's why today I am announcing, through the Fourth National Action Plan, our investment in women's safety. This is a $328 million plan, which is the Fourth National Action Plan, which rounds out the 12 year program that was set back in 2010. The investment is broken up into a series of areas, which I'll ask both Kelly and Paul to speak to. But what I have to stress is it's very focused on prevention. It's very focused on changing attitudes, of all Australians, because disrespect of women and children, while it won't always end necessarily in violence towards women and children, that's certainly where it starts. And our focus on prevention, as Libby will tell you, and as Patty will tell you, is world-leading with a package of this nature. And so that's why I'm proud to announce a program which does focus on prevention, some $68.3 million in prevention. There is a $64 million investment in 1800RESPECT, which has grown both in capability and resource and assistance to those who are affected. And I should stress it doesn't just address the calls of women, it also addresses the calls of men who have been subject to domestic violence as well. Of course, our focus today is on women and children, but I should stress that that service is also available to men. And we acknowledge that that occurs for men as well.

But these services together will ensure that we continue the progress we are making. I wish we were making more progress. I believe we will make more progress. I look forward to the day when a Prime Minister can stand - whether it's here or in the chamber or anywhere else - and say that a young girl being born today won't experience this over the course of the first 20 years of their life. I can't say that today. No Prime Minister could. It's not clear to me what day they will be able to say that, but I know what we're doing today takes us closer to that point. I think we can say fewer will as a result of the efforts that we've put in, and that this plan will deliver. And we'd like that to be reduced to zero. And we have to have that ambition. We have to have that target. But we have to be realistic about the facts as they are on the ground now, and I think this is what this plan does.

I'll finish by saying that this plan has been the outcome of extensive consultation. Cross-community groups, service providers, those who are involved in the day-to-day issues of managing this. Part of this plan, as you know, was announced when I spoke at the National Press Club about the focus on providing support for women's refuges, and providing permanent refuge places. Every single year for women to be able to find those places. I've got to say, as a local member over the last decade, that's been one of the most constant things raised with me in this issue in particular, and so I was pleased to announce that a few weeks ago. But it is the process of a lot of consultation. We have listened, and the plans that you see here are a product of that listening. But I’ll tell you what, we're going to keep listening, we’re going to keep acting and we’re going to keep doing it, until a Prime Minister can stand here and say that a girl growing up today won't face this. So, I'm going throw to Kelly and then to Paul, and then to Libby and Patty.

THE HON KELLY O’DWYER MP, MINISTER FOR WOMEN: Thank you very much, Prime Minister. And as you've heard from the Prime Minister, we have been listening. Listening very carefully to what victims of domestic violence and stakeholders have told us about what it is that we need to do to better address this issue of reducing violence against women and children. And our approach centres around three key themes: prevention, response and also recovery. We have zero tolerance for violence against women and girls, and we want girls and women to know that they can be safe in their homes, in their communities, online and in their workplaces.

But as the Prime Minister has said, a very key focus of this Fourth Action Plan is around prevention. And today we are announcing a world first when it comes to investment in prevention strategies. In fact, we are announcing today the very first National Prevention Strategy. Now, this is going to bring together, with the hub, the Prevention Hub, experts. Experts from across government, national, state and local, experts in reducing violence against women and girls in the media, in our community, and also in business, to make sure that we have got the most comprehensive prevention strategies in place. And we are going to enhance the National Stop It At The Start campaign, which has been so incredibly successful. But we also know that we need to take a multi-layered approach to this as well. We have seen great success with the Quit campaign, where not only has there been strong advertising but also information into schools and into the community at the same time that can see a change of attitude and a change of course of behaviour. And in addition to addressing domestic and family violence, our prevention strategies are also going to have a strong focus on raising awareness around sexual violence and increasing the understanding around issues to do with consent and healthy sexual relationships, particularly for young people.

We are absolutely steadfast in our resolve and our belief that targeted, coordinated and sustained prevention strategies can help to end the vicious cycle of violence. I'm also, of course, very pleased, together with the Prime Minister and the Minister, to announce $35 million to also provide further culturally-based prevention strategies, as well as direct services, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and their children. Sadly, of course, we know that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and their children are disproportionately affected by family, domestic and sexual violence. This, of course, is unacceptable. And all governments have responsibility to listen but also to respond, and to respond very proactively. We have been listening to the voices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and we are working with them on a genuine partnership to develop solutions to end the cycle of violence. And our $35 million package includes ongoing, additional investment to continue and to expand the Indigenous-specific projects previously funded under the Third Action Plan, which will also include an increase in family violence prevention legal services and their capacity to deliver holistic crisis management for Indigenous women and their children, new funding to support Indigenous women and children through intensive case management in areas of high demand, and including in remote areas, so that they're able to access services that work with the whole family and to also address the impacts of violence.

And practical intervention programs to address past trauma and provide the tools and skills that are needed to develop positive and violence-free relationships. And also the $1.7 million that will support the second stage of the Women's Voices national conversation that is being led by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, June Oscar AO. These are important measures. These are measures that will specifically address violence against women and their children. They will reduce the terrible statistics that the Prime Minister has talked about, the statistics that represent the lives of mothers, of grandmothers, of daughters, of sisters, and also of friends and work colleagues. We are absolutely and wholeheartedly focused on this issue and the record investment today will make that difference.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, thank you, Kelly, and for the work you've put into this. And also to you, Paul.

THE HON PAUL FLETCHER MP, MINISTER FOR FAMILIES AND SOCIAL SERVICES: Thank you, PM. Thank you, Kelly. Look, as the Prime Minister and Minister O'Dwyer have made clear, this $328 million package includes a balance between, on the one hand, some very significant measures directed at prevention and long-term attitudinal change, so we reduce the forces underpinning violence against women. But it also includes very substantial funding for front-line services as part of the Commonwealth's contribution to the Fourth Action Plan under the National Plan to reduce violence against women and their children.

For example, part of that $82 million in funding for front-line services is $10 million to deliver specialised family violence services to an additional 16 locations around the country, some 20,000 additional counselling services will be funded under that. And there's initiatives across a range of portfolios. For example, in the Attorney-General's portfolio there will be some $10 million of funding to better coordinate what goes on in the family courts with the work of specialised State agencies that deal with violence against women so that we're getting a better coordination between those two systems. So $82 million for front line services and in addition, $64 million for 1800RESPECT as the Prime Minister touched on. 1800RESPECT is our national counselling service for victims of family and domestic violence and sexual violence. It's been operating for a number of years and the number of calls coming in is increasing rapidly. In 2017/18 there were 98,000 completed calls or internet chat sessions. In 2018/19 that's expected to be 160,000. This funding, this $64 million of funding will be sufficient for 575,000 calls and chat sessions over a 2 year period because more Australians are calling 1800RESPECT. 1800 737 732. I would say to any woman who is listening, indeed any man as well as the Prime Minister mentioned, if you have been exposed to domestic or family violence, please call 1800RESPECT because there are specialised counsellors able to assist and work with you on what the next steps are that you should take. This is a vital front line service: $64 million.

So across this package, a mix of front line services, a mix of long term strategies directed towards prevention. All part of taking a further step on the journey towards that outcome that the Prime Minister has identified of getting towards that point. We're not there yet but we're on the journey towards it, when a young girl can be born and we can be confident that she's not going to be exposed to domestic or family violence. With that, I think we are going to... Patty.

PATTY KINNERSLEY, CEO OF OUR WATCH: Thank you very much. We know that all women and their children should be free from violence and we know perpetrators should be held to account. But we must stop this violence from happening in the first place. That is why we are so pleased that prevention is at the heart of this package. Prevention and the Prevention Hub gives every Australian the opportunity to contribute to this work. We will work with sporting organisations, education institutions, workplaces and with the media to create healthy, equal and respectful communities. The Morrison Government should be congratulated for their commitment to the whole package and particularly to prevention. We look forward to working with you all, to with other Governments and with our key stakeholders to bring this package to life.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you, very much, Paddy, appreciate that. Libby.

LIBBY LLOYD: I would also like to congratulate the Government for its contribution, this big financial boost this time. It's added significantly to what we've been doing. The remarkable thing is that this has been a long-term plan. We have been getting into our 10th year. We have been building over time and it is getting stronger and stronger as we go. This is a big boost to that. The fact that it's gone largely into prevention is a marvellous outcome. I'd really like to congratulate the Government. Thank you very much.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you very much for those comments. Happy to take questions to all of us on the plan and then, as usual, we will deal with the other matters after that.

JOURNALIST: This is coming to the end of a 10-year plan. Yet as you say, the figures are still quite horrific and the numbers are going up for the hotline. Realistically, how long will it take to actually see improvements? Is it a generational thing? Particularly when it is a problem that happens at home and it’s a cycle within families?

PRIME MINISTER: I will let others comment on this as well. This is part of a 12 year programme. This is the fourth 3 year action plan. At the end of that 12 years, I don’t see why there wouldn't be another 12 year programme. I don't see why that would be limited at all. This is one of those great challenges where the finishing line seems to be ever receding, as John Howard used to say. What we hope to do over these next three years is bring that finishing line a little closer to us and hopefully a lot more closer to us. But we are talking about significant longer term generational cultural change and these programs are designed to address that. Others may wish to comment.

THE HON KELLY O’DWYER MP, MINISTER FOR WOMEN: I think also what I would say is in actually having this conversation, in putting domestic and family violence at the heart of the Government, in terms of our focus in tackling this issue, we know that people now also feel more comfortable coming forward in actually seeking help because they know that the help is there. They know that they will be able to get the counselling and support that they need and the interventions that are required. I think we are also seeing, in terms of the numbers, people more willing to actually come forward and also a much greater identification at an earlier stage. One of the great aspects of this particular program, when the Prime Minister talked about the fact that the shocking statistics of eight women being hospitalised every day due to domestic or family violence, one of the elements in this package goes towards having front line providers of health services be able to more readily identify domestic and family violence so those interventions can be made much, much earlier. So I am hopeful that with all of these interventions, with prevention strategies, as well as the response and recovery, all integrated together and Governments working together. As the Prime Minister has said, we are working together with state governments, it doesn't matter what their political stripes, we are united in our purpose in actually trying to lower the impact of family and domestic violence and hopefully, one day, eradicate it altogether.

THE HON PAUL FLETCHER MP, MINISTER FOR FAMILIES AND SOCIAL SERVICES: The comment I would add, Libby talked about the fact that this has been a plan underway now since 2010. $840 million from our Liberal National Government since 2013 towards measures to do with women's safety. Attitudinal change takes time. We know from the research we have done into the Stop it at the Start campaign, where we've had two significant phases of that and the research indicates there is high awareness. 70 per cent of people are aware of that campaign and it is changing attitudes. Some 45 million views of those Stop it at the Start commercials online. We have got money in here, nearly $17 million for the next phase of Stop it at the Start. So there is a balance in this program, in this package, between prevention which necessarily takes a longer term focus and the continuation of those vital front line services.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there seems to be a lot of cases emerging just recently, particularly in sport, of domestic violence and sexual assault. Just going on what Patty is saying about the importance of setting a community example. What's your message to sports administrators as they're dealing with these high profile sports people accused of these crimes? How should they be dealt with - what sorts of examples should they be setting?

PRIME MINISTER: I think the zero tolerance approach is what should be expected and that's what should be done. I think honestly, that's what the fans of the codes, being one of them, would want to see as well. Because sport can actually be a powerful tool to help get this message across. The PM’s XIII match played in Port Moresby was all about carrying the message of stopping violence against women. I should stress our Pacific Step-Up campaign, a lot of the work we're doing in that program is actually taking those messages through our sports programs and other soft diplomacy to get the message out into our Pacific nations as well and work with governments there to address what is also a very significant problem in those communities. So sport can be a real positive to help change the culture. But they've got to change their culture to actually carry that message. I do know that whether it's the AFL, the NRL, soccer, all of the sports codes and their leadership are very engaged in trying to address this. That has to go all the way through the grades. It has to go all the way down to the grassroots level of these sports because that's the culture that needs to change.

JOURNALIST: How does zero tolerance work effectively though, Prime Minister? Somebody accused of a crime isn't allowed to play - is that zero tolerance?

PRIME MINISTER: I think you've put it pretty well.

THE HON KELLY O’DWYER MP, MINISTER FOR WOMEN: Can I also just add, Mark, I think sports stars for a lot of young children in our community, are considered great role models and they have a responsibility that are on their shoulders as a result of that, in terms of their behaviour, the behaviour that they exhibit. On the field and off the field. And I know there's been great work done our lot, so I’m going to invite Paddy to say a few quick words on this because I know male role models are very important.

PATTY KINNERSLEY, CEO OF OUR WATCH: Thank you Minister. Six years ago when Our Watch was established out of the second national action plan actually, we had trouble engaging sporting organisations, workplaces and educational institutions and all of the important places we spend our time in this work because they didn't think it belonged to them. We now have a really strong interest from all of those settings to work with us, where they now say, "We get it, we understand violence against women is not acceptable and we understand we have a role to play but what do we actually do?" So one of the projects we have been funded by the Commonwealth to do is called a national sporting organisations initiative. We have been working with four of the large national sporting organisations to undertake this work. Now it is slow work. We are turning around really entrenched attitudes and behaviours but where we find that the boards are involved, the CEOs are involved and then it threads through the organisation, that changes are being made. This takes time but I'm really confident to say that some of the people leading our national sporting organisations are grappling with it, they are working hard but they are on the path. They can either do nothing and say there is no problem here or they can say we know there is things we need to do, we can't ignore that and we will make a start. So for that I congratulate the sporting organisations for being on the journey.

JOURNALIST: Can I just ask you a question to, coming back to this question of why the figures have been worsening, with domestic violence generally, do you agree because it is of more reporting or is there something going on in society?

PATTY KINNERSLEY, CEO OF OUR WATCH: If you look at the MeToo campaign and women widely report this is the first time they have felt safe to speak, that they will be listened to. So over the life of this plan and the support with this Government, we now have an environment where the culture around us is changing. The media is talking about violence against women differently. Sporting organisations are taking a different responsibilities. Commissioner Jenkins' review on sexual assault is bringing up a whole another layer of conversations. Women are coming forward. They feel like there is a system around them that makes them more safe to speak out. So it is really difficult to say absolutely why the figures are still going up, but we do acknowledge that on the path to improvement, part of it is people feeling safe to speak.

JOURNALIST: And Prime Minister, where is the money coming from for this announcement today?

PRIME MINISTER: It's in the Budget. It is actually committed. It is in the forwards.

JOURNALIST: It was in the midyear Budget review?

PRIME MINISTER: This is fully funded in Budget. The money is right there right now.

JOURNALIST: The Prevention Hub, does it need to be a Federal agency that is fully staffed, in the sense that it is overseeing a lot of activity across the sector because in this area there are lots of not-for-profit agencies and groups all doing different work which can be fantastic work, but may not all be coordinated and may depend entirely on their own ability to raise funds. Is the Prevention Hub a new agency with a dedicated ongoing annual budget?

THE HON KELLY O’DWYER MP, MINISTER FOR WOMEN: This is not about creating another bureaucracy. This is about how we can do things better. It is about drawing together all of the knowledge and the expertise in a way that we have never done before. It is about having a practical impact through those strategies on the ground and in taking the very best learnings and applying it across the board, applying it nationally. One of the great take outs for me, when I attended the COAG minister for first ministers who were women's ministers was we don't talk enough about the things that we are doing that are effective in each one of our jurisdictions and the knowledge is not shared as effectively as it needs to be. There are learnings when things go well and there are learnings when things don't go well. We have to share that better and that is what this will focus on. I know Patty has thoughts around this as well.

PATTY KINNERSLEY, CEO OF OUR WATCH: Out of the work that's happened to date in the second and third action plans, Australia developed a national prevention plan for violence against women and children, it is called change the story, a national framework for the prevention of violence against women and their children. It’s not only a national first, it is a world first. And what that does is it outlines the drivers of violence against women, it outlines the actions we all need to take and it gives everybody in this country a role in order to change the current circumstance. So over the course of the last plans, we have been developing the tools and resources that other people need to lead prevention efforts. What we want to make sure with the Hub is that we don't need to start again. We're not starting from scratch. There is a lot of good tools and resources out there and a lot of evidence base. We want people to come to the evidence base, we want people to use what has been proven as successful. It is about mutually reinforcing, across every part of our community, in partnership, helping people talk to each other, helping people learn so that we actually know that we are being efficient with our Government funding and we are using the evidence base.

JOURNALIST: On another matter, Prime Minister…?

PRIME MINISTER: Any other questions on domestic violence?

JOURNALIST: Minister, on the $35 million for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, what about culturally and linguistically diverse communities? Because obviously there are so much more complications...

THE HON PAUL FLETCHER MP, MINISTER FOR FAMILIES AND SOCIAL SERVICES: Can I just add that in addition to the $35 million directly targeted at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, there's $12 million of funding targeted at culturally and linguistically diverse communities and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities as well. We have some specific funding there targeted at particularly vulnerable or at risk groups and it might be at risk because of obviously potentially poor English language skills or other cultural barriers.

PRIME MINISTER: There is $3.8 million to deliver critical support for identified victims of human trafficking, slavery and slavery-related practices. You will see that in the report. We have taken a very strong position on human trafficking in Australia but also taking a leadership position in our region. This forms part of the plan.

JOURNALIST: You talk about sharing information through the legal system on a Federal and State basis. How far will that information-sharing go, will there be a creation of a national database for authorities to access so that perpetrators don't slip through the cracks or children when they move from state to state?

THE HON PAUL FLETCHER MP, MINISTER FOR FAMILIES AND SOCIAL SERVICES: Well this funding has been allocated so we can work through how there will be better coordination. One of the things that that will see is some funding for state employees to be located within the Family Court system so they're available to people who are going through those processes. But obviously we will be looking at other ways to more tightly coordinate the Family Court, run by the Federal Government and State and Territory agencies.

PRIME MINISTER: Still on the topic of the day?

JOURNALIST: Yes still on the topic. You spoke about violence towards children and disrespect towards children. Have Tony Abbott and John Howard gone too far in supporting George Pell even after his conviction and what message does that support send to victims?

PRIME MINISTER: Bevan, I made my comments on this the other day and my comments were about identifying absolutely with the victims of child sexual abuse within institutions. That is where my thoughts are. Because I know that those events and the reporting of the conviction of George Pell would have stirred all of this up for those tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, who knows, of victims who are out there and they would have re-lived it all again and the pain and torment would have come back. I can't really think much past that, Bevan, to be honest, to be offering commentary on what others should be saying or doing. I just can't get past the pain of those Australians that I met when I delivered the national apology and my only thoughts are for them. If we're moving from domestic violence, we will excuse our... thanks very much, Patty and thanks very much Libby. Thanks for joining us today and appreciate your support for the announcements. Let's move to other matters.

JOURNALIST: Home Affairs has given a Manus Island catering contract to a company without a tender process, worth more than $1,300 per resident per day. Does that sound like good value to you and are you concerned about the profusion of Home Affairs contracts going to companies without competitive tenders?

PRIME MINISTER: Well as you’d know, these contracts and services are a mixture of those which are provided by the Papua New Guinean Government in cases that in some arrangements they have nothing to do with the Australian Government. So I will look at the matter you have raised and come back to you.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister I just wondered, on the SCG board and Michael Daley this morning saying he would sack the board. Do you think that it is an appropriate thing for an Opposition Leader to be saying just because a board perhaps disagrees with his position?

PRIME MINISTER: What is it with the Labor Party at the moment drawing up lists of people they want to sack? I mean, the hubris just doesn't stop. They are drunk with power and they haven't even gone to an election yet, whether it is federally or in New South Wales. I actually haven't seen an Opposition quite carry on like this for some time. I tell you who they really have in their sights, retirees who will have to pay higher taxes, people who just want to get by in life, provide for their future. They will tax them too with the abolition of negative gearing as we know it and increasing capital gains tax. They will wipe out half the tax cuts that we have actually had legislated through the Parliament. For people who just should be allowed to keep more of the money they have earned. They will do the same to small and family businesses. The question is who is next on Labor's hit list? Everybody seems to be on this list. They are drunk with power and they haven't even drunk from the cup as yet. Whether it is with the unions or the rest of it, there is just a hubris and arrogance that has crept into the Labor Party which is extraordinary even for them.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister can you just clarify, are you saying Labor would drive the economy into recession?

PRIME MINISTER: I have made this very clear on I don't know how many occasions. The economy under Labor will be weaker than it is under our Government. The economy under the Coalition will be stronger than it would be under a Labor government. That is my simple point.

JOURNALIST: Will it trigger an election… a recession rather?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I can't predict how bad things would get under Labor. I really can’t. What I do know is if you take $200 billion of higher taxes, punishing aspiration at every level, taking away the incentive of Australians to work hard and do better, that will have a sheet anchor effect on the Australian economy at a time when you can least afford it. This election is about aspiration which is what we want to encourage in Australians, and the negative forces of envy, which is what the Labor Party is relying on. We don't believe that you have to hold some people down to lift other people up. The Labor Party believe they have to tax some people harder to give other people a go. The very package that I have announced today with my colleagues has been announced without increasing taxes. There is no need to increase taxes to do what I have said today. This is a core function of Government and we will do it on that basis. Just as 2,000 extra medicines on the PBS is the core function of Government, just as record funding in hospitals and schools and record bulk billing under Medicare. All achieved without increasing taxes and we don't intend to increase taxes as we've laid out and as you will see in the Budget.

JOURNALIST: On the tax divide between yourself and Labor, the $200 billion you talked about this morning…

PRIME MINISTER: Which Labor's never disputed by the way, because it may be an underestimation, David. I may have got it too low, I may have low-balled them.

JOURNALIST: One area where there is that divide is on personal income tax cuts. You are going to the election at the moment with a tax offset worth $530, Labor is going to the election with a tax offset for millions of workers worth $928, so isn't that on the Labor side better for the economy and better for those workers and why don't you match it?

PRIME MINISTER: Labor is going to the election with a $70 billion program, I am going to the election with a legislated $144 billion program.

JOURNALIST: Theirs is bigger, sooner.

PRIME MINISTER: Ours is structural, it deals with all areas of the tax system and it provides opportunity and rewards incentive right across the board. See, Labor wants to give and take and what I have always learnt with Labor governments is they take much more than they give because Labor can't manage money. I will tell you the reason why they have to always increase taxes to make promises, it is because they can't manage money. When you can't manage money and you can't control your expenditure, you know who gets hit in the neck? Well it’s going to be retirees at $5 billion a year and not just retirees. It’s small businesses who actually benefit from the franked dividend rebates. It is farmers who benefit from the franked dividend rebates, farmers going through drought. Let’s not forget it was the Labor Party who voted against establishing the Drought Fund in the Federal Parliament just a few weeks ago. They can't manage money. That is why they are going to tax you more.

JOURNALIST: It has been reported this week that you're going to travel to Christmas Island. What are you doing to ensure first of all that taxpayers are getting value for money in contracts to look after the asylum seekers that are stay there according to what you are saying? And also, what do you say to what will be inevitable criticism that you're just going to somewhere for a photo-op on taxpayers' expense?

PRIME MINISTER: It is incredibly regrettable that we have to reopen Christmas Island. I had no plans or intentions to reopen Christmas Island. I'm the Prime Minister who shut it. Not only that detention centre but under our Government we closed 19. Labor opened 17. So I regret greatly that the advice of the Department of Home Affairs is that we would have to reopen Christmas Island in response to Labor's Medivac Bill which basically undermines and ends offshore processing as we know it today. That was the recommended response by the Department of Home Affairs and we are implementing their recommendations. We will be making sure that the arrangements are in place, as indeed they are as I understand of this, to stand up that facility up to deal with any transfers that may arise. That is the appropriate response. That is the recommended response of our security agencies and our Department of Home Affairs and we are acting on that. If the Labor Party didn't support that bill, then we wouldn't have to reopen it. It is that simple. The Labor Party have undermined border protection in this country, wilfully ignored the advice of security agencies. And you know what? I still don't know who their minister will be. They have a long list of people they want to sack, but they haven't told us who they will actually appoint to control our borders? Who is it? I don’t know, maybe you guys can share it with me. I don't know who their Minister for Home Affairs is if they're elected to Government. No idea.

JOURNALIST: Julian Burnside...

PRIME MINISTER: No it won't be Julian Burnside.

[Laughter]

I can assure you of that. Not even they would be that crazy.

JOURNALIST: Does Julian Burnside pose any issues for the Treasurer?

PRIME MINISTER: No. He makes a lot of noise. But I’ll tell you what, Julian Burnside won't be able to prevent retirees getting taxed $5 billion a year. A vote for Julian Burnside won't be able to do that. He won't be able to stop Labor's tax attack on the electors of Kooyong. He won’t be able to stop that. There is only one person who can stop that and that is the Treasurer. He is not only going to stop it for the electors of Kooyong, he will stop it for the entire country.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just back on respect for women. Karen Andrews said today that she was talking about female representation inside the Liberal Party. I know you have the 50 per cent unenforceable target for 2025. She was suggesting that perhaps you should settle on a 30 per cent target as a first step. What is your view on that and perhaps I could also ask Kelly O'Dwyer?

PRIME MINISTER: I am just getting on with it.

JOURNALIST: No, getting on with it is just rhetoric…

PRIME MINISTER: No it’s not actually, this is what getting on with it looks like. 19 female members of the Party selected in either Senate or House seats since I became Prime Minister. A record number of women now sitting in my cabinet, the highest of all time. They are actually firm results.

JOURNALIST: One of whom is leaving at the next election.

PRIME MINISTER: And will be replaced at least by one woman if I'm elected at the next election and returned to Government. I was also very pleased, I'm sure everyone at the ABC, including yourself, was pleased to hear that I was able to appoint, with a captain's pick, only the second woman ever to chair the ABC…

JOURNALIST: Your fellow cabinet minister, Karen Andrews is saying 30 per cent.

PRIME MINISTER: If you would like a one on one, you could always issue an invitation. But my point is this. We're just getting on with it. I think people have a clear steer for me about where I place these issues. I have been moving very quickly on these issues since becoming Prime Minister and the results speak for themselves. The results actually do. Others can look at that record but so far, in just six months in the job, 19 female candidates, we have Wendy Askew coming into the Parliament as we come back and even yesterday, one of my proudest days as Prime Minister, the Nancy-Bird Walton airport in Western Sydney and to recognise one of our great aviation pioneers.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can I ask about Yang Hengjun, no one has talked about him now for weeks. He has been in a black prison in China without charge. What can you tell us about him? Has he yet been able to see any of his lawyers or his family? Has he been given access to more consular visits?

PRIME MINISTER: He has had consular access and there is nothing more I can add to that publicly.

JOURNALIST: Has he had access to lawyers?

PRIME MINISTER: I can't anything further to that in this conversation.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if you are saying Labor is going to be bringing in the same industrial relations policies we had during the last recession and bringing in these record tax levels. Is that not threatening they are going to trigger a recession in Australia?

PRIME MINISTER: That is the point you are making.

JOURNALIST: No, isn’t that the point you were making?

[Laughter]

PRIME MINISTER: The point I was making the point that the economy will be weaker under Labor. Whether that could extend to those types of outcomes, that will be more likely under Labor than it would be under a Coalition Government. Because Labor is putting $200 billion and more of higher taxes on the Australian economy and they are bringing back an industrial relations scheme that would make Paul Keating blush. Because it goes back to pre-Paul Keating times. This goes back to the dark ages of industrial relations. When you combine that... at least at that time, the unions weren't able to use their financial muscle to go up with their industrial muscle to start trying to run the Australian economy through industry funds and through their control of a weak Prime Minister in Bill Shorten who owes everything to the union movement. He owes absolutely everything. His job, his role, his standing in life is all a function of the gift of the union movement. He owes them big time. If you want to combine old school industrial relations schemes from the Labor years with that new financial muscle of the unions coming through the industry funds, well yes, that is a very bad recipe for the Australian economy and the economy Australians live in for the next decade will be determined by the choice that is made at this next election. It only takes Labor less than three years to stuff the whole thing. That is all it took them last time. They will change it all in a heartbeat. They will set us on a very different path. We saw it on borders, we saw it on national security, we saw it on defence spending, we saw it on the deficit, we saw it on debt, we saw it on jobs, we saw it with programs that set fire to people’s roofs for goodness sakes. I mean, if I said that when I was door knocking in 2007 people would have thought I was... they needed to call the police. But all of that happened last time the Australian people picked Labor and it has taken us 12 years to get it back. 12 years. Vote Labor once, you will pay for it for a decade. Thank you very much.


NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Prime Minister Scott Morrison and family members of Nancy Bird- Walton at the naming of the Western Sydney International Airport at a ceremony at Badgerys Creek in Sydney, Monday, March 4, 2019.
REMARKS, WESTERN SYDNEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT NAMING

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you very much, Paul. It’s a great pleasure to be here with Premier Gladys Berejiklian and all of our distinguished guests today but, particularly, the Holman family who are the descendants of Nancy-Bird Walton, who we’re here to honour today. Can I also honour the Traditional Owners, the Darug people, and elders past and present and emerging. Can I also acknowledge and honour any Australian servicemen and women, either current who are serving or those who are veterans as well.

Ladies and gentlemen, I have some prepared remarks today which I very much want to share with you. Many great Australians have looked out across our desert expanses or mountain wildernesses and felt adventure calling. And today, we celebrate someone who answered that call. A sky-high moment in Australia’s aviation history is happening right here in Western Sydney. It’s with great pride that as a people, we officially name in honour of one of Australia’s greatest pioneering aviators, the Western Sydney International Airport the Western Sydney International Nancy-Bird Walton Airport.

[Applause]

But let me tell you why because that’s what’s really important. Australia’s story is a tremendous one and it is the story of so many amazing women in our country. We think back to the times out this way – Angus will know about this – to Elizabeth Macarthur, the pioneer of Western Sydney well before today’s times. Right through, it is the story of amazing women.

As a young girl in the 1920s, Nancy-Bird would gaze out and dream of flight. At 17, clutching her life’s savings of 200 pounds, she arrived at Sir Charles Kingsford Smith’s new flying school at Mascot. She spent long days in training and it paid off. She became the youngest woman in the Commonwealth, not just in Australia but in the Commonwealth, to obtain her commercial license. Leading for Australia and leading for women all around the world. But then, for 400 pounds, she bought a Gipsy Moth and she described it as a rattle trap. And from that point, she was truly free as a bird.

Nancy-Bird once described the joy of flying as utter solitude and utter responsibility. You have time to think, she said, time to see, as she put it, how insignificant the scratches man has made upon the surface of this great world. For her great joy invited great risk and it did demand bravery. Barnstorming affairs and race meets across New South Wales and country areas was a death-defying calling. Think about it – a rickety plane brought to life by the spin of a propeller. Wings so fragile, you could put your foot clean through while hopping in. Weather so hot, a bit like today, it shrank the wood and boiled the fuel. Nancy-Bird’s only instruments of navigation were a compass, a watch and a map. But as much as she loved the sheer adventure of flying, Nancy-Bird had more to offer than a daring do. When Reverend Stanley Drummond asked her in 1935 to form the first Air Ambulance for the Far West Children’s Health Scheme, flying nurses in and out of Bourke, she immediately agreed. She served in the Women’s Air Training Corps throughout the Second World War and later devoted herself to numerous charitable works here and abroad, while raising her two young children – one of whom is with us her today – with her husband Charles.

It is now 10 years since her death and Nancy-Bird Walton lived to the age of 93. She had a gift for leadership and bringing people together. She was utterly charming, as I knew from first-hand experience when I met her on several occasions. So, I’m sure this hero of the Australian skies would be proud that the airport named in her honour will be providing much opportunity and enrichment to the workers and families of Western Sydney.

The Australian Government is investing, as you know, $5.3 billion in this airport plus $2.9 billion in surrounding road works, with the project supporting over 11,000 direct and indirect jobs during the construction period and 28,000 full-time jobs within five years of opening, delivering real, long-term benefits to the Western Sydney community. We’re looking at an airport twice the size of Kingsford Smith, which I’m sure Nancy-Bird would have appreciated, with a projected 10 million passengers annually by 2031. And already as you can see around us, it is propelling investment and economic growth in the region. Billions of dollars of road and rail projects have been planned and delivered. The Western Sydney International Nancy-Bird Walton Airport will be an economic game-changer for one of the fastest growing regions in our nation. So how appropriate is it that in the Sydney of 2026, when operations begin, two of Australia’s iconic aviators and pioneers, Nancy-Bird Walton and Charles Kingsford Smith, will be flying side by side here in Sydney.

This project is a project of our government and would not be able to be made possible without the incredible partnership our government has had with the New South Wales Government and I want to commend Gladys Berejiklian as Premier and as a previous Transport Minister and as a Treasurer, in all of these roles, has been so supportive of this project – not just what happens here on site, but what has to happen around this site to ensure the Western Sydney International Nancy-Bird Walton Airport is not just a Western Sydney Airport, which is its primary function, but is an airport for Sydney more broadly and the nation. Gladys has shown tremendous leadership on this project and has been a wonderful and willing partner as we’ve gone about the job of making this a reality.

You want to know what vision looks like? You’re looking at it here at this airport. You’re looking at it right here and it’s taken the teamwork of the Liberal-National Government at both a Commonwealth and a state level to make it a reality. I want to thank very much – I’m sure Michael McCormack would agree as the Deputy Prime Minister – I want to thank Gladys and her team for their wonderful partnership. May it long continue. Gladys Berejiklian, Premier of New South Wales. Thank you.

DOORSTOP, PENRITH NSW

MELISSA MCINTOSH, LIBERAL CANDIDATE FOR LINDSAY: Hi, I’m Melissa McIntosh, the Liberal candidate for Lindsay. We’re here on the beautiful Nepean River in Penrith at the Nepean Rowing Club. Thank you for joining us on this beautiful Autumn day.


PRIME MINISTER: Thank you, Melissa and colleagues who we’re here with today. To Australia’s women’s rowing team, great to be here and spare a few moments with you this morning. Before I make that announcement, can I just say to all of those who have been experiencing the terrible bushfires in Victoria, our thoughts are with you. I’ve been receiving regular reports over the weekend and the good news overnight is that things did settle down quite a bit. I was talking to Russell Broadbent this morning, our local member down there, and Jason Wood last night. Things have improved but there will be some real losses that will be discovered over the next couple of days in terms of property and homes and just know, the state and federal governments are working closely together. I want to thank all those firefighters. Out here in Western Sydney, we know about that as well and we know the work that is done by the Rural Fire Service right across this state and right across the country. 850 firefighters fighting what was a very ferocious blaze there down in Victoria. I’m pleased to hear that the news is better today, but for some the news will be very bad as they are able to get back into their properties and understand what the damage has been in some specific cases.

Yesterday was Clean Up Australia Day and we were reminded of the great work of Ian Kiernan who we lost last year, and it was a great reminder of the incredible power of local communities working to protect their local environment. Our local environment, whether it’s here along the Nepean River or down along the Hawkesbury or up in the Blue Mountains or down in the beautiful Sutherland Shire where my electorate is, it is the quality of our local environment that makes it such a special place to live. Whether you’re an elite sportsperson like our women’s Olympic rowers here today or you’re just having a dip in the lake or in the river or wherever you happen to be, the quality of your local environment is incredibly important. And what better custodians are there of our local environment than our local community organisations who are out there volunteering all the time to make sure they keep the special way that it is. And that’s why today when Melissa Price, our Environment Minister came forward with I think an outstanding initiative to back in the local environment group, the local community groups with $22 million - $150,000 for every single electorate around the country – to back in local organisations that are undertaking important works. Whether it’s weeds management, whether it’s looking after coastal dunes, whether it’s cleaning up, or any of the local environment projects that are so important.

Here in Western Sydney here particularly, on the Nepean, there are issues around weeds management around the river which I know can be a great frustration to the rowers here when their blades get caught and that tends to interrupt your flow when you’re out there training for Australia. Whether it’s that or you’re just taking a swim in the river, you want the local environment to be the best it can and the Communities Environment Program that we’re announcing today does just that. It addresses those local issues, the projects are identified by the local communities. It’s our government backing in local communities to look after their environment and they have the right answers, they have the right projects, and it’s for us to back those projects. This is very much a locally driven initiative so Melissa, I want to thank you for bringing that together. I know Members of Parliament all around the country, our candidates all around the country, will have a very quick and early list of projects which they know should be supported for next year and we look forward to backing in those projects next year. I’m going to hand over the Melissa who’s going to talk a bit more about the program and then we’ll here from Sarah and Marise, who’s doing a wonderful job as Foreign Affairs Minister. You try and match her passion for Western Sydney and you’ll come up short. She’s been working here for a long time and is very familiar with what these projects mean to the local community. So, Melissa.

THE HON MELISSA PRICE MP, MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT: Thanks, PM. It’s wonderful to be back in Lindsay – the second time in the last four days, I think. It’s wonderful to be here. We’ve had a pretty good last seven days with respect to the environment. We’ve announced our $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package only last Monday. We know that we’ll be able to meet our international obligations – that’s what our plan is all about, so I’m very proud of that plan. Today, we’re talking more about cleaner and greener environments and it is wonderful to be here on the Nepean River. I know it looks beautiful but I know there are also some weed problems and I look forward to working with Melissa to be able to find some funding to ensure that we can actually clean up this river once and for good, to be able to help our elite rowers who are here today. Shout out to the lady from Esperance.

This new program is all about identifying local projects, local MPs working with local groups – whether it’s the local Scouts group, whether it’s the local Girl Guides, whether it’s the local council, whether it’s that not-for-profit which ,more often than not, doesn’t actually get the funding. But they are the local community groups that know what’s needed with their environment. I’m very proud of the program. We have a Stronger Communities Program which is quite similar – it works on infrastructure projects in the community – so our local members will know how this works. I’m encouraging our local Members of Parliament to get out there starting talk about what are those local projects. They will probably know what those projects are, so I’m encouraging those scouts groups and also those smaller, not-for-profit groups to start talking to your local members. It really is a wonderful day for the environment. Thanks very much.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks, Melissa. Sarah, tell us a bit about what it means for the Hawkesbury and the mountains.

SARAH RICHARDS, LIBERAL CANDIDATE FOR MACQUARIE: Thank you. I’m Sarah Richards, the Liberal candidate for Macquarie, which is the electorate just next door. It is my pleasure to be here today with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, and the Environment Minister as well as Melissa McIntosh, our fantastic candidate for Lindsay to make this announcement today.

The river behind us actually flows into my electorate and becomes the Hawkesbury River. Environmental issues are extremely important in my electorate of Macquarie, being the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains. So what this announcement does today, it means local community groups who have the local knowledge can get real local environmental solutions on the ground that deliver real results for our community. It’s a privilege to be able to announce this and I know that all the electorates across Australia will be able to benefit from the money that these actual groups can actually apply for and get funding for so we can see benefits in our community. Thank you.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you, Sarah. Marise.

SENATOR THE HON MARISE PAYNE, MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I always say there’s no better place to start my day than in Penrith where I live. Thank you very much, Prime Minister, for organising that for me this morning. It’s a long way from where I was last week. Wonderful to be here on the banks of the Nepean this morning, with may I say, Prime Minister, two of your female Cabinet members and two fabulous female candidates. They are delivering a very strong message about Scott Morrison’s commitment to ensuring that women in the Liberal Party are heading in exactly the right direction and we are very proud to represent you and be part of your team.

Ladies and gentleman here on the banks of the Nepean, in the shadow of the rowers, and I’m not sure where Greg’s gone – over there – shadow of the rowers, the Nepean Rowing Club over here. This is an iconic part of Australia. When I was a kid, my family used to bring me here for the regatta – the GPS regattas – and you couldn’t move on the banks of the Nepean in those days. For the Sydney 2000 Olympics, we built the Regatta Centre. But it hasn’t changed the importance of the life and the health of the Nepean River. So knowing that we’re going to be able to make a contribution today with the program that Melissa Price has announced is really important. I live just slightly south of here in the Mulgoa Valley in Lindsay. In Lindsay, the Mulgoa Valley Landcare Group, our conservation volunteers, the Cumberland Plain preservation groups are all the sorts of key, grassroots, community-based organisations that I think are going to jump at this program, Melissa. And they are going to be all over the opportunities it presents to preserve our communities across Western Sydney. Whether it’s South Creek or Cabramatta Creek. Whether it’s the Blue Mountains and whether it’s further north in Sarah Richard’s area of Macquarie. The difference that community organisations make is the difference that we can make in Western Sydney. Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here today, Prime Minister. Thank you all for joining us. It’s fantastic to see our elite rowers here. We know how hard you work, we know how important this waterway is to you but most importantly, we know what you do for Australia. We’re immensely proud to be here with you this morning. Thank you very much.

PRIME MINISTER: Let’s take some questions now on this project and program specifically as normal. And Melissa is here to answer questions on those as well. And as usual we’ll move to other topics of the day.

Well, it sounds like we’re moving to other topics. I’m so pleased that we’ve been so comprehensive in spelling out the real benefits of this program and I do mark again the memory of Ian Kiernan and the wonderful job that he did. We had a bit to say obviously about that last year when we lost him, but I think these types of programs wouldn’t have occurred were it not for his leadership and alerting us to the importance of local community grassroots organisations looking after our environment. This is really, I think, a tribute to him.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can I ask you about the Indonesian Free Trade Agreement?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

JOURNALIST: Do you have any concerns that it won’t pass Parliament?

PRIME MINISTER: I do welcome the fact today that it is being signed today, the Indonesian Free Trade Agreement. The Minister for Trade, Simon Birmingham, is up there in Indonesia to do that. That was always the arrangement that the trade ministers would conclude that arrangement when the President and I first discussed this matter soon after I became Prime Minister, so we are both very pleased to see that now coming to fruition. It is the normal process for it to pass through our respective Parliaments and legislatures. The Liberal Party is voting for it, the National Party is voting for it. The Labor Party has often baulked on these arrangements in the past, so that would be the only risk to it as far as I can see, if the Labor Party were to play politics with it. I see no reason why they would want to choose to do that, that would only harm Australia’s economic interests if they did. But it’s just another in a string of achievements where our government has been expanding the borders of our trade and what that means is local jobs at the end of the day. Whether it’s what we’ve done through the China Free Trade Agreement, Japan, Korea and now Indonesia, the TPP-11. All of these have been leadership initiatives from our government to ensure that small, medium and family size businesses can get access to markets that they never would have got before. It’s been great for all of those businesses and this agreement will be great for them too.

JOURNALIST: Labor has expressed some concerns that clauses though within the agreement would see private companies being able to bring court action against the Australian Government.

PRIME MINISTER: Labor never acts in the interest of the Australian economy. That’s why I keep saying Labor will make our economy weaker, not stronger. And Labor wants to put more than $200 billion worth of higher taxes on the economy. That will make our economy weaker, not stronger. And you know if you make the economy weaker, then you can’t support programs like this I’ve announced today. You can’t support the 2,000 affordable medicines that we’ve been on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. As we know when Labor were last in power, they had to stop listing important, affordable medicines on the PBS because they couldn’t manage the budget. So Labor, they don’t get the economy. They can’t manage money and they don’t have the right instincts for managing our economy and that’s why on agreements like this they do baulk because they just don’t get it when it comes to managing the economy.

JOURNALIST: But their concern is specifically about a clause which would open the Australian Government up…

PRIME MINISTER: No, I think I’ve addressed that. Labor just don’t know how to manage the economy and they don’t know how to manage money and so it never surprises me when they do things that would harm our economy.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, over the weekend it was announced two of your Cabinet Ministers would be resigning.

PRIME MINISTER: They’re retiring at the next election.

JOURNALIST: Retiring. There’s now speculation that Craig Laundy will also be leaving. Have you spoken to him about whether that’s his intention?

PRIME MINISTER: I’ve been in contact with Craig since last August when I became Prime Minister and those matters will be addressed when we’re in a position to do that.

JOURNALIST: Following on from that, Prime Minister, has Kevin Andrews indicated any intention to retire?

PRIME MINISITER: No.

JOURNALIST: You’ve said that seven women will be in Cabinet…

PRIME MINISTER: Seven women are now in the Cabinet. Linda Reynolds was sworn in on Saturday and there are seven women now in Cabinet. That is the highest number of women ever in a Federal Cabinet in Australia. That is something a Liberal-National Government has delivered and it’s something that I would certainly continue should we be successful on the other side of the election.

JOURNALIST: Are you saying then that there would be quotas for Cabinet?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I’m just saying that I have no problem filling seven slots for women in my Cabinet and potentially more because I’ve got so many great women to choose from.

JOURNALIST: You mention that Linda Reynolds was appointed on merit after an extraordinary career, but why’s it taken her so long to rise to Cabinet then?

PRIME MINISITER: She only joined the Parliament in 2013 and she has served I think a very important apprenticeship on the backbench. I promoted her at the first opportunity when I became Prime Minister as Assistant Minister, particularly looking after emergency services. She has done such an outstanding job in that portfolio. You get to test the mettle of people when you put them in a job like that and her mettle was tested absolutely. The comfort and focus that she’s brought to dealing with the disasters, whether it’s been in Tasmania or chatting to one of the rowers down from the Huon Valley or up in North Queensland, and she continues to hold those portfolio responsibilities in Cabinet for emergency management and disaster recovery in North Queensland. Linda Reynolds, I think, has been warmly received as an outstanding appointment and she’s there because she’s the right person for the job.

JOURNALIST: So you don’t agree that the Liberal Party should consider quotas as Alex Hawke said?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I’m saying we’ve got a record number of women in the Cabinet and we’ve got so many outstanding female candidates running at this election. I’m surrounded by Sarah and Melissa here, but there’s been, I think, 19 female members selected as candidates or coming into Senate positions. Wendy Askew is going to join us when we come back to the Parliament in a months’ time. She’s taking David Bushby’s place out at of Tasmanian Senate team. We have women leading three of our tickets in the Senate and here in the New South Wales, in Western Australia and in South Australia. And so I’m positive about the direction we’re taking, we’ve got further distance to go. But my team understand my commitment to this issue. At the end of the day, it’s all about results and I’m known for getting results.

JOURNALIST: Speaking of women, Julie Bishop has claimed she could’ve beaten Bill Shorten if she had been made leader of the Liberal Party. Do you agree with her assessment?

PRIME MINISTER: I thank Julie for her outstanding service to our country, to our Party, and I wish her all the best in her retirement.

JOURNALIST: Is that a no?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I’m just thanking Julie for her position and what she’s done for our Party and I wish her well in her post-politics career.

JOURNALIST: There’s been some commentary around the New Zealand High Commissioner appointment. Why shouldn’t Patricia Forsythe’s appointment be seen as a plum job for a mate?

SENATOR THE HON MARISE PAYNE, MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: From time to time, I think governments historically of all political colours have made key appointments in postings around the world. I’ve worked with many of them over time including, of course, Kim Beasley as our excellent ambassador to Washington. If you have a highly qualified, distinguished leader who’s available for an appointment such as this and if the opportunity presents itself, then I think then it’s an appropriate appointment. And certainly, Patricia Forsythe fulfils those standards. I am interested, though, that the Labor Party has decided to take this approach. Apparently, thought it only applies to one side, I know the list they’ve carefully given to the Sydney Morning Herald doesn’t happen to include Craig Knowles, a former Labor Party state minister who was appointed as the Consul-General in Auckland by our government in January last year. They’ve left him off. I know that my good mate Roger Price, the former Labor member for Chifley, succeeded in a spectacular fashion as our Consul-General in Chicago for some years and gave great service to his country following his long, distinguished parliamentary career here in Western Sydney. It is something that occurs from time to time when they opportunity is appropriate and when the person fits the bill. In this case, I think Mrs Forsythe will be an excellent High Commissioner. We’ve recently welcomed Dame Annette King, of course, to Australia as New Zealand’s High Commissioner here. She had distinguished service as a Labor Member of Parliament in New Zealand and so, it is not unusual and if the candidate is as outstanding as Mrs Forsythe, then I think it’s appropriate.

PRIME MINISTER: I’ll just make a comment on that as well. I know Patricia Forsythe well as well and I think she is an outstanding appointment. When Marise recommended her to me, I didn’t hesitate. And you make the right point about Dame Annette King. When you’re having someone represent your government, New Zealand is one of those very close and very important relationships and Annette Kind is very close to Jacinda Ardern. That’s a good thing because you’re dealing with Annette you know that there is a very close connection to the Prime Minister and I think that adds further weight to the nature of the representation that New Zealand is providing here to Australia. We are reciprocating that and I think that will provide I think for an excellent dialogue and engagement with New Zealand. It was something I felt very strongly about and to have another female appointed to a very prestigious post in our diplomatic service, I think, again, just counters the things that are put about… and I’ll also say this – what is it with Labor when they’re going around drawing up hit lists for about who’s about to get jobs? What are they going to do, start going over the gardeners list about who they think is acceptable? I mean, so arrogant have they become, that they are already talking about the people they want to sack when they get into power. That seems to be the only thing that drives them – getting hold of power to wield it. Whether it’s against small and family businesses with their higher taxes or, you know, who’s next with Labor? That’s the thing – they just want to get into power to wield power on behalf of, talking about mates, their union mates, in particular their militant union mates like John Setka. These guys have become very arrogant. I mean, I’m still waiting to know who is going to be their Home Affairs Minister? Who is going to be the Labor Minister, if they’re elected, that is responsible for keeping our borders strong? Who is going to be the Defence Minister because apparently Richard Marles might be the Home Affairs Minister. In my team, you know who the Defence Minister is, you know who the Foreign Minister is, you know who the Treasurer is, you know who the Deputy Prime Minister is. It’s a very clear and stable team. With Labor, we don’t know who is running these important positions and it’s about time Bill Shorten ended the speculation around this. Tell us who’s going to keep the border secure, Bill. Because at the moment, you don’t seem to know and the Australian people don’t know.

JOURNALIST: Can we just talk about foreign affairs really quickly on North Korea? The US and South Korea have both announced they’ll be drawing down their military exercises. What’s your reaction to that?

SENATOR THE HON MARISE PAYNE, MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: I think last week’s Summit in Hanoi, which I must say was particularly well hosted by Vietnam – they put a great deal of effort into what was an extremely important meeting – it continues the path in the right direction. These are very complex matters. We know that. They were never going to be resolved overnight and I commend both the President of the United States and Kim Jong-un for the engagement they have had during these sessions. In terms of engagement, there have been long discussions in relation to military exercises and decisions, those decisions were made on a case by case basis. Australia has a good reputation in terms of our participation in those activities over time. But most importantly, I think it’s really very, it’s crucial to recognise the complexity of this issue and the fact it will take time to resolve.

PRIME MINISTER: I’ll only add to that that I welcome the initiatives by President Trump to make progress on this issue. It’s very difficult and his determination to keep pressing forward, there will be frustrations, but I really commend his heartfelt commitment to try and make some progress in this area and, likewise, I commend the Vietnamese Government on their hosting of the program.

We’re going to have to wrap it up in a sec.

JOURNALIST: Just one last question. When Parliament resumes, will you seek to fix the medevac bills or are you committed to spending more than a billion dollars to the reopening of Christmas Island?

PRIME MINISTER: There is no form of the medevac bill which makes our borders stronger. The only thing that I would ever seek to do is repeal it in its entirety and the Australian people will have the opportunity to talk about that at the next election.

Now, we’re going to have to go because something also very exciting is happening today and that is, we are naming the Western Sydney Airport the Western Sydney Lady Nancy-Bird Walton Airport here in Western Sydney. She is Australia’s first aviation pioneer and I think that to have our twin airports here in Sydney, the Western Sydney Airport and the Sydney Airport, one named after our greatest ever male aviation pioneer and our other named after our greatest female aviation pioneer, I think, is a real tribute to this city in terms of what it produced and in terms of our aviation pioneers in this country. But Western Sydney airport, the Nancy-Bird Walton Airport, is going to be an enormous economic boom for Western Sydney. Western Sydney has always taken every opportunity economically that has come their way and this one is an absolute big one. They are embracing it and getting behind it and the jobs that will come – almost 30,000 just in the early phases – this is going to be a tremendous thing for Western Sydney and we look forward to joining Premier Berejiklian out there on the road today. Great to be there with Gladys – she is doing an extraordinary job as New South Wales Premier and we’ll be working very strongly to support her re-election in a few weeks’ time.

Thank you very much.

[ENDS]PRESS CONFERENCE, CANBERRA ACT

PRIME MINISTER: Good morning everyone, it’s a beautiful morning here in Canberra. Today, I’m pleased to announce that Senator Linda Reynolds will be sworn in as a Cabinet Minister today here in Canberra by the Governor General in a few moments' time. Senator Reynolds has had an extraordinary career. I am sure many of you probably do know that she is a Brigadier in the Army Reserve. She has worked with our most senior people in our defence forces, and so after I received the advice from both Steven Ciobo and Christopher Pyne that they would not be recontesting the next election, and after Steven advised me that in those circumstances, with two ministers in defence portfolios, is that he thought it was the best thing to do to stand aside also from the Ministry to enable me to make an appointment into a defence portfolio but also to flag very clearly that should we be successful at the next election, and my Government is re-elected, that Linda Reynolds also would become the Minister for Defence in my Government if we return to the next election. 

So today she is being sworn in as the Minister for Defence Industry. She is also being sworn in as the Minister for Emergency Management, and also the Minister for the North Queensland Recovery. As you know, yesterday in Townsville I made an announcement about our North Queensland Livestock Industry Recovery Authority, which Shane Stone is leading, and that Authority reports directly to me. Linda will continue to work very closely with me on that incredibly important issue for North Queenslanders. Since I elevated her to the executive after becoming Prime Minister, Linda has shown an incredible ability to get things done, and that is what I look for in people who are part of my team, that they can get things done, they know how to get things done. And Linda has demonstrated that outside of this place and inside of this place. And so it wasn't a difficult decision at all to make this decision to elevate her both into Cabinet, but particularly to put her into a defence portfolio. 

Now, of course, that elevation comes as a result of two members of the ministry, of the Cabinet, who have decided not to recontest the next election, and Christopher Pyne and Steven Ciobo, I want to thank both of them for their many years of service. I mean, Christopher Pyne has spent more time in this place than he has been on the planet, he has spent more than half of his time, I should say, in this place, then he has been on the planet. Maybe it felt like the whole time, I am not sure. But I want to thank Christopher for his service to our country. 26 years is a very long stint in the Parliament, and as he said this morning, at some point all members have to make those decisions about the future, and today that was announced both in Christopher's case and also in Steven's case, and Steven was first elected back in 2001. He has also served a very long time here in the Parliament and both men have achieved a great deal during their time here, and they have already made mention of all that this morning, and I would only reflect on that, that has been an excellent period of service for both of them, and they have made their decisions going forward. 

So what has changed today and what hasn't changed today? What's changed today, of course, is we have two members of the Cabinet who have decided not to recontest the next election. That's true. What has also changed today is we have elevated Senator Reynolds into the Cabinet, which means there will now be seven women in our Cabinet. Already my Government had the equal highest number of women in Cabinet, along with the Rudd government, with six women in Cabinet, and also that was true of the Turnbull government. This now makes our Cabinet the strongest level of female representation in the history of Federation, and that is something that I would intend to continue should we be elected at the election in May. 

JOURNALIST: Is that a bit ironic, Prime Minister...

PRIME MINISTER: I haven't finished yet, sorry. Seven women in the Cabinet, I think is a great way to start the week when we go into international Women's Day, amongst many other things, and because we are a Government that has been delivering for women, and to have seven women in the Cabinet is something I think that Liberals and Nationals can feel very proud of in terms of where we have got to today. 

I will tell you what hasn't changed today, though. What hasn't changed today is our Government's record for delivering a stronger economy. What hasn't changed today is our Government's plan to deliver a stronger economy into the future. The plans that I have laid out for a stronger economy, for a stronger position on national security, for stronger borders, all of these plans remain in place, and I have  the team in place to achieve that. Josh Frydenberg leading as Treasurer, Peter Dutton leading as Home Affairs Minister. Linda Reynolds, who will serve as the Defence Minister if we are reelected. Marise Payne serving as Foreign Affairs Minister. Of course we have outstanding Ministers in Greg Hunt and Dan Tehan leading the way in education and in health. These are the portfolios that drive much of what governments do and there are many others, I acknowledge that. 

But you know who our people are, going forward into the election, who will perform those roles. Bill Shorten can't tell you who his Home Affairs Minister will be. We still don't know. Who will be apparently stopping the boats if Bill Shorten is the Prime Minister? And because there is so much confusion about that, we don't even know if Richard Marles will be the Defence Minister if Bill Shorten is elected, because it has been made pretty clear that he is an option for them to serve in Home Affairs. So the irony is this - the contrast, actually, today could not be more clear. Our team is very, very certain in terms of who will take on these key roles in my Government, and they are people who have been performing these roles, in many respects now, for many years. And ultimately, at the end of the day, Australians will make a choice about who they want to lead this country, and they will make a decision between me as Prime Minister and Bill Shorten as the Leader of the Opposition. And that hasn't changed. 

We have a plan to make Australia stronger. Bill Shorten's plans will make Australia weaker, and at the end of the day that will be the choice that Australians will make as we go to the election in May. So I’m going to ask Linda to make a few comments and then I am happy to take questions.

SENATOR THE HON LINDA REYNOLDS: Prime Minister, thank you very much and I am incredibly privileged and humbled to have been appointed the Defence Industry Minister today, and also to attain responsibility for Emergency Management and also Queensland Reconstruction. My career, my whole life up until now, I think has prepared me exceptionally well for this role. This role is about, in my mind, two things. It is about ensuring that our 80,000 men and women who serve our country in uniform have the best possible equipment that we can provide them. Secondly, it is about ensuring that we use as much as possible of Australian industry resources in supporting our own men and women. And having not only served in the Australian Army for nearly 30 years but also having worked in defence industry and working with defence industry for many years, I know just how capable our people are, right across this country. And I've got to commend this Government. My role will also be over the next few months to make sure that we keep rolling out the $200 billion that we are investing in upgrading our entire military forces, our Army, our Air Force, our Navy, and also new capabilities in cyber and in space. We are developing to meet the changing and not necessarily more secure geostrategic environment we are facing globally. 

So Prime Minister, thank you very much for your confidence in me, and I can say that I will give this job absolutely everything, because I understand how important this role is. And there is no greater responsibility for any Prime Minister or any Minister in the defence portfolio, than the safety and security of all Australians. So Prime Minister, thank you.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, thank you, Linda, I should also say I deeply appreciate the support of Michael McCormack as the Deputy Prime Minister. Obviously in responding to this latest set of decisions of two of the Ministers, I consulted with the Deputy Prime Minister and in the Deputy Prime Minister, you know the team between him and I is a very strong coalition.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you at all worried that this mass exodus is damaging your potential campaign in the lead up to the election?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I am not, because... No, I am not, because the election is about what we are going to do and what we have done. You know, the personalities will change from time to time. But it is what you are doing that matters, and what you are going to do that matters. 1.25 million jobs is what my economic plan is going to deliver over the next five years. Stronger national security and stronger borders, based on the National Security plan that I outlined a few weeks ago. That is what we’re going to do and I have the people in place to do that. It is about what needs to be done, and ensuring you have the people who can do it, and my Government can tick both of those boxes. And so there will be a very clear contrast at the next election between a plan for and credentials to deliver a stronger Australia, which is my Government's plan, and the Labor Party and Bill Shorten's plans that will deliver a weaker Australia.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you are about to head to Yarralumla. What do you say to those who say you should call an election while you are there? 

PRIME MINISTER: No, because we will be handing down the first surplus Budget in early April. See you know Brett, as Prime Minister there are many things that happen, that come along, some foreseeable and some not. But the real test for people who stand in this position is how they deal with those issues. I don't get distracted by these things. I always just remain absolutely focused on the job I have for the Australian people, and that is to ensure that our country is stronger, that our economy is stronger, that they are safer, and I can bring and continue to bring the country together. So that is what I am focused on. I don't get flapped by things like this. I just keep going. Because I am clear about my plans and I know what we need to achieve, and I got the people to do it.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, it doesn't appear that you have a praetorian guard. Have you been let down here?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I mean don't even understand the point of the question.

JOURNALIST: On the resignations of Minister Pyne and Minister Ciobo, they have been talking to you about it for some time. As you say, Christopher Pyne has been here for 26 years, did you ask either of them to reconsider their decisions to leave politics?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, when both of them came to me - and with Christopher it was only in the course of this past week, earlier in the week, and with Steven it was a couple of weeks ago - but there were things we still had to focus on at that time, and we were working through Parliament and our focus was on that and not on these matters, so I said we would deal with them in turn. In both of the cases, of course if they had wisheda to continue I would have welcomed that. But particularly in Christopher’s case, 26 years as a long time. HG and Roy used to have that great saying, too much is never enough. Well I don't think Christopher Pyne would even agree with that in relation to himself. So look, they have made their decisions, I understand them, I respect them. 

But I think what it demonstrates, when I can pull Brigadier off the bench in the Assistant Minister ranks to take on a role in the defence portfolio, and raise the number of women in our Cabinet to seven, the highest number of women ever in an Australian Cabinet, which will be continued under my Government, I think that demonstrates the strength of where our party is out. And when you think when you have people like Doctor Katie Allen, who have joined our ranks in Higgins, seeking election in the seat of Higgins - a paediatrician, a research scientist, a mother. You have Warren Mundine who has joined our team, a vote of confidence in our team, and Warren's leadership in indigenous affairs, but more actually importantly in creating jobs for people in rural and regional Australia, I think these things demonstrate that people want to get on board with our team. And in both of these cases where we will have selections and we will ensure that we will have members who will carry that forward and further bolster the ranks. I mean, Christopher has made that point himself today. It is an opportunity for new people to come into those roles. 

I mean, in the last... since I have become Prime Minister, 18 women have been selected in either Senate or House of Representatives seats. 18, and two and the National Party as well, both in the New South Wales Senate and in the seat of Mallee, which I think are very important seats. And you've got three of our Senate tickets at this election, including in Western Australia, all being led by women. So look, I think we've got a very strong story to tell there, and we will continue to move forward in that area.

JOURNALIST: PM, you said that you were going to maintain at least seven women if you are reelected. Has that become almost a de facto quota for you for having... and given that one of those women currently in the Cabinet is Kelly O'Dwyer and she is coming out, are you telling every woman who is standing for the Liberal Party and the National Party at this election that they are a chance of coming into Cabinet?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, everyone is a chance, I suppose, and there will be some vacancies that I will fill if we are successful at the next election, and that is when I intend to fill them. We have ministers who are serving well, and let me particularly be clear about the case in Christopher Pyne'sportfolio. We are dealing with some quite sensitive issues presently in the defence portfolio, and I think for the sake of continuity it is very important that, through the election period that Christopher, based on his involvement in those issues as a member of the National Security Committee, I think it is a very wise and responsible thing for him to continue on and perform that role at this time. I mean, yes, we could have appointed Linda to that role today. But I think the responsible thing to do is exactly what I have done in this case.

SENATOR THE HON LINDA REYNOLDS: And Prime Minister, I might add I think what the message is clearly saying is to every woman in the Liberal Party today and every woman that will get elected is that you don't need to be a quota. If you are good enough, you could get in. I think that is what it is saying, is we have an incredibly talented team of women in the Liberal Party that I am absolutely privileged to serve with. And I have been appointed not because of my agenda but because of my experience, and we have got many other women who equally are capable, and what the Prime Minister has done is demonstrated to them that they too can succeed because they have the talent.

JOURNALIST: Will any other ministers be announcing that they are also stepping down before the next election?

PRIME MINISTER: That is not my understanding… that’s not my understanding. 

JOURNALIST: What have you done to make sure of that? Have you asked…?

PRIME MINISTER: I talk to them all the time.

JOURNALIST: You talk about the number of women in your Cabinet, but it is true that there aren't as many women as some would like on the benches of Parliament, the backbench and frontbench. Do you think that the people who are replacing Minister Pyne and Minister Ciobo in the seats of Sturt and Moncrieff should be women?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, it is a matter for the selectors to determine, I am not going to prejudge that, and should that be the case I think that would be a positive development. But that will be a matter ultimately for those selectors. But as I said, 18 women selected in these critical seats going into this next election, including Senate positions. I mean, Wendy Askew is about to come into the Senate replacing David Bushby out of Tasmania. We have got Jessica Whelan down there in Lyons, we have Bridget Archer down there in Bass and Jacinta Price up there in Lingiari. I mean, Fiona Kotvojs out there in Eden-Monaro. This is an impressive group of women candidates we have got running at the election. I was down in Tasmania just as you know over the course of this week, I have been a quite a few times over the last several weeks, as I am sure you have noticed. And in each of those Labor seats, I think they are providing a really great alternative to see further Tasmanian representation in the House of Representatives in my Government.

JOURNALIST: The Ministers leaving are relatively young in political terms. Why would people...

PRIME MINISTER: Christopher will be so flattered you have referred to him in that way. He will be overwhelmed.

JOURNALIST: ...and the others such as Kelly O'Dwyer in recent departures. But they are relatively young in political terms, why would people so young be leaving if they thought they could win? 

PRIME MINISTER:  Well, Christopher has been here for 26 years. That is a very long time. I understand he is one of the longest serving, if not the longest serving, South Australian member of the House of Representatives ever. And I am sure Christopher can give you a long list of all the other milestones that he has reached, and he will take that opportunity, no doubt. But Steve Ciobo has been here since 2001, Michael Keenan has been here since 2004. He has one infant child and three other children, it is a long way from Western Australia. It is a tough grind. And you will be very well aware of Kelly O'Dwyer's very personal and very specific circumstances. So I would encourage media, frankly, to see each of these decisions in their own right, because they have been made by individuals, by people. Human beings who have made decisions about their own lives and their own future. 

And what I am telling the Australian people, those decisions can be made, but my Government will remain absolutely on track to ensure that we continue to create the jobs which Australians rely on, that we can have the strong funding of essential services that Australians rely on, because it is strong funding. I mean, I talked about Greg Hunt before. 2,000 medicines listed on the PBS, and the highest rate of bulk billing ever. That is the result not just of funding, but strong funding backed up by a stronger economy. So we will remain focused on the job, what needs to be done, and I have got the people to do it. I have already noted that I don't know who Bill Shorten is going to have when it comes to Home Affairs or stopping the boats. I know who will be stopping them on my watch, Peter Dutton and me, and the people smugglers know that, and that is why they are not trying it on with us. But I will tell you what, they will certainly try it on with Bill Shorten, and whoever he has in mind to do that job.

JOURNALIST: Do you have any ongoing links with the ADF through the Reserves or anything and have you had to seek any legal advice whether that might present a conflict?

SENATOR THE HON LINDA REYNOLDS: When I first stood for preselection in 2012-13, I did transfer to the standby Reserve, so there is no constitutional issue, if that is what you are asking, in relation. So yes, I am still technically a member of the Australian Army as an inactive Reserve member, so I retain my rank but I don't serve.

PRIME MINISTER: We are going to have to go, because we have to swear Linda in, so thank you very much.DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, TOWNSVILLE QLD

Queensland flood recovery; Townsville pipeline; Parliamentary retirements; Benjamin Netanyahu
LNP CANDIDATE FOR HERBERT PHILLIP THOMSON: Thank you for coming today. I would like to welcome everyone standing behind me and in welcoming back the Prime Minister of Australia. He’s been coming to Townsville quite regularly lately. Also, Minister Reynolds. We’ve got George Christensen. Frank Beveridge, the candidate for Kennedy. As well as Frank and Ron, whose businesses we are here today and we’ve been speaking with. The Prime Minister loves Townville. He comes back quite a lot. Comes here when it’s sunny. Comes here when it’s raining. Comes here during a disaster and comes here to make announcements for our recovery. I’d also like to make mention, of another announcement that was in the paper yesterday. The following on, on Stage 2 of the Townsville water pipeline, which is our project plan, being awarded to a local business. It’s an international business, but it’s local here, so local people will be getting employed. And that’s something that we definitely need. You know, we’ve had a one in 2000  year flood, here in Townsville but, you know, we need to be having long-term water security. Because it will only take a very short time, once again, we’ll be in a drought here. So I’d like to thank everyone for being here and welcome the Prime Minister. Thanks.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks. Well Phil, it’s great to be here with you and all those who have joined us here today. There is a number of things I wanted to speak to today. Last time I was here, in this very… this shop, the water would have been over our feet at that time when I was last here in Townsville. And on that same day, with George and Ian McDonald and then Phil, we were in parts of Townsville where families were coming back to their water-logged homes. And we experienced, you know, the shock and the grief that they were going through. And I said that we would continue to stand by them as we moved through the recovery centres and we sat down with the emergency authorities. Linda who’s been back to Townsville many times and based herself up… Linda Reynolds is the Emergency Management Assistant Minister. To ensure we got the right recovery reconstruction plan in place. And that’s what we love doing as a government is to be there when parts of the country absolutely need us. But always looking to see how we can make all parts of the country stronger. On previous occasions when I’ve been to Townsville it’s been about the port upgrade. That was one of the first visits I made here as Prime Minister. And then there was the water plan and the water pipeline, both of which are key parts of Phil’s plan for here in Townsville.

But today it’s about how we’re continuing to support the recovery in the wake of the worst floods we’ve seen here in Townville. And not just here but across the range, right across north and western Queensland. The devastating impact and the speed at which those floods hit here in north Queensland was quite terrifying. And the impact both socially, economically and otherwise, has been quite devastating. And I’ve had the sad opportunity to see it firsthand and speak to many people who have been affected.

There are three stages to your response. The first one is the immediate disaster assistance payments. About $110 million worth of support payments have already been made here in Townsville, and across north-western Queensland. Payments directly to shires and councils to support the work they do. Payments directly to those impacted, and we sped up the process and the eligibility of those payments. In the first week of the flood, almost $40 million had gone out to support people straight away. And I think that was very important to demonstrate (a) we were absolutely serious in turning up for the people of Townsville as they were hit by those floods and elsewhere. Particularly, they got those checks in hand. So they can deal with the things that they had to deal with, to get back up on their feet. And so it’s amazing to stand in this business just a few weeks later and see them trading. And the stories of community support and customer support coming in and helping with the clean-up are just tremendous and, I think, go to the spirit of Townsville and the resilience and the family nature with which Townsville has responded to this crisis. Now those payment are done with the state government. The Queensland Government has stood up through Major General Smith, a coordinator-general for the flood recovery… disaster recovery process. The Commonwealth is working closely, hand-in-glove with the Queensland Government. I spoke again with the Premier again this morning. That process is about rebuilding roads and rebuilding rail lines whether its’s out past Julia Creek or here in Townsville. And there is the established processes for disaster recover that enable that to take place. And Linda has been our… on the ground here… a presence working with the Queensland state government to identify what those priorities are together with Michael McCormack, who has also come through on many occasions to ensure we’re working that through.

Today I’m announcing that we are increasing the Category D assistance, the support we provide to small business. That will increase together with the Queensland government from $25,000 to $50,000, in support for those businesses that have been impacted and had their business impacted by the recent floods. And they are to get in touch with the Queensland government because they manage this payment process. And I know that many of those business have been working through the process of their insurance companies. Because the insurance company payments and these support payments go hand in glove as well. And I know they’re working through that process. Now I’ve got tell you, and George Christensen has brought this to my attention here today. I’ve got to say that the response from the insurance companies has been a bit hot and cold in some cases. You know, I think they’ve been doing a great job. In other cases, frankly a bit iffy. And I want to put them on notice. You better show up. You better do the right thing by the people of Townsville and right across north-western Queensland. And I know there are many cases where that has been done. I’ve been giving them the benefit of the doubt. But I can ensure if they do not turn up, and if they apply blanket policies which seek to exclude people from getting the support they need and to try and get the insurance companies off the hook, I will not hesitate to take whatever actions I have available to me to make sure you do.

The third point relates to how we rebuild the north Queensland livestock industry. The way that this particular event hit north-western Queensland is unlike anything we’ve seen elsewhere in the country. We’ve got farmers going through the most horrific of droughts. Whether it’s in Queensland, where it’s been going for seven years. Or down where I was last weekend in Gippsland, in southern Victoria, where they’ve been for the last 18 months. But droughts happen in slow motion. In droughts, as Ag Force would be able to tell you, you will seek to manage and mitigate the impacts of the drought. You will destock, and there have been some good prices that been out there for stock and that can mitigate your losses. But in north-west Queensland, there were no opportunities for this. What happened in the space of 24 hours was to turn from hope to complete despair. As best as we can determine, half a million head just were washed away and are still dying today of pneumonia. So the ability to really build, what is a central part of Australia’s economy as well as our way of life, will take quite an effort. And it will take quite a long time. So that’s why after I return from north-west Queensland, I pulled together a Ministerial Taskforce. And from that taskforce we have agreed and decided to establish a Recovery Reconstruction Authority which will be headed up by Shane Stone, the former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, who knows more about northern Australia than I think most people. And knows it from the perspective of what happens on the ground, but also how to get the best out of how governments can respond. Shane bridges those two levels of knowledge and experience. He will report directly to me through his authority working with the Ministerial Taskforce, which will include the Agricultural Minister of course, and the Deputy Prime Minister and Linda, in her capacity of emergency management, the Assistant Treasurer and others, to ensure that the coordinated response we provide in north-west Queensland hits the mark.

So what’s the toolkit I’ll be giving to Shane Stone as he sets about rolling this support out? There are a number of parts to it. The first one is we’ve made announcements today that through the tax office: late payment fees, interest, all of these things, gone… gone. Everything we can do through the tax system to relieve the financial burden on farmers who have been affected by this natural and national disaster, will be waived and that will enable them to not have that immediate anxiety hanging over them, as they seek to deal with this crisis themselves. There’s a relief when it comes to how far management deposits and tax, and I won’t go into the precise details with you, it’s quite technical, but there’s a raft of measures the Assistant Treasurer has been able to put together - with the Treasurer - to enable the tax office to exercise its discretion to ensure that the tax burden that sits on these farmers is relived. And that goes through to very prompt payment where people are expecting bass credits. And so they can get that money out. We know that many of these farmers do have sums in their farm management deposits that they can access to actually help the rebuilding process and we want them to be able to do that without incurring the sorts of tax penalties they might otherwise incur. So that’s immediate relief and that’s on top of the $75,000 Category D assistance, which has been rolling out now for several weeks, for which we removed a lot of the bureaucratic burdens, which go normally through the disaster payments process.

The second part is to work with each and every station, to restructure as they see fit, as they wish to, their existing levels of debt. Now, that can be done through their existing banks and we will enter into arrangements to ensure that those banks will be able to provide and restructure existing loans at lower costs of clients with payment holidays for three years, lower rates of interest, which can help them restructure their debts to get them on a footing which doesn’t mean that that debt is going to hit them with cash flow issues over the next three years, and potentially beyond. But it has to be crafted for each and every station. And that’s what’s so important with the authority, is to ensure they can do that. Now where they don’t wish to do that with the bank or the bank is not providing an offer, which is suitable, then we’ll be able to provide the same assistance through the Regional Investment Corporation and the Australian Government will be in a position to step in through the RIC, to restructure those existing mortgages. I don’t suspect that will be the usual option, it’s there as a back-up option and there’s discussion we’ve had with the banks, then it’s quite likely that they may even be able to better the offer that might be able to be put in place by the RIC.

The second part is about restocking when it comes to debt. We will be providing grants to support the restocking of these stations. And that in turn will enable concessional loans to be provided, secured against the stock. Now, that will be possible through the banks because effectively we’re putting equity into stock as they’re being rebuilt. We will be providing those direct cash grants per head, which will mean that they balance can be borrowed against the stock and not against the property. When I was up in Cloncurry at the bowling club the other week that was one of the key issues that came across from the farmers. As we rebuild our stock, we need to be able to secure the debt against the stock, not against the farmer. There is just too much debt otherwise and it’ll hamper them from rebuilding.

So this is, I’d say, one of the biggest toolkits we’ve ever given anyone. To try and help rebuild what is an essential part of our economy, and in our Australian way of life in north Queensland. When I was stood in the town hall of Julia Creek I said we would deliver a significant package to help them get on their feet but you know it’s all about reconstruction. It’s all about rebuilding. It’s not about compensation. It’s about standing with each and every station. Each and every property. Each and every farmer. And working with their business to see them rebuild what they have lost. Now in speaking with them directly, I know how much they want to do that task but they know they need our help and I’m telling them through this package that help has arrived. And with Shane Stone reporting direct to me you’ll have someone who, through an authority, that will be agile and able to assist you as you form those plans to get back on your feet and they’ll be there with the package of measures that can help you realise your plans.

Now, I know that was a very long introduction, but as you can see there’s a very significant package that I’m announcing today and I believe it will do everything that is required to help north Queensland get back on its feet. But as further feedback comes through that process, knowing Shane as well as I do I believe he won’t hesitate to let me know. So Linda why don’t you talk more generally about emergency assistance…

ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS SENATOR THE HON LINDA REYNOLDS CSC: Thank you very much Prime Minister. First of all I’d say thank you for your very decisive and rapid leadership in this crisis response. Over the past month, I’ve had the privilege of leading the federal government’s emergency response in relation to all of these matters and I’ve seen the absolute best of all Australians in the most horrible of circumstances. And I just wanted to shout out, first of all, to everybody over the last month in this relief phase, who have everything from the ADF members who, despite the fact many of them have lost their own homes, have been out right across Queensland dropping fuel on fodder while leaving their own families to look after their house. From Centrelink staff who have been out and got $100 million into the pockets of people here in Townsville and right across the area. Through to the state agencies and of course the local shire councillors who’ve done an extraordinary job. And this has been... I think it is an unprecedentedly quick response to a disaster here. And my role has been to make sure that all of the Commonwealth agencies work with the state agencies and the local shires to get rid of all of the bureaucratic things that can sometimes hamper quick emergency responses. But now my role is transitioning as well from immediate relief to making sure that as the agency is stood up, under Shane Stone, that the Commonwealth departments work with state and local agencies to make sure we keep getting out the responses required. So we’ve got education responses, mental health and reconstruction tasks that we have to make sure that we keep getting right. So again thank you very much to everybody who has made this terrible disaster just that little bit easier to get through and start to stand up again. So thank you.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks, I’m going to ask Shane to just say a few words about how he is standing up the agency. And thanks very much Shane for taking this on…

SHANE STONE AC QC: Thank you Prime Minister…

PRIME MINISTER: You’re no stranger to a big job…

STONE: [laughs] A week ago I was having a quiet life and I thought I’d really done my last media conference a really long time ago. So all I can say is welcome back [laughs]. But as a former head of government I can make this observation. There is often a gap in between saying and doing. People have the very best of intentions and they make commitments and promises. But I just want to say about this Prime Minister, I mean we’re here, we’ve arrived, we’re set-up, we’re out in the field now and it’s happened every quickly, because this PM has not only been able to say, but he’s done. And it’s happened. And you don’t see it too often. And it’s given me the confidence to know that I do have the tools, I do have the authority. I have that direct line of communication, which is so fundamentally and essentially important when you hit log-jams, and you do hit log-jams, to make sure that we can be a part of a very effective reconstruction. It’s not about a hand-out, it’s about a hand-up. It’s about rebuilding the north. And it will take time. And it will be intergenerational in some cases. So Prime Minister, you made it happen.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks…

STONE: And Linda, and all the other ministers who were a part of that special grouping you put together. You didn’t mess around. You sat late into the night, you made the decisions that mattered to people. And we’re up and running. We’re away.

PRIME MINISTER: Fantastic. Now Ag force is here aren’t they?

GEORGIE SOMERSET, AG FORCE QUEENSLAND: Look from Ag Force Queensland’s perspective we thank you for being here Prime Minister. And thank you for this longer term announcement. The last few weeks have been spent just cleaning up the disaster and getting our heads around the size of it for the north-west beef industry and our communities. And this package gives us an opportunity to actually know that, there’s not… we don’t have to have it all sorted tomorrow. We’ve actually got time. And that Shane and the authority are actually going to work with the industry. Property by property, business by business, to work out what is the best solution. And we will endeavour through this process to actually create greater resilience and an even more profitable beef industry in north-west Queensland, because that is what the people out there want. We’re multigenerational farmers, who simply want to keep producing fantastic red meat for the rest of Australia and the world. And we will rebuild those industries through a package like this that can actually get livestock back. Get fences back up, get the livestock back. Keep our small business going and build our communities and bring the next generation forward. Many of our businesses have got three generations there currently and they’re looking for more generations of their families to be raised in north-west Queensland and work in that industry. So, at Ag Force we welcome the opportunity to work with you and to work with you Shane over the coming years, I suspect, to actually bed down what this will look like and how we actually help everyone in north-west Queensland recover.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you very much. Well the authority has not got a sunset provision, I should stress. It will be there for as long as it needs to be there, to do the job that it has and that job is pretty simple. We are going to rebuild, what was washed away here in north Queensland. Property by property, station by station, farm by farm, business by business, house by house. That’s what we’re committed to doing here and we’re committed to doing it not just now but for the long term. So I want to thank all of those who played a role. I particularly want to thank Minister Littleproud, David Littleproud, for the work he’s done as Ag minister. And Michael McCormack working with us so closely on the Ministerial Taskforce. So let’s take questions on everything we’ve announced today and then as usual, if there are other matters of the day, I’ll address that but I won’t burden others who are with us here, for this purpose, today, with those questions.

JOURNALIST: Mr Morrison, can you compel banks not to foreclose?

PRIME MINISTER: What we can do is ensure that if the banks aren’t prepared to do these things, then we can offer the same deal through the Regional Investment Corporation. But we can also do that as part of the underwriting agreement that we have to ensure that that is the terms by which they take that generic relationship with us. So in short, yes we can, where we’ve entered into an agreement on funding.

JOURNALIST: Can that be extended to farmers that are still in drought?

PRIME MINISTER: What we have to make really clear is that this is a very specific – and Ag Force might want to comment on this because we’ve had this discussion with national farmers – what we’re dealing with in North Western Queensland is quite unique. Quite unique. It’s very different, it was very sudden, and basically everything was washed away in a night. And so the ability to rebuild from that point is quite different. We will continue to work away on what we’re doing on drought assistance throughout the country. We’ve got a $5 billion drought fund which – and I don’t particularly want to make a partisan note on this, which the Labor Party voted against in the Parliament just last week, not to have a drought fund – amazing. But anyway, that’s for them to explain. So we will continue to provide that drought support and assistance in the many ways we’re doing that right around the country. One of the successful has been the work we’ve done with the $1 million per shire and on top of that, the on-farm water infrastructure which has been very important in helping those farmers and those towns actually survive through the drought. So I would say the two issues are quite separate because of the severity and the quite time-specific nature of the natural disaster and the national disaster that took place here.

JOURNALIST: Exactly how much money has been put aside for the reconstruction?

PRIME MINISTER: It’s open-ended. It’s open-ended. Because we still don’t know what the scale of the losses are. Station owners, farmers, still don’t know how much stock they’ve lost. We estimate in the vicinity of about 850 stations we will be able to support, that’s how many have come in. We’re not giving any money to multinationals or the big corporate farmers, they’re not part of this program. They have their own ways of dealing with their holdings and they’ll deal with that. This is the family farms and other ones and stations that have been there for many generations and we’re targeting them. So it isn’t… it is open-ended because it’s a process of rebuilding and what Shane’s Authority will be doing is literally going station by station with their own restocking, rebuilding plans and sitting down with them and the banks will be part of that discussion as well as how that can all be made to happen and the financing tools that will be made available under this package.

JOURNALIST: The Insurance Council has assessed the damage to be in the multi-millions of dollars, are you expecting you’ll be having to outlay that much money?

PRIME MINISTER: Well as I said, I’m not limiting it. Remember, the insurance estimates are based on different compensation responsibilities they have. See, what we’re doing is we’re part of the rebuilding process and insurance assessment is based on losses. What we’re doing is based on the rebuilding task and the rebuilding cost and that rebuilding cost will be the restocking of the country, the fences that are being put in place, the turkey nests that need to be cleaned, all of these sorts of things. And that business plan… I know these station owners will be drawing on their own resources to do that. I mean, some have tens of thousands in farm management deposits which they’ll be able to draw on and that will help them. The million dollars we’ve put into each of the shires has helped ensure that they can dispose of the thousands of carcasses that have been rotting on the ground as well as paying for the fodder drops that were so critical in those first couple of weeks.

JOURNALIST: You mention the interest rates and the loans will be [inaudible] done station by station, is there and amount you can say we can definitely reduce the [inaudible] amount they’re going to need?

PRIME MINISTER: No, it’s too early to say that. It will depend on what the existing financial arrangements are of each of those stations. You can’t take a cookie cutter approach to rebuilding North Queensland. Every station is different. I’ll give you an example. You go out to Gypsie Plains. They are right at the top of the breeding food chain, breeding stock food chain in Australia. It has taken them – Jacqueline, who has been out there with her husband – the last 37 years I think to get the herd to where it was before it was washed away and it dies of pneumonia on outcrops right across their property. And I saw where the carcasses lay. You can’t rebreed that stock in two years, that will take another generation to do that. In other places where they’re running a different type of herd, the turnaround can be a lot quicker. The price of what the sort of stock and cattle they will have to be getting on their property will be different to another. So I think we have to be careful not to assume you can just take a one size fits all approach to this. If you did that, you would do exactly as Shane said, you would rush to failure. And that’s why we’re taking a far more bespoke, customised approach to every single property.

JOURNALIST: As far as small business is concerned, I know that there have been some issues out west with businesses that weren’t physical affected by the flooding but there have been flow-on effects because there’s just no money in those communities. Will there be changes to the criteria for them?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes is the short answer. And that support now goes from $25,000 to $50,000 which is what I’ve announced today and particularly in those areas – and Shane’s Authority is going to help us with this – is working out how we can get rid of some of that red tape and bureaucracy and that was relayed directly to me in Julia Creek. But again, the impact in Julia Creek is different to what it is in Cloncurry it’s a more diverse economy, and then the other towns, whether it’s Huon or Richmond or the other places across the north-west. We’re just looking to be very, very specific to each town and each business.

JOURNALIST: Using stock as equity has been a long-time issue for graziers. Why is it now that we’re able to provide this to them?

PRIME MINISTER: This is the only way they’ll be able to restock. It’s the only way they can do it and that’s based on me sitting down directly with farmers and how they have hoped to achieve… we’re talking about people who have lost anywhere between 30 per cent and 90 per cent of their herd and their mortgages are already at a level where they just can’t go and borrow more money against their own property. If they want to restock – which they want to do desperately – to stay on the land and do what they’ve always done, they will need to secure these loans against their stock.

JOURNALIST: Even with their finance against the herd of cattle, there are still going to be graziers out there who can’t take on more debt. What assistance is available to them and could it be handouts?

PRIME MINISTER: Well there will be grants for stock and so that’s why I say it’s a combined approach. There’ll be grants for stock purchases, combined with concessional loans. And the grants for the stock basically put the equity in the stock which enables the banks to then loan against the stock. So this is… we’ve done our homework on this, we’ve thought through it very carefully. We’ve sat down with the banks themselves and worked out what we need to do, the wholesale funding costs, what we need to do on guarantees, what we need to do on equity to ensure that the whole package when Shane and his team come together and sit down with each station, how it can actually work for them.

JOURNALIST: Because the funding is so specific, in terms of eligibility, it’s for current and new agribusinesses, will there be a time limit on when they can apply for this?

PRIME MINISTER: No. As I said, this could take years. This could take years. And for many farmers, they’re still going through just the shock and the grief stage of what’s occurring in North Western Queensland. Some farmers haven’t even been able to return to their properties. Some have not, when I was there the other week, some have not ventured more than a few hundred metres from the homestead. For some days they couldn’t venture more than a few hundred metres from the homestead. So it’ll be done at their pace, it’ll be done with them and it will be done particularly with the local shire mayors and I really want to thank all of the local shire and council mayors all throughout North Western Queensland. They have done such a fantastic job leading their communities and they have been our touchstone for staying in contact with what was needed on the ground.

JOURNALIST: 850 stations, a personalised response for each of them. That’s a mammoth task.

PRIME MINISTER: It is.

JOURNALIST: Is more manpower going to be hired to do this or what’s the size of this?

PRIME MINISTER: Well Shane is standing up – it’s standing up right now – the Authority and he will get what he needs.

JOURNALIST: How much money are we putting to…

PRIME MINISTER: Well that actually is not the expensive part of this exercise. There are already numbers who have been seconded into this Authority as we speak, that’s already happened. We’ve already stood up and executive officer to work with Shane, they will have a presence here in Townsville and so the real challenge here is not finding the people to help do this, the challenge here is getting the stock and getting it purchased and getting the land in a position where that stock can get out on the pastures.

JOURNALIST: Are we going to be creating local jobs though as part of this Agency?

PRIME MINISTER: If we don’t rebuild the Queensland cattle industry, there won’t be jobs in North Queensland. And that’s why it’s so important and what we’ve done on drought, particularly through the things I mentioned before, all of that is being designed to keep the towns alive. Now some of the work that is done on the recovery side of this, as Linda knows, rebuilding some of those roads and rail links, that’s really important for the mining industry. And you know me, I support the resources industry in Queensland. My Government is very supportive of the mining and resources industry in Queensland. I can’t say the same for the Labor Party. Can’t say the same for Bill Shorten. But you’re working in a resources job in Queensland, you job is safe if I’m the Prime Minister.

JOURNALIST: Just back to the manpower of that agency though, will it be local people that will be running that or will it be positons from Canberra?

PRIME MINISTER: Oh it’s a combination of things. It’ll be a combination of things but what is needed is the expertise and the experience and we’re obviously going to need some good local knowledge as well on the ground. So I’m not going to prejudice that, I’ll leave that up to Shane and his agency to make those calls.

JOURNALIST: Can you touch a bit on the mental health side of this announcement? $2.6 million.

PRIME MINISTER: The most important part of this is the Telehealth element under Medicare. One of the real challenges in delivering mental health services in rural Australia is… you know, these are tough people and they don’t often come forward. And so we need to make sure we can deliver the mental health services in the most agile, flexible, targeted way we possibly can. And that’s why a lot of resources going to the Telehealth side of delivering mental health resources into the community. And that’s proven to be effective in many other places. And that includes, you know, last year I announced money for HeadSpace to do exactly the same thing for young people. All the young people affected by this, people who are working on properties and stations and wondering about their future. But what I’m saying to everybody who is involved in the livestock industry in North Queensland is we are going to rebuild. I want to see it back where it was and I want to see that as soon as we can. It could take five years, it could take ten years. But I tell you what, we are going to get there with the package of measures we’ve announced today.

JOURNALIST: There’s damaging speculation Steve Ciobo and Christopher Pyne might be retiring at the next election. Have you spoken to them since this speculation has arised and can you quash this rumour?

PRIME MINISTER: I speak to them all the time.

JOURNALIST: Have you asked Steve Ciobo to delay his announcement til tomorrow?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I talk to them all the time.

JOURNALIST: There is speculation that he’s going to be filling an overseas posting?

PRIME MINISTER: There’s a lot of speculation going on, isn’t there?

JOURNALIST: Don’t you think this is damaging for you, so close to the election though?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

JOURNALIST: Do they just not want to sit in Opposition?

PRIME MINISTER: Well you’re speculating so you wouldn’t expect me to respond to speculation.

JOURNALIST: Is it a reflection though that those inside your own Party don’t think you can win?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

JOURNALIST: Can I talk about the Pipeline?

PRIME MINISTER: Sure.

JOURNALIST: There is a window of time where if we build the station pipleline we can have $55 million worth of savings. Is that window closing considering the project planned tender…

PRIME MINISTER: Well we’ve been moving forward on it. George, did you want to make a comment on the pipeline?

GEORGE CHRISTENSEN, MEMBER FOR DAWSON: I could. Look, the announcement that the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister made in regards to the second stage of the Townsville Water Pipeline is one that is the right thing. Obviously, you need to do the project planning to get it right. Not just the expenditure of taxpayers dollars but also the ongoing operational costs which Townsville ratepayers are going to have to wear. And we want to make sure that the pipeline is done in a way that the ongoing operating costs and replacement costs aren’t going to pose too big of a burden on ratepayers. Having said that, the company that has been awarded the tender has a local presence already, it’s very good to see. It’s not going to be just out-of-towners coming in telling Townsville people what to do, it’s going to be a reference panel. The stakeholders, I’m advised by the Deputy Prime Minister today, from the Waterford Townsville Action Group that’ll be part of a stakeholder panel associated with this project as well. But ultimately, they are tasked by the Government with ensuring that if there are cost savings to be made, that they must act quickly to enable those cost savings to be made. So that is a standing order from the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister and it’ll happen.

JOURNALIST: What’s your reaction to news that Benjamin Netanyahu looks likely to be indicted on corruption?

PRIME MINISTER: My reaction would be not to sort of comment on matters that don’t directly relate to Australia’s relationship and we enjoy an outstanding relationship with the nation of Israel. And particularly my Government has demonstrated a support for Israel surpassing all previous governments. And I had the opportunity to speak on that in the Parliament recently and was grateful for the very kind responses I received both from the government of Israel and their Ambassador here in Australia. But also the many thousands of Australians of Jewish descent and Jewish faith. We are a proud and upstanding friend of Israel and always will be. We won’t be walking back from our relationship with Israel and our recognition of Israel. But it would seem the Labor Party is crab walking away from that. OK, thank you.PRESS CONFERENCE - SYDNEY, NSW

ABC Chair recommendation; John Kennerley; Nauru; ISIS fighters; Richard Boyle; George Pell
PRIME MINISTER: Well, thank you for coming together this morning. I'm pleased to announce that I'll be recommending to the Governor-General that Ms Ita Buttrose be appointed the next chair of the ABC. The ABC plays an extremely important role in Australian life and has done for generations. It's an important Australian institution and we have seen that time and again and most recently we have seen that in the fires and the floods that have once again ravaged our nation over the summer period. It's the ABC that those who have been stricken by those disasters have turned to in their times of need to get the information and reliable news services that they have needed to cope with these debilitating disasters. But that's not the only role, of course, that the ABC plays. It plays a pervasive role throughout Australian life from our youngest to our oldest. All across the generations. And we have all had our own direct association and wonderful stories that we can tell about the ABC. So when you ask someone to take on the role as chair of the ABC, it needs to be someone you know to be trusted with that important institution. And in asking Ms Buttrose to take on this role, that's exactly who I believe we have been able to find. I'm very appreciative of her willingness to take on this role. Ita, as we know, I hope she doesn't mind me being informal…

ITA BUTTROSE: Not at all.

PRIME MINISTER: …has the strength, the integrity and the fierce independence that she is known for to take stewardship of this important Australian institution. But it is not just her extensive experience in publishing and broadcasting which equips her for this role as we know. As a former Australian of the Year, Ita's experience, whether it comes to her support for causes like Alzheimer's, arthritis, AIDS, the Smith Family, the arts, the environment, these are all issues over her professional roles both in broadcasting and journalism as well as her roles outside of those undertakings, she's demonstrated a passion, a deep knowledge and empathy for very much in line, I think, with the views and the wishes and concerns of Australians. But the other thing that I think really sets Ita apart is this: The reason she has been so successful - in publishing, in broadcasting, is she has always put her viewers, her listeners and her readers first. And you know what? That's what the ABC needs to do too. It's about their viewers, it's about their listeners, it's about their readers, and the services they provide to Australians. And in Ms Buttrose we have someone who has demonstrated throughout her career that the best way to run a broadcasting and publishing organisation is to focus on the people for whom it's for - which is the readers and the viewers, and the listeners to the ABC. Australians trust Ita. I trust Ita. And that's why I have asked her to take on this role and I'm absolutely thrilled that she has accepted our ask to take on that role and I want to congratulate her on her pending appointment obviously subject to the Governor-General and those processes we followed in the normal way. Thank you very much, Ita. I'm going to ask the Minister to make a few comments and then we'll ask Ms Buttrose to make a few.

SENATOR THE HON MITCH FIFIELD, MINISTER FOR COMMUNCATIONS AND THE ARTS: Thank you, Prime Minister. The ABC is an important cultural organisation. It is one of the important underpinnings of media diversity in Australia. It represents a significant Commonwealth contribution to civic journalism. The ABC informs us, it entertains us, it's close to the community particularly in rural and regional Australia and despite some difficulties, this important work has continued. Ita Buttrose is uniquely qualified to chair the ABC. She has worked in every form of media. She has worked as a journalist, she's worked in management, she's worked as an editor. Ita Buttrose is someone that Australians know, she's someone that Australians trust. Ita is the right person to chair the ABC at this time and, Ita, can I wish you well and congratulate you as well.

ITA BUTTROSE: Thank you so much. Thank you.

PRIME MINISTER: Chair-designate?

ITA BUTTROSE: Thank you for those kind words, Prime Minister and Mitch Fifield. I am very honoured to have been asked to chair the ABC. I consider it one of the most important cultural and information organisations in our country and I'm - I'm honoured to be asked to lead it into the future. It is a voice of the Australian people, I think it reflects our identity, it tells our stories, it tells our stories not just here in Australia but to the rest of the world, and I have grown up with the ABC. I'm a devoted listener to the ABC. I start my day with ABC news radio - I don't leave home without it, I’ve got the App on my phone. My father worked at the ABC for a number of years and when he retired, he was assistant general manager. So, I do know the culture at the ABC particularly well and I wish my dad was still alive to see me here today but he's not. So I'm a passionate believer in the independence of the ABC. And I will do everything in my utmost power to make sure it remains that way.


PRIME MINISTER: Thank you very much Ita, Let's take some questions on this matter. As usual I know there’ll be other questions on political matters of the day and given the fierce independence of the ABC, I won't impose on the chair-designate to be here for those questions and you might excuse Ita at that point. Yes?

JOURNALIST: Can I just ask Prime Minister why was there spending, why has the government spent money on recruiters and head hunters, if only the government has really gone against their advice with this appointment?

PRIME MINISTER: Well the Labor Party put in place a process when they were in government which was this independent process of the Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet appointing a panel. And that panel undertakes that process at complete arm's lengths from the government. I have no involvement in it, the Minister has no involvement in it. They appoint the recruiters who are involved and provide the terms for those recruiters. So, the Labor Party set up a process, we have followed that process, but where I don't believe that process actually meets the requirements, then the government of the day has the ability to make the right appointment and that's what I have done today.

JOURNALIST: Ita, you have worked for Kerry Packer as a boss. You know you'll be working for the Australian public as your boss. Which do you think is the more terrifying prospect? 

[Laughter]

ITA BUTTROSE: I don't have a problem with the Australian public. I believe the main shareholders of the ABC are the Australian public. I have always had a very good communication with them and I think through the ABC we'll be able to continue that conversation. The ABC does it very well. It does it much better than the commercial networks.

JOURNALIST: What do you think is the biggest challenge facing the ABC at the moment?

ITA BUTTROSE: I think the most important - and in my role as chair, I think my most important role is to restore stability to the management of the organisation, to reassure the staff that life will go on as usual and to reassure the board who has also been through a period of unrest that, you know, it's time to get - it's time to get the ABC functioning again with proper stable management and good frank discussion between the chair and whoever is the managing director. If there's not a close relationship between the chair and the managing director, you cannot make an organisation work efficiently and well.

JOURNALIST: Ita, did you apply for the role when it became available and if not why not?

ITA BUTTROSE: No, I didn't.

JOURNALIST: Why didn't you?

ITA BUTTROSE: Well, I just didn't. Maybe that was a mistake on my part, but I just didn't do it.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you said on Monday that you knew Ita for years, is this a captain’s pick and can you assure the public that you won't be leaning on that relationship when it comes to matters of editorial and you will go through the formal complaints process?

PRIME MINISTER: That's the process I have always followed by the way. And from time to time I have had my complaints with the editors and I have dealt with them through those processes and I have been able to find some satisfaction in how those processes are followed. It hasn't been uncommon for the ABC to actually issue apologies to me in the past on air, in fact, and so I followed those processes and always will continue to. I respect the independence of the ABC as our Government always has, and in the new chair-designate, I know there will be a fiercely independent chair and who, I think, commands great respect for the Australian people when it comes to the integrity of the journalistic process. And that means getting facts right. It means getting things right and that's why I have great confidence in making this recommendation to the Governor-General. So, you know, we'll continue to follow that Process and I was very pleased to invite Ita to consider this role earlier this year and I'm thrilled that she's taken up the challenge.

JOURNALIST: Ita, do you believe the ABC requires more funding to fulfil its commitments to the Australian people?

ITA BUTTROSE: I haven't been through the accounts yet. I haven't discussed anything with the acting managing director or with the acting chair. And I need to look at those things. I need to look at those figures and see what's what. I'm aware what the current funding is, but, look, let me assure you that if I think there is a need for more funding, I won't be frightened to ask for it.

JOURNALIST: With the acting managing director, one of the key jobs of the chair is to find a CEO who is going to be running it. How does that process go? Does the acting managing director already have the inside track on that or is it generally an open field in your mind?

ITA BUTTROSE: Well it would be an open field. I mean, I know that the acting managing director has applied and his hast is in the ring, but the applications for the managing director role do not close until tomorrow, March 1, yeah, tomorrow. And so, therefore we'll have to look at the acting managing director's credentials in line with all the other people that have applied. I'm assuming there are quite a few.

JOURNALIST: Is there a leaning to keep someone internal given Mr Anderson’s long experience at the ABC?

ITA BUTTROSE: I have not had that discussion with anyone.

JOURNALIST: And Ita, In terms of your digital experience, some people say you haven't been a full time media executive for a while, what’s your knowledge of how the landscape has changed for media companies given Facebook and Google's dominance?

ITA BUTTROSE: Well, I think anyone working in the media knows the impact that digital has had on all our operations in whatever line field, whatever line of media work we're in. And I think it's - I actually think it's improved, opened so many new doors for all of us, things we can now do that we couldn't do before, that the fact that we can have instant communication is something that's really excited me. When I started as a very young journalist, it used to take 40 hours to fly film out from London before we even knew if we had a decent shot. Look at what we can do now. I think I have never been frightened of what technology offers to us in the media. It is the way of the future. We all know that. And the ABC has a part of that and it's already working very hard in this field and I don't intend that it shouldn't keep doing so. We have a right to be there. It is the way of the future and the ABC must have that future.

JOURNALIST: There is a loud view by some of the community that the ABC is a nest of left-wing vipers in terms of its journalism that it doesn't represent - I see nods and smiles from the Prime Minister.

PRIME MINISTER: I'm just amused.

JOURNALIST: What is your take on it?

ITA BUTTROSE: 80 per cent of Australian’s say we're unbiased. 80 per cent of Australians say that they trust our news more than they trust any other kind of information. So we must be doing something right. But look, there's always room for improvement.

JOURNALIST: If you had a politician or someone from the Prime Minister's office make contact with you about a journalist or a story or something of that nature, how would you handle an issue like that?

ITA BUTTROSE: I'd listen and I want you to know that, you know, I'm sure - it's not only the ABC that gets complaints from politicians. I have copped plenty of complaints from politicians in previous roles especially when I was editor-in- chief in News Limited.

JOURNALIST: Do you think we need to you do away with the independent panel process, if they are not providing us with the most qualified candidate?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I'm not proposing that. But what I can assure you is that all the processes of the Act have been followed. You asked about the process through cabinet as well. It followed the normal cabinet process. It went to cabinet. It's my responsibility as Prime Minister to put forward a nomination to cabinet which I did and that was enthusiastically supported earlier this week and to work with the Minister for Communications in that process in the department. All of those processes were followed. I think that's the important point. And when you follow all the important processes and you make decisions having followed those processes, which is what we have done, which leaves open where I feel that the recommendations that were made to me, if in my view and the government's view, don't meet the standard or the requirement that we have, then we're at liberty to make a further nomination which we have and we'll be doing that to the Governor-General. We will table our reasons for doing so in the Parliament in the normal process which is required under the Act. So the processes have been followed. That's including the requirements for official consultation with the Leader of the Opposition which was done earlier today.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you said in your opening remarks that we all have a wonderful story to tell about the ABC. What's the wonderful story you have got to tell about the ABC?

PRIME MINISTER: Behind The News. I remember it as a kid and that's where I started getting my first current affairs reporting from - was Behind The News. And it was a bit different back then than what it is today, but - the fact it's still there, I think is great.

JOURNALIST: Has there been nothing since then?

PRIME MINISTER: No, there has been a lot since then, obviously. I always understand in all the roles that I have had, the importance of, you know, appearing on the flagship interview programs on the ABC. I have never been a stranger to those whether it's the 7.30 or Insiders in the past or most recently AM, all of these. I mean they play an important role. I have always treated those with the respect they have earned and their presenters as well. And I have dealt with many of those presenters and they're always a gruelling and tough interview, I have got to say. And that's as it should be and I think as leaders we - we are in a position to having to put ourselves forward for that as indeed we are here today. So look, there are more, Hugh and we'll have a coffee one day and I'll share more with you. But the one - perhaps the first engagement is always the sweetest and that was Behind The News all those years ago.

JOURNALIST: Ita, do you consider one of the main responsibilities of your role now to rebuild trust from the public after the Michelle Guthrie, Justine Milne situation?

ITA BUTTROSE: I don't - I don't think the public has really lost trust in the ABC. You know, I think the - you know, I think the ABC occupies a very special place in the hearts and minds of Australians. The Michelle Guthrie matter is something else again. It's a management issue. It's being dealt with. It's still in mediation and I'm not sure how that's going to end yet.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you conveyed or communicated or spoken to Ita about any concerns or thoughts or improvements that could be made to the ABC?

PRIME MINISTER: I can assure you that any conversations I have with the chair-designate on these matters will always remain between the Chair’s designate and indeed the Chair and I. If I have any formal issues that I need to raise with the ABC, then there are appropriate channels for doing that.

JOURNALIST When do you expect the Governor-General to sign off or to give (inaudible) on this?

PRIME MINISTER: That should be in place next week.

JOURNALIST: And when do you intend to start working at the ABC as the Chair?

ITA BUTTROSE: I've already had a text message from the Acting Chair, so I would think not long after I leave here, I will give her a call.

JOURNALIST Ita, what’s the best piece of reporting you have seen?

ITA BUTTROSE: I'm sorry?

JOURNALIST What's the best piece of reporting that you have seen from the ABC recently?

ITA BUTTROSE: Oh there are so many. I'm a big fan of Leigh Sales and the 7.30 report, I think it consistently breaks stories, it gives you views on the world. Four Corners is without doubt the leading investigative program in Australia. ABC news radio consistently breaks stories. ABC News Breakfast, the TV show, is a good little show and its doing lots of great work there, there’s so many parts of the ABC that are breaking news and again, they’re stories we wouldn't get on commercial networks.

JOURNALIST Is the Project Jetstream dead?

ITA BUTTROSE: I have read about it, of course, but I need to have that discussion with the board and the Managing Director and we haven't had that yet, so I can't really comment on it.

PRIME MINISTER: Any more questions on this issue before we move on?

JOURNALIST: Your good friend Kerri-Anne Kennerley, you might be aware she suffered the loss of her husband this morning.

ITA BUTTROSE: Look I did just hear the very sad news that Kerri-Anne’s husband John died. And I am really to sorry to hear it because I liked them very much.​

PRIME MINISTER: Can I also pass on my best wishes to Kerri-Anne as well. We, Ita and I just heard about that before we came here. 

ITA BUTTROSE: They were a great couple and she adored him. 

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah. That is a true love story, a love story that shows how lucky we are to have people who we love in our lives and I'm sure Kerri-Anne will be deeply comforted by that relationship over such a long period of time and I'm sure she will get enormous waves of comfort and support from the Australian people. They shared their story openly with the Australian public and they let people into a very private part of their lives and I think the strength and determination, care and compassion that was shown in that relationship was an encouragement to all Australians. We love you, Kerry-Anne and we just hope that these days and weeks ahead are not too arduous, but we know they will be, and you have the love and care of the nation with you. So with that, we might thank Ita again and we will get on to the other matters of the day. Thank you. 

ITA BUTTROSE: Thank you very much everybody.

PRIME MINISTER: Can I also thank the acting chair Kirstin Ferguson for the role she’s been performing since taking on the role of acting chair, and she’ll obviously be engaging with the chair-designate as we move through that next phase and after those events of last year that required quite a bit of skill and experience to ensure that the ABC could get back to what they need to focus on, and that, I think, has occurred and I want to thank Kirstin on what she has done, I'm sure Mitch would, too.

SENATOR THE HON MITCH FIFIELD, MINISTER FOR COMMUNCATIONS AND THE ARTS: Yes, I thank Dr Kirstin Ferguson for her work as acting chair. She is a substantive deputy chair and she will continue in that role, but in what has been a difficult time for the ABC, Dr Ferguson has led the organisation well.

PRIME MINISTER: On other matters today, as you know, the last four remaining children who are on Nauru at the regional processing location - of course, they hadn't been in detention for quite a period of time, they were living on Nauru - they have been transferred to the United States and that means there are no longer any children on Nauru at the regional processing location. There were no children on Manus Island, it was the former government that put children on Manus Island in an inexplicable decision to that that in the first instance. That was rectified a long time ago.

And so I am very pleased that were are in a position now to say that has been achieved and the only way you can ensure that children don’t go back on Nauru is to ensure that your border protection regime is not compromised and that you do not allow vessels to legally enter Australia with children on board. And the only way you can do that is maintain the strength of our border protection regime. That’s what our Government is doing and that’s what Bill Shorten and the Labor Party demonstrated they do not have the ability or conviction or determination to do. They will just blow over in a hair’s breadth, whether it’s in the people smugglers or indeed from other sections of the community which would have them undermine our border protection. 

JOURNALIST: Is the Government interested in pursuing prosecution in relation to the Jihadi bride that has fled Syria?

PRIME MINISTER: This will be a very complex case and Australia will make decisions consistent with our national security interests. Obviously the issue of the children involved is also a very sensitive one. The children can’t be held responsible for the crimes of their parents. They are in a very dangerous part of the world and Australia is not in a position to offer any safe passage for people who are in that part of the world. And that is very concerning for the fact that there are children involved in this and their parents, Khaled Sharrouf in particular who committed despicable crimes, have placed their children in harm’s way. So look, we will deal with that issue sensitively but we must remember that both parents, including Khaled Sharrouf’s wife, committed crimes being where they were and doing what they were doing.

JOURNALIST: On another matter, there’s a case involving an ATO tax office whistleblower Richard Boyle is processing through. It’s been reported that he faces potentially six life sentences for breaching privacy rules and informational laws that are based around his role formerly in the ATO. Do you have any concerns about the circumstance in which a public servant who has revealed problems with the practices of the tax office faces more time in jail, theoretically, than a mass murderer?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I’m not familiar with the circumstances of that case, Hugh, so I can’t really comment.

JOURNALIST: With Cardinal Pell, former Prime Minister John Howard wrote a reference to him at his sentence hearing. Many of his supporters believe his claim that he is innocent of these crimes. What do you think, Prime Minister?

PRIME MINISTER: Well Australians, whether they’re former Prime Ministers or not, have every right to express the views that they have. What I have said about this issue is my thoughts remain with all victims of institutional child sexual abuse. Having, as I said yesterday, led the national apology following the Royal Commission – which I must say, Hugh, is one of I think the outstanding achievements of the ABC in the way that they addressed that issue of institutional child sexual abuse – my thoughts are with them. Because all of this will be stirring up all of those most horrific and painful of experiences they endured. And to be honest, that’s what I’m particularly focused on at the moment in my concern for them and how they’re processing all of this. Having met so many of them through the process of the apology, it just… it really just makes my heart terribly sad to know the pain they will be feeling today. It just… they just relive it all, and it’s just horrendous. So to be honest, I’m more concerned about that.

LIBERAL CANDIDATE FOR LYONS JESSICA WHELAN: Hi, I’m Jessica Whelan, the Liberal federal candidate for Lyons. I’m here today with my colleagues Senator Barnett and Minister Price. We’re excited today to have Premier Will Hodgman with us and, once again, Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Welcome.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you very much. We’re in your state, Will.

THE HON WILL HODGMAN MP, PREMIER OF TASMANIA: I’m thrilled to again be welcoming the Prime Minister and Minister Angus Taylor and Minister Price back to Tasmania and also to be here with our other federal colleagues, especially my Minister for Energy, Guy Barnett, and local member Leonie Hiscutt, and to be really making a very strong announcement, not only about Tasmania’s great competitive strength, that is renewable energy, but also the potential for Tasmania to be the nation’s battery, the renewable energy battery.

I want to also take the opportunity to acknowledge the team from Hydro Tasmania. When I talk about our great competitive strengths, there’s no better example of expertise and passion and commitment for our state and its energy sector than the team from Hydro. They’ve been working very hard on these projects for a number of years, so I want to acknowledge that effort.



PRIME MINISTER: Thanks, Will. It’s great to be here with Premier Hodgman in the turnaround state and again I commend the Premier and all of his ministers on the great job they have done in really turning around the Tasmanian economy. I also want to pay my tribute to Hydro Tasmania. This is not my first time to one of these facilities in Tasmania, let alone elsewhere in the country, but I am always completely overwhelmed by the scale of the vision that was put in place to see these assets built in the first place. It is really quite extraordinary. For those watching on at the moment, the road in here is quite windy and to think all those years ago when this was done 50 years ago and these incredible assets were built for future generations, what that speaks to is that what we’re doing here today is also intergenerational in the same way that the decisions were taken by those over 50 years ago and more to see this realised. What the Premier and I are doing here today with ministers is saying this is the next phase of that grand vision. Today, what we’re announcing is $86 million which is being invested in getting us to a final investment decision for MarinusLink, the interconnector between Tasmania and the mainland, and the working up of the Battery of the Nation feasibility program.

Yesterday, I stood at Snowy Hydro and we were able to announce a final investment decision on that project. That’s what this process we’re starting today is going to take us toward and the same way yesterday we followed through on the important feasibility work we did on Snowy 2.0. It is our absolute commitment to follow through on the feasibility work we’re now doing here as part of this Battery of the Nation project, which linked together with the interconnector makes all of this work.

So what does all this mean? So what does all this mean? We’re about sustainable and reliable jobs. That’s going to be generated here by stable and reliable power, which is delivered through the Battery of the Nation project.Some 3,700 jobs will be created in Tasmania and in Victoria as a result of the projects that we’re commencing the process of today. Some $7 billion of economic impact out over the medium term and beyond will be generated as a result of the decisions that we’re taking today to start this program. This is exciting.

The other thing it does is it delivers as part of our sustainable plan to meet our emissions reductions targets and ensures the renewable power revolution that has been going in Australia over recent years is able to be maintained through the firming power support that comes out of projects like this. Projects like this reinforce the investment that has already been made in renewable power across Australia and makes it possible by providing the reliability component which gets prices down and makes sure the lights stay on. We understand the need to address all of these issues, but I’ve got to tell you, and I know Jessica Whelan will be particularly excited about this, it’s the jobs here for Tasmania – the real jobs in these real industries that are created here in Tasmania that make us most excited here in Tasmania. It’s a huge economic dividend and it’s something that our governments have been working together on and will continue to work on into the future so we realise the economic goals. We get the economic harvest, we get the jobs harvest, we get the energy harvest and we get the renewable and the sustainable energy harvest that delivers on our environmental commitments.

This is a win-win project all the way round. I want to thank all of those who have been involved in it and on that note, I’m going to pass now to Angus Taylor, our federal energy minister, and Guy Barnett, the state energy minister, who will talk a bit more about the projects and I’m going to ask Minister Price to talk about what all this means for our credible and sensible plan to reduce our emissions and to meet out 2030 target which I outlined on Monday. I’m going to hand over to Angus.

THE HON ANGUS TAYLOR MP, MINISTER FOR ENERGY: Thank you, Prime Minister. It’s wonderful to be here with Melissa Price, my federal colleague, and of course my state colleagues, on a project that’s had an enormous amount of work to get to this point – more work to get to a final investment decision but after yesterday, I’m very confident that great projects like this can succeed because we are backing great hydro projects. It’s particularly good to be getting around a project like this because you get to go to absolutely beautiful locations, so thank you for having us here today.

We are absolutely focused on driving down electricity prices while we keep the lights on and meet our international emissions obligations. That is exactly what these projects, Marinus and Battery of the Nation, can deliver. We face a real opportunity and challenge in our electricity markets right now. We’re seeing unprecedented investment in solar and wind – absolutely unprecedented. There will be a 250 per cent increase or more in the next three years in the renewable energy from solar and wind coming into our electricity market. 250 per cent increase. That is great for driving down emissions and it’s why in our electricity market we’ll reach our 26 per cent obligations in a few short years in the early 2020s. But it does create a challenge. That challenge is to make sure that when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine, we can still flick the switch and the lights go on – that the wheels of industry keep turning when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine. And that means we’ve got to have backup and storage. That’s exactly what Battery of the National and Marinus can deliver to Australia. We have seen what happens when state governments fail to have that basic insight to see that you need that backup when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow. In Victoria, when 200,000 houses lost their lights only a few short weeks ago, as well as the Portland aluminium smelter having to go offline. We’ve seen the same damage done in South Australia by a South Australian Labor government and we don’t want to see Bill Shorten taking that failed experiment national. What we are going to do is make sure there’s the backup there for those investments and make sure we do have the storage necessary to keep the lights on when we need it. That’s exactly what these projects are doing.

I want to make a short comment about jobs. I grew up in a hydro town. When you have great projects like this, you create jobs and regional jobs that are great jobs. You bring great people into the area. You give jobs to people who are in the area and I think for Tasmania and regional Tasmania and northern Tasmania, this is a fantastic project. I have seen with my own eyes the impact it can have. Great countries and great organisations build from the strengths of their past into a vision for the future. That is exactly what this project is doing. Again, congratulations to the hard work that’s been done to get it to this point.

THE HON GUY BARNETT MP, TASMANIAN MINISTER FOR ENERGY: Thanks very much, Prime Minister. It’s great to have you here in Tasmania and to Angus Taylor, my counterpart, Melissa Price, Premier and colleagues. It’s a very special day and an historic day for Tasmania and the nation. The combination of the MarinusLink with Battery of the Nation and the renewable energy developments that can flow as a result will deliver billions of dollars, thousands of jobs and downward pressure on electricity prices. Of course, in Tasmania, improved energy security. In terms of jobs, it’s in regional and rural Tasmania. We are very proud of that fact and it’s really important. Today the Tasmanian Government is confirming and announcing up to $30 million will be expended on the feasibility of the top three pumped hydro sites in Tasmania. Those locations will be identified in the very near future. That process will take up to 18 months and we want to thank, on behalf of the Tasmania Government, the Australian Government’s commitment, the Morrison Government’s commitment to underwriting that new generation investment in Tasmania. To identify that pumped hydro site, that process will continue. We’ll continue to collaborate and work with the Australian Government and we thank them for their commitment to commit further and work with the Tasmanian Government and, specifically, with Hydro Tasmania.

Here we are at Lake Cethana. It is a fantastic location and it’s one of those possible sites that will be considered and there are many in the Mersey-Forth Valley. This is a great location and I just want to pay tribute, as the Prime Minister did, to our forefathers for the vision that they demonstrated. In this case, 50 years ago, but across the 30 hydro power stations across the state of Tasmania, thank you to those visionaries that put in place those assets that we are now benefitting from. Today’s historic decision, we believe we will have more confidence than ever before that we’ll deliver not just for Tasmania, but for the nation low cost, reliable and clean energy which will provide that energy security that we all need.

THE HON MELISSA PRICE MP, MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT: Thank you. It’s great to be here with my federal and state colleagues. This has been an excellent week for the environment. Together with the Prime Minister, we announced our $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package. We’ve committed another $2 billion to our Emissions Reduction Fund and yesterday as part of our trip to have another look at the Snowy Hydro Project, a commitment of $1.4 billion.

We are a government that is committed to ensuring we meet our international emissions obligations. We’re also a government that’s committed to rural and regional jobs. As someone who represents the largest electorate in Australia, Durack, I know what good jobs mean to people in regional areas and so this is a great outcome for the people of Lyons and also more broadly for Tasmania. We know that the emissions reduction we will get from a fabulous project like this is around 25 million tonnes. That will help us meet our international obligations. We’re committed to ensuring that renewables are supported and that we have dispatchable power when we need it. When we turn on the lights, we need to know they’re going to come on. Thanks very much for being here.

PRIME MINISTER: Happy to take questions on this project and then deal with other matters if you would like to move to those as well. Let’s deal with the project first.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you biting off more than you can chew by pursuing both this and Snowy 2.0?

PRIME MINISTER: No, not at all. What we’re demonstrating here, and you would have seen yesterday, is that we’re going through a very methodical process. We began the Snowy 2.0 process over two years ago, and that included the Commonwealth actually fully taking out the purchase of Snowy 2.0 and then putting in place a very disciplined feasibility process. As I commented yesterday, it wasn’t just a couple of people roaming around in a ute and pointing at things, they did serious bore drilling and so on to work out what the real cost of that project was going to be. That’s the process we’re now going to go through here on these projects. The MarinusLink project and the Battery of the Nation Project, they have to go together. It is about the Battery of the Nation and Tasmania sending that power across Bass Strait. Currently, we have 400 megawatts which is just sitting idle out of Tasmania which would have been very useful in Victoria recently when they had the lights go out on so many homes. It is a disciplined and a very measured process we’re engaged in. It’ll be several years before we get to the position here that we arrived at yesterday in Snowy 2.0 and so these are projects where we’re looking well ahead and doing what we need to do now to be able to make the right decisions and how we can make them reality.

JOURNALIST: You’re all speaking as if this is definitely going to happen. Are you pre-judging the outcome?

PRIME MINISTER: I’m very confident about the outcome, I’ve got it say. Angus, you might want to speak to this, but as we’ve been through the Snowy 2.0 exercise, I think it has only highlighted, and there are other projects we’ve been involved with to, which is demonstrating that as you’re energy market continues to transition toward renewables, if you don’t have projects like this, then you lose the value of a lot of those renewables. In fact, you’d get a lot of dumping of generated electricity out of the renewable sector which can’t be accommodated in your market. If you want to have a renewables future, you’ve got to have big batteries like this and the commercial element of that is quite compelling and that’s what the numbers so far have shown. Of course, we’ll go through the numbers and only be led by the numbers, ultimately as we were on the Snowy. Mathias Cormann and Angus Taylor really put Snowy through their paces on this, as we will on these projects. But I’ve got to say, it’s looking good.

JOURNALIST: So in that case, how are you going to finance the up to $3 billion cost for the MarinusLink?

PRIME MINISTER: It’d be a commercial project and a commercial project means it can support its finance. That’s how any commercial project works. Angus, did you want to comment on it?

THE HON ANGUS TAYLOR MP, MINISTER FOR ENERGY: As I said earlier, we are seeing absolutely record investments in solar and wind – household solar as well as large scale solar and windfarms. They must be backed up and we must have storage. If we don’t, the lights go off and industry stops. Projects like this aren’t nice to have, they are necessary to have. We must have them. That’s why we see such potential in these projects. We stand ready to finance them. We demonstrated that yesterday. We demonstrated exactly that yesterday. They are good projects commercially, but they need government involvement and that’s why we will play a role if the numbers stack up. But I’ve got to say, given the environment we face, there is every, more than every chance that the numbers will stack up on this project.

JOURNALIST: Just to clarify – this $86 million – that’s new funds?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes. There’s $56 million from the Commonwealth which is going specifically on the Marinus Project and $30 million from the state government specifically on the three projects Guy Barnett outlined.

JOURNALIST: Would we expect to see physical work start on a second interconnector in your next term of government?

PRIME MINISTER: That very much depends on the process we’re now engaged in and the first one is a 600 connector and the potential to go to 1,200 as well. The project will look at both of those. The timetable will be very much a focus of those works and we want to see it happen as soon as possible. It could be as late as 2025 before we saw something there, but it could be earlier. I’m not going to pre-judge that. The point is to get it happening as soon as possible, but to make sure it’s being done on commercial basis. So what does that mean when I say it’s on a commercial basis? It means it can pay for itself. It means it can actually generate the revenues that actually support its financing. Yesterday, we made an equity investment in Snowy 2.0. We could have down that in many different ways. We could have done it by not taking dividends and the dividends could have been reinvested in the company. We chose a different path. Either way, it required that equity investment from the shareholder, which was the Commonwealth, and we’ll be looking at the innovative ways that the battery project and the Marinus project can be established working together with Hydro Tasmania.

JOURNALIST: The current Bass link is unreliable. We still don’t have an explanation for why it’s failed twice in recent years, so could that fail again and we’re left with just one interconnector after you’ve spent $3 billion and we’re back to one?

THE HON GUY BARNETT MP, TASMANIAN MINISTER FOR ENERGY: Thanks very much and I’m happy to respond to that. This plan for MarinusLink will, of course, increase and improve energy security for Tasmania and for Victorians. It’ll be an additional link, a second interconnector – 600 followed by, all being well, a further 600, subject to those studies. That will improve energy security.

JOURNALIST: Minister, should the Victorian Government be pitching in any money for this given that the Tasmanian Government has put some money forward for pumped hydro, should the Victorian Government also be offering funds on their end?

PRIME MINISTER: There are two parts to this project. We’re looking at Marinus. Marinus is what is really helping Victoria. The way this will be worked out is that those who are buying the energy, they will be the ones paying for the energy, at the end of the day. Tasmanians won’t be paying over the odds to see the Marinus Link put in place and for how the electricity will flow between Tasmania and the mainland. The beneficiary of having that reliable power will be in Victoria and the consumers will be the ones who obviously pay the power bills which will be lower, by the way, in terms of what we’re able to produce out of Tasmania. It’s great news for Victorians and it is great news for Tasmanians. In terms of the creating the assets that are here in Tasmania, I mean, that’s where the real value is for Tasmanians. To have these assets and to see them expand and to have Hydro Tasmania be in an even stronger position to return the sort of support they already do to the Tasmanian budget, but I’d say more broadly to the Tasmanian economy. The jobs in all of this is something that makes a lot of sense, so I wasn’t surprised that the Tasmanian Government was so keen to get in behind this project and the Premier has been a champion of this project for a long time – a long, long time.

JOURNALIST: How will the government ensure that Victorians pay more than Tasmanians for project Marinus because the feasibility report says under the current regulations, Tasmanians will bear…

PRIME MINISTER: We’ll take a different approach, but Angus might want to speak to that.

THE HON ANGUS TAYLOR MP, MINISTER FOR ENERGY: There are two ways to build transmission. One is a regulated asset, the other is an unregulated asset and what we believe is that the customers of the service should pay for the service. It’s a simple principle and I think it’s the right principle in this case. The Victorian Government does need to take some responsibility for what it’s doing right now. We’ve seen the failure to take responsibility. The impact that this has had last summer, 200,000 houses losing their lights, we are stepping up. That’s exactly why we’re doing this project. We’re stepping up. But the users of services should pay for a service and that’s the simple principle we’ll apply.

JOURNALIST: Angus, the major renewable company UPC has raised concerns it’s taking a long time to build the second interconnector. Will there be more funding to speed that process up?

THE HON ANGUS TAYLOR MP, MINISTER FOR ENERGY: I think we’ve talked about the funding. We’re providing funding here today to speed the process up, that’s exactly what we’re doing.

PRIME MINISTER: This financial year, by the way. Right now.

THE HON ANGUS TAYLOR MP, MINISTER FOR ENERGY: $56 million dollars from the Federal Government and of course you’ve heard the announcement from the Tasmanian Government, so that’s exactly what we’re doing. We do need to move as quickly as possible because this is an urgent problem that needs to be solved and that’s why we’re here today.

JOURNALIST: UPC is building a wind farm on Robbins Island here in Tasmania. Do you support wind farms?

THE HON ANGUS TAYLOR MP, MINISTER FOR ENERGY: I support affordable, reliable, sustainable electricity and of course that is exactly what we get from Tasmania Hydro and that’s why we are supporting Battery of the Nation and these projects and of course they provide backup to the sorts of projects you’ve just described.

JOURNALIST: Can we have the Prime Minister for other questions now?

PRIME MINISTER: Has everybody covered off what they’d like to on the project?

THE HON WILL HODGMAN MP, PREMIER OF TASMANIA: Can I just make a point about wind in Tasmania and UPC. We are very pleased with UPC and the development of Robbins Island. Their plans are very significant. What this MarinusLink will do is unlock renewable energy development with pumped hydro and with wind, and they complement one another beautifully in Tasmania to benefit the nation. And as the Prime Minister and Angus Taylor have made very clear, customers obviously pay but they benefit through low cost, reliable, clean energy from Tasmania being the Battery of the Nation.

JOURNALIST: I have another energy-related question. Tasmania’s renewable energy was at its most valuable during the carbon tax. What is your government doing to make sure Tasmania is rewarded for its renewable energy contribution?

THE HON ANGUS TAYLOR MP, MINISTER FOR ENERGY: That’s why we’re here today. Tasmania has an enormous amount to offer because of the incredible work of past generations as you heard, which can now be a vision for future generations. That’s what we have here in Tasmania. That’s why we’re here and we want to make sure that the good work that has been done will be properly rewarded. It will also benefit the nation in driving down electricity prices and making sure we can keep the lights on. So this is a fantastic opportunity for Tasmania but also great for the rest of Australia and that’s what makes it such a great project.

PRIME MINISTER: Why don’t we go to federal topics and then I’m sure the Premier’s happy to take state topics. I want to thank Hydro Tasmania for being here today and you’re welcome to stay or if you need to do other things, we understand.

JOURNALIST: Should George Pell be stripped of his Order of Australia?

PRIME MINISTER: My first thoughts when I saw this yesterday, read this yesterday, went to all the victims of child sexual abuse in institutions. Last year, I led the national apology to those victims and I know the events of yesterday, I know for a fact that that would have brought all of that back to people – families, people they lost, and my thoughts are really with them, I’ve got to say. I’ve listened to their stories and I know their pain. I know their pain would have… they would have felt it all again yesterday and it would have been a really tough day for them and it’ll be tough again today as these issues continue.

There’s a legal process underway. That will follow. I said yesterday I was appalled and shocked. I think any Australian would be to read of those events, but it shows that no one is above the law in this country. We do have the law in this country and that law requires a process now to be followed, so I don’t intend to engage in that other than to say to all of you out there who have been victims of child sexual abuse, know that we’re thinking of you. Know that there are people around you who love and care for you and want the best for you. The words that I said in that apology, I say them again to you today. You are not alone and we know it happened and we are there with you.

JOURNALIST: He has been found guilty, though. Will you strip him of the Order of Australia medal?

PRIME MINISTER: There is a process that is always followed in these matters, to wait for the legal process to conclude and I understand the matter is under appeal. That precedent has been established in the past and we’ll follow the normal process.

JOURNALIST: So you won’t form an opinion until the appeals process ends. Has the Cabinet decided that Ita Buttrose should be the Chair of the ABC?

PRIME MINISTER: When I’m in a position to make an announcement about the Chair of the ABC, I will do that.

JOURNALIST: When will that be?

PRIME MINISTER: When I do it.

JOURNALIST: How many Lower House seats can you win in Tasmania?

PRIME MINISTER: I’m after five and six in the Senate. That’s the number of places available and our Government I think has a great story to tell here in Tasmania – all about jobs and the strength of the economy. Premier Hodgman has shown to Tasmanians what can be achieved and they’re going out there and achieving it under his leadership. We’re backing him in and his entire team in by having the policies that support a strong economy. Richard Colbeck was there with us just the other week when I was down here talking about forestry hubs up in north-western Tasmania. We get how to support jobs here in Tasmania. Certainly, Premier Hodgman has and you’ve got people coming back to Tasmania. The population is increasing in Tasmania. I think that is one of the greatest votes of confidence you can see in an economic plan that I could tick. We’re pleased to be part of that. That’s what we’re saying to people in Tasmania. Whether it’s here in Lyons or up in Bass or Braddon or anywhere else in the state, what we’re saying is we have a plan to work with the state government to continue to strengthen the economy. The economy you will live in under a Morrison Government and under a Hodgman Government here in Tasmania will be stronger. Will be stronger than what can be offered by the Labor Party under Bill Shorten.

JOURNALIST: What will you do if the states don’t agree to a disability Royal Commission?

PRIME MINISTER: I believe they will and I want to thank Will for his support for that and I want to thank also Dan Andrews for his support – I met with him earlier this week – and Gladys Berejiklian and Steven Marshall. I’ve written to all the premiers and chief ministers. On the disability Royal Commission, we need to understand that the states and territories all do need to be involved – it is absolutely analogous to the royal commission into institutional child sexual abuse and on that occasion, all states and territories issued joint letters patent. This is where the services and the interface is between people with disabilities and to not have those jurisdictions subject to the Royal Commission, I think would impair it overwhelmingly. And so I honestly am seeking to do this in a bipartisan way, but I don’t agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it can be done without the states and territories. It must be done with the states and territories and the states and territories were very forthcoming when Prime Minister Gillard went forward with her excellent proposal for the Royal Commission and I would expect states and territories, as they already are within in days – I mean, Will and I spoke about this on the weekend –  they will come on board. That is imperative. I think it will be a Royal Commission of a similar size and standing as what we saw with institutional child sexual abuse. Let’s remember that went for four years. It had five commissioners. The Leader of the Opposition said he could do it for $27 million. I don’t know what sort of Royal Commission he was talking about, but it clearly was not one that he had properly thought through. I’ve applied quite a lot of focus to this and been working with our departments. I’ve met with the Disability Commissioner to talk through how this can be proceeded with and we’re making a lot of progress. We’ll continue to work with the states and territories. I appreciate the bipartisan support for this and we’ll just get on with it.

JOURNALIST: Will we see it started before the election?

PRIME MINISTER: I believe that we can get to a terms of reference and letters patent before then. I believe we can, but it took around two and a half months from memory when Prime Minister Gillard instituted the child sexual abuse Royal Commission. That means we’re going to have to move very quickly, but we’re certainly doing that and I think the cooperation from states and territories to date has been very encouraging and I think there’s a real spirit of let’s just do this properly. But make sure we get the terms of reference right so we can set it up so this thing can be above politics and, hopefully, provide the same sort of release, the same sort of support and opportunity for victims of child sexual abuse can now be afforded to people with disabilities who have been the victims of abuse and misconduct and mistreatment. Sadly, this happens in our country. It’s shameful that it does and I believe we’ll be able to arrive at a process hopefully in that time. I’m certainly working to that end.

JOURNALIST: Stephen Jones is also in Tasmania today.

PRIME MINISTER: Good for him.

JOURNALIST: They’re announcing an election commitment towards fixing local black spots. What’s your government doing to address this issue in Tasmania?

PRIME MINISTER: We just announced the Hobart City Deal just the other day so if he wants to come down and play catch up, that’s fine. But what I do know is every time you hear the Labor Party, whether it’s Bill Shorten or anyone else spending money, remember they’re spending your money and they’re increasing your taxes to spend it. When you hear us announce these projects, whether it’s the one I announced today - $56 million going to this project – or the money we’re investing in congestion busting infrastructure in Hobart or the Bridgewater Bridge or any of these projects, that is being done without increasing your taxes.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when do you expect the first asylum seekers will be transferred from Manus Island or Nauru to Christmas Island?

PRIME MINISTER: When that is occurring we’ll be in a position to give further advice. At this time, we continue to work very closely on having to deal with what the Labor Party has done to our border protection laws. I note that they feel all gingered up in recent weeks because of the position they took in the Parliament. Our party, our government remains absolutely resolute that that was the wrong thing for the Labor Party to do. We already have 60 medical professionals on Nauru. All of the children, all of the children are off Nauru and those last four will be leaving very, very shortly. The Labor Party wants to think they’ve been vindicated by politics. This actually shows why they’ve always got border protection wrong. They have only ever seen border protection in a political prism. We’ve always seen it as a responsibility of a government to protect our borders, to ensure we meet our national security obligations and responsibilities. We’ll keep doing that. I don’t know what Bill Shorten’s position is on the issue now. He was against Christmas Island, then he was for Christmas Island, then he was against Christmas Island. It’s another day, so he’s probably got another position. What that demonstrates to you is that the Labor Party can’t hold a consistent position on this issue and if you want to issue an invitation to people smugglers, in the event that you’re able to form a government if that’s indeed what the Labor Party are able to do, Bill Shorten’s going about it exactly the right way – exactly the right way to issue an invitation to people smugglers.

Thank you very much.DOORSTOP - TALBINGO, NSW

LIBERAL CANDIDATE FOR EDEN MONARO, DR FIONA KOTVOJS: Good morning everybody. My name is Fiona Kotvojs, I’m the Liberal Candidate for Eden-Monaro and I’m really excited to be here today. This is a fantastic announcement and I’m really pleased to have such a high calibre team here to make our announcement. The original Snowy was critical for our area and our region. It really transformed us, both in terms of who we are as a community and in terms of power for Australia. And I am… excited is an understatement, to be here and to be part of today and the history making that is happening today. So on that note I would really like to introduce the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. Thank you.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you. Well thank you Dr Kotvojs.  It’s wonderful to be here of course with your colleagues who are well known to you and Paul Broad, the CEO of Snowy Hydro and to be meeting with those who are working here and particularly the Clontarf Boys from Kempsey and Dubbo, it’s great to see you guys. Snowy is a big supporter of the Clontarf Program which you know is something I’ve had involvement with over a long period of time. So it’s good to see how it’s making an impact here as well.

But the impact we’re here to talk about today is a huge investment in Australia’s future. Not just our energy future, not just our climate future - but our economic future. This is a project, when it was first undertaken, it changed our nation. It changed our nation. And this project which began two years ago when Malcolm Turnbull uncovered the old designs and drawings that… I know that the Energy Minister’s grandfather, Angus Taylor’s grandfather, had a key hand in. And we set about the task of turning that into a reality once again because what we’re talking about here is reliable, renewable energy. We’re talking about a 2000 megawatt capacity which can be provided into the energy market, which not only reduces electricity prices and takes the pressure off electricity prices, but it creates the reliability of electricity supply.

As we transition our energy composition into the future, this project is central to that. And not just this project, as I said yesterday. The hydro, pumped hydro projects in Tasmania, the MarinusLink – which is critical in unlocking that – combined this is an enormous part of the climate solutions package that I outlined yesterday. It isn’t just about emissions reduction. That’s an incredibly important part of the program through the Climate Solutions Fund. But this is about impacting on the future of electricity supply in this country. This will be one of the largest pumped hydro projects in the world. There’s only one in Iceland that’s bigger. There are other projects in other parts of the world. But they’re not as big as this one. This is ground-breaking in every sense. And it’s something that I think all Australians can have a great sense of excitement and pride about.

This is what vision looks like and we’ve been working on this project to get it to this point. We’re investing the $1.4 billion in equity into making this project a reality. That really sets it apart. And I think says very clearly what our Government, since we’re elected first time just over five years ago, has been setting out to achieve. That is to secure our future and this project is critical to Australia securing our future.

I want to commend all of those, Paul, who’ve been working so hard on this. Your vision in this, your participation, the outstanding science and engineering capabilities that are a part of the Snowy Hydro family have enabled us to get to where we are today and to ensure we can now move forward with great confidence about the future of this project. Which would not only transform, as Dr Kotvojs said, this area but will indeed once again transform our nation in the same way that the original project did.

So I’m very excited to be here to make that announcement. I acknowledge the work that was done by Prime Minister Turnbull in kicking this project off. As his Treasurer, I worked closely together with him on this project as the now Treasurer, John Frydenberg, as we bought this project together, the Commonwealth took full ownership of Snowy Hydro. That was in Budget…two Budgets ago. And that ensured that we can now do what we are doing here and now. So very excited to be here. I’m going to ask Mathias to talk about the process we’ve been through to make the commercial decision. Because this is a commercial decision. This is a commercial business. This is something that stands on its feet. And will into the future as Snowy Hydro always has. Mathias is going to speak to that. Angus will speak to its impact on the broader energy policy of the government. And Melissa will speak to how this plugs in to our broader Climate Solutions Package which I announced yesterday. And then I’ll ask Paul to make some closing remarks.               

SENATOR THE HON MATHIAS CORMANN, MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE:

Thank you very much Prime Minister. This is a very exciting project. It’s a major project, which will help deliver more affordable, more reliable energy supplies to consumers and to business. It is a project which will help underpin more environmentally efficient energy supplies for a very, very long time to come. Importantly, it is a project that financially stacks up. We always said that we wanted to ensure, before pressing the button on this project, that it made commercial and financial sense and it does.

The Commonwealth will be investing just under $1.4 billion in equity to make this project happen. The remaining cost will be covered by the company through internally generated cash flows and debt financing. The project is projected to generate an internal rate of return of over eight per cent and, indeed, the company is expected to continue to pay dividends to the Commonwealth all throughout the construction phase. It’s a project which will see 2,400 Australians participate in direct jobs during the construction phase and it’s a project that will generate a further 5,000 jobs directly and indirectly in the broader region.

So it’s an exciting day. It is a project which started under the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister. We have gone through a very thorough process, Angus and I, as shareholder Ministers, reviewing the business case that was put forward by the board, making a recommendation to the Expenditure Review Committee and ultimately to the Cabinet. We are very, very confident that not only is this a project which will help deliver more affordable, more reliable energy supplies, it will also do so in a way that will help underpin environmentally more efficient energy supplies into the future and it will do so in a way that is financially and fiscally sustainable. So a great day for Australia.

THE HON ANGUS TAYLOR MP, MINISTER FOR ENERGY: Thanks Mathias. Well what a great day. Over forty years ago, I stood in this very spot with my grandfather who recently retired as Chief Engineer and Commissioner of the Snowy through the construction phase. It was only a year or two after this power station where we stand had been opened. And he explained to us, to my family, the potential and the impact of pumped hydro. He also explained that there was a great, unrealised opportunity for the Snowy Scheme. And that was to build a tunnel from Tantangara to Talbingo and use it for pump hydro. Well today the Prime Minister has announced we will proceed with that fantastic project, linking the past generation of those who built this fantastic scheme with future generations.

Now, our energy market faces some great challenges and opportunities right now. We need more reliable, dispatchable power in the system and we need more storage. We are seeing absolutely unprecedented investment of variable renewable power into our system. Solar and wind. Unprecedented. And that needs backup and it needs storage. And that’s exactly what Snowy 2.0 will deliver. 2000 megawatts of dispatchable capacity that will be there when we need it. Be there when we need to keep the lights on, to keep industry turning. But it also provides an enormous battery. 175 hours of storage in Tantangara Dam. That means when we go for periods where we don’t have sunshine or wind that’s needed to power our electricity market, Snowy can step in at a scale that it hasn’t been able to in the past. That will put downward pressure on prices and it will keep the lights on. We know modelling that’s been done tells us that we can put downward pressure on prices, up to 10 percent, as a result of this project.

The economics work, Mathias has laid that out. The cost of storage in Snowy is less than a fiftieth of the cost of storage in Lithium batteries. The economics stack up. This is a great day for this region. This is a great day for Snowy Hydro. Most of all, this is a great day for Australia.

THE HON MELISSA PRICE MP, MINISTER FOR THE ENVIROMENT: Thanks Angus. It’s lovely to be here today and I particularly just want to acknowledge all the new employees of Snowy and I can see that the excitement is palpable about what Snowy 2.0 will bring for them and their futures and their families and it is lovely to have met you all today. Yesterday with the PM, we announced our $3.5 climate solutions package. There’s been a lot of talk about the fact its $2 billion with respect to the ERF. But there are many other aspects of that particular package. One of them is this project. This $1.4 billion commitment. And why is it important? It’s important that number one we actually support the growth of renewables and we do need to keep the lights on. We need to have low emission, dispatchable power. And what I know is that when it’s needed, Snowy 2.0 is going to provide dispatchable power for over another half a billion homes. This is a great story for this region. As you can see we’re very excited to be here. This is an excellent story for Australia but in particular for Australia’s environment.

PAUL BROAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CEO OF SNOWY HYDRO LIMITED: Thank you very much. Thank you Prime Minister and thank you Ministers. We very much appreciate the fact that you’ve made time in your busy schedules to come down here with us to celebrate what is a huge milestone from all the Snowy family in that high-vis shirts out amongst you. We are very proud of this day. We stand on the shoulders of Angus’ father who looms large in our family. He was a man who drove change. Who had vision beyond his years. We think the generation that comes after us will share our vision, not just for 2.0 but in the other things we have planned for this wonderful Scheme.

The Scheme is in wonderful shape. This beautiful plant you’re looking at here now today. You can’t imagine just what a great job our forefathers did. We plan to do the same. We plan to stand proud on 2.0 so generations after generations will come and say those guys or those guys and girls from that time did a great job. Thank you all for coming today. Thank you to you Prime Minister. Thank you to my two shareholding Minister’s here. Let me tell you. Anyone thinks there’s an easy touch on this thing, I can tell you now, meeting these two guys, it was bare knuckle brawling. And it was very tough. So it should be when you invest dollars of this nature. You’ll want to be robust. Anyone that suggests anything else has totally got it wrong. So thank you all for coming. Thank you Prime Minister and we’ll catch you all soon.

[Applause]

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you Paul. Can I also acknowledge Senator Molan who’s here, as you know, Jim has been a long time force here right across the Eden Monaro area and I want to thank you for being here today as well. So look, why don’t what we usually do and that let’s take questions on this project and then happy to deal with other matters of the day. Can I also acknowledge, as I did before, all the employees that are here today. You can see how excited they are. We’re excited with you. Tremendous to be here with you.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, this project you say is shovel ready. When will first megawatt of power come from this project?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I’ll ask both Paul and Angus to speak to that but as we were flying in here today - which I’ve got to say is one of the most spectacular vistas I’ve seen – and I’ve seen quite a bit. It really was breathtaking. But Paul said within a week, there’s going to be work being done. Within a week. Now this is a huge project and they can take you through the timetables of when these projects come online. And they take many years to get to where you’re actually generating power. I mean, you’ve got to start somewhere and we start this week. But Paul, would you want to speak to that? Thanks Paul.

PAUL BROAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CEO OF SNOWY HYDRO LIMITED: Yeah the plan is the project will be online in ‘24, maybe early ‘25. But the first bit of power we hope to be out here in about October, November ‘24. We are shovel ready. Early works will start in the next four days. So the road works down [inaudible] we’re going to build the, where the village is going to be. Early works into the [inaudible] will be starting straight away.  

JOURNALIST: So the metre or the megawatts will tick over in 2024 then?

PAUL: That’s it.

JOURNALIST: If Liddell goes offline in 2022, are we in a bit of a gap there then? With enough generation? 

PRIME MINISTER: Well the New South Wales Government has a range of options available to it particularly with what they’re doing on transmission lines when it comes to accessing [inaudible] for New South Wales. And those are questions that really have to be addressed to the New South Wales Government about how they will be managing that. Our job here is to ensure in the areas where we have the opportunity to effectively firm the nation’s, particularly the east coast, power supply – we do just that. And that’s what this project is all about. If you want to transition over time to renewable future, for energy. Then you need… you cannot do it without stations like this. And stations like in Tasmania. I mean because as we all know, the wind does not blow all the time and the sun does not always shine. And it’s these projects that the battery we’re talking about here is just immense. And that firms, firms the renewable power investments that we make in other types of renewable power because this will be here to back it up when those power sources fail.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when the business case was released originally, two key chapters were redacted which meant many of your backbench couldn’t actually see how this stacked up. Now trusting you that this actually does stack up, can you say what you’ll roughly buy the power for and what you will sell it for?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I’ll Mathias work through the business case for you and how the decision was taken or Paul can do that.

PAUL BROAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CEO OF SNOWY HYDRO LIMITED:  As you know, we did a deal just before Christmas when we announced 888 megawatts of renewables and the average price for buying that was $40 and the peak price in the market gets somewhere around $100 – so you’re roughly buying for $40, roughly selling at a $100. So a $60 spread which drives the economics. Now they’re very conservative numbers. As you were seeing two weekends ago, there were negative prices in the market so we haven’t even factored that part into it. So taken the numbers we know are solid, the deals are done and signed up. 888 megawatts of renewables today. So we’ll do those deals and that will roughly be what the pumping price will be in our models – and roughly the selling price.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister one of the problems with this is that it originally wasn’t viable because electricity was so cheap. It’s only now that electricity is so expensive that this project is viable. Is it natural to say that we’ll never see electricity prices get back to where they were otherwise this wouldn’t be viable?

PRIME MINISTER: No, no…

PAUL BROAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CEO OF SNOWY HYDRO LIMITED:  Can I just say something on that? The coal price today, to generate just to cover the black coal price in New South Wales, to generate… just the coal price is $56. In those days when you had very low price and a massive oversupply and coal price were nothing like that. So as coal prices have increased, particularly black coal, so the average marginal cost of generation has gone up. Now most of the generation still comes from coal plans – 74 per cent of the market is still supplied by coal. As renewable is coming in, the prices are coming down. As we said the other day when we did the deal on renewables and firmed it up, so that’s equivalent to baseload, we firming that in sub-seventy. We think that price is going to look like sub-sixties. So in the next five-ten years, we think there is downward pressure on prices. The MJA model, which we’ve done independently of us, they’ve modelled this thing going out to 2050. They’re saying the downward pressure on prices, as the Minister said, is roughly 10 per cent. So what we’re doing here, and what the Prime Minister and Ministers have announced is not only just on renewables but is putting increased competition in the wholesale market to deliver up for consumers a lower price. 

SENATOR THE HON MATHIAS CORMANN, MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE: The key is, this project will help make renewable energy supplies more affordable and more reliable. That is at the core, that is the whole point. When you’ve got a reliance on solar and wind energy and the sun does not shine, the wind does not blow, that leads not only to reliability issues, it also leads to spikes in prices. What this enables you to do is to make sure that you have a back-up, which is environmentally efficient, which will help obviously lower those price peaks, so that across the board, the energy supplies are not only more reliable but also more affordable and it adds to the competitive piece, which will improve the market overall. So it is a very substantial and very important investment, both in terms of ensuring that our economy can have access to reliable, affordable energy, but also, in making sure that this is something that stacks up financially.

PRIME MINISTER: In short, without this project, electricity prices will be higher.

JOURNALIST: Will families, though, experience cheaper power bills because of Snowy 2.0?

PRIME MINISTER: Well let’s be clear that already, already under the national energy market prices that we’re seeing now are lower than they have been. So that is already occurring. You need to understand that this project fits into a broader plan for energy across Australia. This is one component of it. I’ve also made mention of the Battery of the Nation which is a similar project, pumped hydro down in Tasmania. Now what we announced yesterday on the Marinus interconnector, there is 400 megawatts just sitting there in Tasmania at the moment that can’t make its way to the mainland. Now that would have been very helpful when Victoria had their crisis a little while ago. And so whether it’s the MarinusLink, whether it’s the battery project, whether it’s this project and everything else which is being done on the LRET and SRE and all of these projects. All of that is working together to ensure that we have downward pressure on electricity prices.

One of the most significant thing that happened late last year was when Angus was over to get the agreements of the states and territories to enter into the reliable energy guarantee. Now, this is a critically important part of energy policy. What that means is you’ll have a higher degree of, a higher proportion, of reliable energy contracted into the energy market whereas currently that type of reliable supply enters the market at inflated prices because of shortfalls that may occur from time to time. So what the reliable energy guarantee, which this Government authored, that was taken through the states and territories late last year. Josh Frydenberg had previously worked on that as the Energy Minister. I’d been involved in that as the Treasurer. Previously Malcolm Turnbull has been involved. You can’t cherry pick just one element of this plan. This is a comprehensive plan. It’s a comprehensive plan to ensure we have a reliable, sustainable energy future. It is also a plan to ensure that Australia continues to meet its environmental commitments both today and into the future.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what is the total cost estimate… what is the total cost estimate of this project and can you guarantee there won’t be blowouts because of the complexity?

PRIME MINISTER: I’ll ask other Ministers to comment. But obviously our equity contribution here is just under $1.4 billion.

SENATOR THE HON MATHIAS CORMANN, MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE: So the feasibility study identified a cost range of $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion and the advice we’ve got is that that is still the most reliable estimate. Looking at the contracts that have been led by Snowy Hydro so far, we’re very confident that it will come in within that range. In terms of the financing of it, as the Prime Minister said, we will be contributing an equity contribution of just under $1.4 billion and the company will be responsible independently for the financing of the remainder of the project costs through a combination of internally generated cash flows and debt financing. But with an internal rate of return, a projected internal rate of return in excess of 8 per cent, we are very comfortable that this is completely viable. In fact, our expectation is that the company will continue to pay dividends to the Government, as its shareholder, all the way through the construction phase.

PRIME MINISTER:  [Inaudible] Now, we didn’t get here today because someone just drove around on a ute and had a bit of a look around and say ‘I reckon’. That’s not what happened. What Paul’s team has been doing to work out the proposal... He was showing me on the way in where they were dropping the bores along the route which the tunnel will go so they could understand the geology they are going to have to drill through, so they can understand what that cost will be. We have been on this job for two years to get to this point. That’s a lot of homework that’s been done to go into the estimates upon which we have made our investment decision today and again I want to thank Paul and his entire team who have done the real hard work that enables the government to make a decision like this.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you’re a numbers man. How many coal fired power stations could you build with $1.4 billion?

PRIME MINISTER: Well you put Battery of the Nation together with this project that’s around three. That’s the same as about three. Both of them are reliable power generation but this one has lower emissions.

JOURNALIST: And that is what you are comfortable with, lower emissions over lower prices?

SENATOR THE HON MATHIAS CORMANN, MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE: Lower prices.

PRIME MINISTER: Lower emissions, lower prices and reliability. That’s what I’m looking for. This is the objective. This is what the Australian people also want.

JOURNALIST: But this isn’t real fair dinkum power for you, is it?

PRIME MINISTER: No it is, it’s absolutely fair dinkum power. It doesn’t get more fair dinkum than this. This is fair dinkum. A hundred percent.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what about the cost of updating the transmission network to make the most of this power? Do we have estimates of that and who will pay for that?

PRIME MINISTER: I’ll ask Paul… do you want to talk about that? Because the transmission issue goes through a normal process through the regulator and there are state governments that have particular responsibilities.

THE HON ANGUS TAYLOR MP, MINISTER FOR ENERGY: Yeah look, we’re going through reviews regularly now of transmission upgrades and there will be transmission upgrades. They need to stand alone. They need to work on their own. Stand on their own two feet as viable investments and that will certainly be the case with the transmission lines that will support Snowy. There is a need for extra transmission just to support Snowy as it is. So that work is being done independently but it’s going to stand on its own two feet.

JOURNALIST: Minister Price, we haven’t had a chance to speak with you since this reset of energy and environment policy. The NEG was a very clear plan that voters understood. How would you articulate quite concisely the Government’s energy and environment policy?

THE HON MELISSA PRICE MP, MINISTER FOR THE ENVIROMENT: Well I think they are very complimentary. I mean we already see in the electricity sector, you know the next three years the contribution of renewables to the energy space is going to be about 250 per cent. But we’ve heard today is yes we’ve got our $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Fund, which there are many elements to that and ensuring we turn the lights on, the lights come on. That’s what we’re here talking about today. Lower emissions but reliability, making sure that the system works and we’re very proud of that.

JOURNALIST: Minister, what would you say to criticisms that you’ve been absent when the government has announced the environmental policy they’re taking to the next election?

PRIME MINISTER: The criticism are untrue. It’s the usual sort of froth and bubble that comes out of the bubble.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you acknowledge Malcolm Turnbull’s role in getting this rolling.

PRIME MINISTER: Absolutely.

JOURNALIST: Yesterday you announced an extension of Tony Abbott’s Direct Action Plan. Will we see any more ideas coming directly from you on environment?

[Laughter]

PRIME MINISTER: You seem to forget the fact I’ve been in the Government for the last five and a half years and have played a key role in all of these decisions actually as a Minister, as a Treasurer. And particularly on the energy sub-committee of Cabinet that the former Prime Minister actually put in place where these projects emanated from. So I’ve been pleased to be playing a role in all of this and I’m also pleased to acknowledge the significant work done by my predecessors. I was in contact with Malcolm last night and he was very thrilled about the announcement we are making today and I’ve seen him make those comments today. It took his vision to see this and unearth those drawings. I probably won’t trouble the engineers as much here today as he might have normally…

[Laughter]

With his technical knowledge of the topic. But what I like is the numbers and how they stack up as a former Treasurer and Malcolm and I had a lot to do with each other on this project and when we first talked about ensuring that the Commonwealth, when I was Treasurer, would be able to take on Snowy 100 per cent. As Paul and I were discussion today, without that I don’t think we would be standing here today. That was a key decision that we took and it required us to enter into arrangements with both the New South Wales and Victorian state governments which the Treasury was directly involved in at the time and I led that process. I’ve always been happy to be part of the team, whether I’m sitting in the team or I’m leading the team as I am today.

JOURNALIST: Paul mentions there was ‘bare knuckle brawling’ to get this underway. What was the Government’s reservations?

PRIME MINISTER: We just want to make sure it was commercially stacking up. I mean, that’s what you would expect, that’s what the Australian people would expect of us. I mean, as I say, we weren’t going to sign it off on the basis of people running around on a ute and saying ‘I reckon’. That’s not how we do things.

JOURNALIST: So what’s the case of break glass, election imminent we need environment policy – something we can…

PRIME MINISTER: No, I think that’s very unfair.

SENATOR THE HON MATHIAS CORMANN, MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE: Let me give you a little bit of a contrast. When the Rudd Government first, out of Opposition, decided to roll out the NBN, their business plan was written up on the back of a beer coaster. We went through a very thorough process. We make no apologies for that. We went through the feasibility process. We engaged with the board and with the management in relation to that and ultimately, we wanted to see a business case that, yes, stacked up in terms of delivering the affordable, more reliable energy supplies into the future, in a way that would underpin environmentally, more efficient energy supplies into the future, but we also wanted to see that the numbers stacked up and that we had the best, most appropriate financial model on behalf of taxpayers. Inevitably, that involves a level of engagement and discussions and scrutinising of all the facts and figures. You do not just accept as given all of the assumptions that are put to you, these things inevitably get scrutinised. What I can say to Australians is they can have great confidence that this project stacks up. We absolutely scrutinised it thoroughly and with a microscope. So it’s a great day because it is a project that will deliver for Australians, in terms of reliable, affordable energy, but it will also stack up financially.

JOURNALIST: Paul, if I could just ask you. You mentioned negative prices on power for when wind is up and that is when it is a key juncture. Couldn’t that then destroy the market place…

Paul: Not at all. Actually, what happened is with 2.0, they obviously want to pick the bottom of the troughs in the off peaks so when the winds blowing a lot you set a floor in the market price. It underpins those investments. It makes them look more sound. So we’ll be using enormous amount of energy when there’s excess. When there’s excess wind or excess sun. Or even excess baseload generation as there is today. So we buy from the market at the most competitive price to underpin the public. We do it here today in T3. The largest pump hydro, you’re looking at it.

JOURNALIST: The International Monetary Fund has predicted we’re going to have flat wage growth for around six years. Are you concerned by that? What can you do to remedy that and how do you respond to it?

PRIME MINISTER: Well the first response is a stronger economy. You’re not going to get stronger wage growth if you don’t have a stronger economy. And you’re not going get a stronger economy if you put $200 billion of higher taxes on the economy, which is what Bill Shorten and Labor are going to do if they’re elected. I mean, that will throw a big, wet blanket on the Australian economy. And that will dampen wages. The other thing you don’t want to do is you don’t go and put a 45 per cent emission reduction target on the Australian economy. Now, our figure’s 26 per cent. We’ve made that very clear. I set out yesterday how I get to 26 per cent. I did it literally, literally by tonne. How we will meet that target in the same way we met the 2020 target. Turning around Labor’s emissions deficit by 1.1 billion tonne of abatement. That what we achieved. We haven’t just turned around their fiscal deficit. We’ve turned around their climate deficit where we’ve been able to improve the situation by 1.1 billion tonnes. Now, what Labor have not done is told the country how they will get to that 45 per cent emissions reduction target. People can disagree with me, whether it should be 26 or 45. But I’ve made it very clear how I get to 26 per cent. How our team gets to 26 per cent. The onus is on Bill Shorten now to explain to the Australian people how does he reach his 45 per cent emissions reduction target. And using the exact same methodology I have, that means he would need three times the amount of abatement – actually more than three times – the amount of abatement by 2030. So what does that mean for jobs? What does it mean for wages? You ask about wages. $9000 a year worse off as a result of Bill Shorten’s…

JOURNALIST: That’s a long time without a pay rise.

PRIME MINISTER: …Emissions reduction target. Well and under Bill Shorten – they won’t get anything.

JOURNALIST: No, it’s not about Bill.

PRIME MINISTER: No, no it is about Bill Shorten.

JOURNALIST: What are you going to do?

PRIME MINISTER: Stronger economy. We’ve had record jobs growth and the corner has been turned on wages growth, that’s not just me saying that. That’s the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. We’re now back over two per cent in terms of real wage growth in this country… in terms of wage growth in this country. And it wasn’t that long ago that it was sub 2 per cent – on the right side of 2 per cent. We are seeing that firming. But I tell you, you will not get stronger wages growth if you weaken the Australian economy. It is a fairly obvious point. And when you apply $200 billion of higher taxes and a 45 per cent emissions reduction target, you are turning the lights off on the Australian economy. And you will not get higher wages under Bill Shorten. All you’ll get is higher taxes. Thanks very much everyone.


FAINE: So you’ve gone from coal-aphobia to recognising a climate emergency. What’s your credibility on climate policy?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, those things are mutually exclusive, Jon. I mean, we are allowed to have reliable energy. That’s okay. And we’re also able to reduce our emissions. These two things can be achieved. And how do I know that? Because that’s exactly what we’ve been doing. When we came to government in 2013, we inherited a more than-700 million tonne deficit on meeting our 2020 emissions targets. Now we’re going to beat that by 367 million tonnes through the measures that I am saying will be extended today. And that’s continued to occur…

FAINE: Five years after this virtually the same proposal was abandoned, so we’ve lost five years.

PRIME MINISTER: It wasn’t abandoned. It hasn’t been abandoned. It’s been running for the last five years. I mean there are…

FAINE: Sorry, what you’re announcing today?

PRIME MINISTER: That program has been running and we’re extending it as part of what I’m announcing today.

FAINE: You’re allocating more funds for more of it…

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

FAINE: It’s been undersold, underprepared, underrun…

PRIME MINISTER: No, Jon, none of that is true.

FAINE: And now suddenly you’re saying, ‘We’ve got an election coming we’ve got to crank it up.’

PRIME MINISTER: No, Jon, none of what you’ve just said is true at all. What we’ve been…

FAINE: That’s the ACF’s analysis of it.

PRIME MINISTER: They’re welcome to make their commentary, like anyone is. But we have been running this program and it’s been responsible for around 200 million tonnes of abatement over the period of running those programs. It has been a successful program that has helped us meet our existing targets, the 2020 target, which we will now beat by 367 million tonnes, and will be a key role in meeting our 2030 targets, which we’ll meet in a canter.

FAINE: Isn’t the reality, in fact though, that you’re on a tightrope, on the one hand you’ve got the coal lobby and the resources sector, some of whom are changing their mind, mind you, on one side, what works with the coal industry is disastrous for people who want action and more action on climate change, and you’re on that tightrope trying to juggle the two.

PRIME MINISTER: No, Jon, what I’ve got is a sensible, practical policy which is based on reducing our emissions, which we need to do and have done, and a plan to keep doing that out to 2030 and meet our targets which will see emissions per capita fall per person by more than 50 percent and our emissions intensity fall by more than two thirds. Now, only Brazil has got a target better than that in the G20. That’s better than everyone else, what we’re doing, and our record of achievement is one that says, we meet our targets when we set them. We set them responsibly. And I don’t believe I have to choose between our environment and our economy. I think both are achievable. And what we’ve got is the runs on the boards to demonstrate that.

FAINE: And to those who say…

PRIME MINISTER: So these misperceptions that are out there, well that’s for them to explain. All I know is our record.

FAINE: Too little, too late, is the widely heard rejoinder.

PRIME MINISTER: How can it be ‘too little, too late’ when what we’ve put in place means we exceed our targets by 367 million tonnes? Explain that to me.

FAINE: Well, those targets keep shifting around, apart from [inaudible].

PRIME MINISTER: No, they don’t. They haven’t moved around at all. We had our 2020 target, which we had, and we’re going to meet it and beat it. We’ve turned around a 700 million tonne deficit that Labor left us, to achieve that target. And we’re going to better it by 367 million tonnes. Now that’s a 1.1 billion tonne turnaround on emission reductions that our government has achieved. Now the plan I’m outlining today builds on that success. See, one of the problems with this debate, Jon, is that it doesn’t focus on the results, I mean, what’s the real test of a policy? That it meets the objectives that it set out to achieve. And that’s exactly what we’ve done. Now there’s been a lot of hot air and shouting at the clouds on this issue, but what we’ve done is just get on and achieve. And our plan to achieve our 2030 targets is based on the success of the policy that we already have in place. And how do I know it is successful? We’re going to beat our target.

FAINE: Some of that shouting and hot air has come from your side of the ledger.

PRIME MINISTER: Well there’s been plenty of shouting and hot air, Jon, but what I’m saying is…

FAINE: Well, to those on your side, who have been holding up or even saying there is no need for further action on climate change, what do you say to them today?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, what I’m saying is, whatever people have been saying, we’ve just been getting on with the job. That’s what our government has been doing. See, this is what I’m talking about, the debate runs around, and whether it’s the bubble or anything else, what matters is what gets done. And we believe we need to take action in this area and have been ever since we come to government, turning around, you know, Labor talks big on this, but they left us a 700 million tonne deficit on carbon abatement, and we’ve turned that around by 1.1 billion. So, that’s our record and I stand by it. And it’s with programs that were started, like the Emissions Reduction Fund, it’s continuing the programs of ARENA and CFC and all of this, Battery of the Nation which we’re backing in, and particularly the Marinus Interlink with Tasmania, I mean, that of itself, with reliable hydro, that’s a 2,500 megawatt capacity.

FAINE: Snowy Hydro 2, still committed?

PRIME MINISTER: Snowy Hydro 2, absolutely, totally.

FAINE: Okay…

PRIME MINISTER: I mean, that’s all part of the plan.

FAINE: You know, the Labor Party love it every time you talk about them?

PRIME MINISTER: The Labor Party?

FAINE: Mmm.

PRIME MINISTER: I don’t really care what they think.

FAINE: But…

[Laughter]

FAINE: But every time you reference them, every time you make them more relevant. They go, ‘Cha-ching, cha-ching, hooray, thank you. That’s the Prime Minister doing our work for us.’

PRIME MINISTER: I’m not quite sure what you’re referring to. When I refer to the Labor Party, I talk about the fact that their emissions reduction targets are going to cost wage earners $9,000 each a year. That’s what the independent evaluation showed last year. You want to talk about the Labor Party…

FAINE: That’s contested…

PRIME MINISTER: I talk about how they’re going to hit retirees with a $5 billion a year tax.

FAINE: Well, they’re announcing today a $640 million fund over four years for what they call ‘bank fairness’.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, the Labor Party’s answer to every question, Bills Shorten’s answer to every question is higher taxes. I mean, how much tax does he think the Australian economy can bear? He already has it at $200 billion in higher taxes over the next 10 years…

FAINE: He’s proposing tax relief for most Australians whilst at the same time going to get rid of what he says is a rort…

PRIME MINISTER: Jon, that’s not true…

FAINE: That some people have exploited through access to franking credits.

PRIME MINISTER: I’m sorry Jon, I’m going to do a fact check on you okay.

FAINE: Excellent, we like that.

PRIME MINISTER: $144 billion is the legislated tax cuts that we currently have taken through the Parliament. Labor have said they are going to halve that.

FAINE: Mmhmm.

PRIME MINISTER: So how can they be providing more tax relief when they’re actually halving the amount of tax relief that is currently legislated before the Parliament?

FAINE: I’ll leave that for Mr Shorten and Mr Bowen to explain but it’s going to be an interesting contest.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, you’re the one who said that they’re cutting taxes.

FAINE: Well, they, I, I’m referring to what their policy claims are, which is only reasonable.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think they are highly dubious. Bill Shorten’s answer to every question is, ‘I’ll just tax you more.’

FAINE: Overnight, its been announced by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs that the Dawn Service in France at the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial Centre, the Monash Centre, which has just been completed at a cost of, I think, $100 million, they don’t want to run a Dawn Service anymore, they want to move it to a 10 o’clock ANZAC Day service, what’s your view, is it good or bad?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, that’s not gonna happen. I’ve spoken to the Minister this morning, the service will go ahead at dawn as usual.

FAINE: Because?

PRIME MINISTER: Because that’s the right decision.

FAINE: Regardless of what it costs and how many people turn up?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I think it’s important to continue the Dawn Service in the way it’s been done. I’ve discussed that matter with the Minister this morning and they will consult with the local community there, but I believe the Dawn Service should continue in its current form and I’ve made that very clear to the Minister this morning.

FAINE: That will be very welcome news in many quarters, Dawn Services are Dawn Services, they’re not 10 o’clock in the morning/morning tea services.

PRIME MINISTER: I agree. And when this matter was brought to my attention, I dealt with it.

FAINE: They’re incredibly moving, it’s astonishing that so many people now turn up all over Australia and all around the world.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah, well it’s true. I mean, other services, you know, when we have the 11am services on Armistice Day, they are equally also very moving, there’s an importance about that time. Now, I understand that the Villers-Bretonneux service, the dawn element of that is different to what it is at Gallipoli, I mean it was a dawn landing in Gallipoli, but that said, there is a tradition that has developed in recent times about that service in Villers-Bretonneux and I want to ensure the integrity of that is kept because the people I care most about on this is our veterans and how they feel about it.

FAINE: It’s a cliché for journalists to ask Prime Ministers about Newspoll, and the latest Newspoll’s come out this morning, so I won’t ask you about the figures which show nothing’s changed, but border protection has been a lively issue during the last two weeks, and the figures haven’t budged. Does that mean border protection is not something that changes peoples’ votes?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, whether it is or whether it isn’t is not really my concern. What my concern is that we have strong border protection and that’s the only thing that’s ever motivated me.

FAINE: And you were hoping that that would result in an improvement for your side in the polls.

PRIME MINISTER: No, I was hoping that I would be able to stop the Labor Party from weakening our border protection. That’s what I was hoping. And now I’m taking action to make sure that it doesn’t.

FAINE: So Newspoll’s result on this issue specifically, in the last little while, would suggest that the parties are level-pegging on that topic…

PRIME MINISTER: That’s not actually true…

FAINE: When peoples’ voting intention…

PRIME MINISTER: No, that’s actually not true if you read what the polls said today. I mean, the Coalition is overwhelmingly favoured to the Labor Party when it comes to national security and the economy. But my point is this Jon, when it comes to border protection or these measures, the only thing that ever drives me on this is making sure that it’s strong and secure so I never have to see the human carnage of 1,200 people who died at sea ever again. That’s what motivates me. That’s why I’ve done everything I’ve done in this area.

FAINE: Would you do the same if it cost you votes?

PRIME MINISTER: I would.

FAINE: That’s hard to believe.

PRIME MINISTER: Well Jon, you can make up whatever mind you like about this but when it comes to border protection, I don’t think anyone can doubt my conviction, sincerity on this.

FAINE: I think we all want to see people not drowning…

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I know how to stop that, Jon.

FAINE: … we also have a view of assessing politicians and what they offer and we always see it through the prism of what’s going to get them re-elected.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah, well you see Jon, I have a very unique perspective on this because I was the one who had to stop it. And I had to make the decisions that resulted in that.  So I am probably well qualified to make a judgement about how you stop boats and how you stop deaths at sea. Plenty of other people have opinions that have no consequences but when you are the minister responsible for doing it, you have to make the decisions and you have to deal with the consequences of those decisions. And that’s what I’ve done. And I’ve always done it for one simple purpose. That is, our borders should be strong, and I don’t want to see kids on boats dying.

FAINE: And it, also, has been a key part of your ascendancy to a leadership position and ultimately being the Prime Minister, which is, I’m not suggesting for a moment that you would only do it for those reasons but the two fit well together.  They fitted, they dove-tailed together.

PRIME MINISTER: So what are you suggesting?

FAINE: If those policies were unpopular, would you have still pursued them?

PRIME MINISTER:  Yes.  Because some of those policies were unpopular. I remember turnbacks, before the 2013 election. I was lectured on the fact that they wouldn’t work, and that wasn’t actually a particular popular policy, back in 2013.  If you, sort of, have a look back, you’ll see that’s the case.   Regional processing was more acceptable, temporary protection visas was more acceptable.  Well I can tell you, turnbacks was not a popular policy over that time and it was split quite evenly, but I knew that if unless you did that, and did it successfully, you could not stop the boats.  So, I did it with General Campbell and others who were very involved in pulling all that together, and Jim Molan, and we had a plan.  We were mocked about that plan, on the ABC, in Fairfax, in other places.  They mocked us, they said it couldn’t be done, the Labor Party said it couldn’t be done, the Greens said it couldn’t be done.  Well you were wrong. It could be done, it was done. It was achieved. And I am never going to allow our border protection regime, if I have anything to do with it, from being compromised again because the consequences of that are deadly.

FAINE: So you will do anything you can to get the best laws in place to advance those policies but you rejected the advice of the security agencies on the medevac laws last week …

PRIME MINISTER: No, that’s not true…

FAINE: and it wasn’t enacted.

PRIME MINISTER: No that’s not true. That report was rubbish.

FAINE: They said that you could include in Kerryn Phelps’ legislation…

PRIME MINISTER: We opposed the bill.

FAINE:  …a provision that would allow for people to be medevaced to Australia but then returned.

PRIME MINISTER: No, no…

FAINE: and you didn’t adopt that recommendation.

PRIME MINISTER: No, no, Jon, you’ve got to stop reading the Saturday paper. It’s not true.  That report is just not true. That bill...

FAINE: What half of it was not true? That was the advice from the security agency.

PRIME MINISTER: No it wasn’t Jon. It wasn’t.  We declassified the advice. We released the advice.

FAINE: Partially leaked to the Australian newspaper.

PRIME MINISTER: We declassified the advice so Jon, what you are putting to me…

FAINE: The security agencies had to say “Hang on, that’s not what we said”..

PRIME MINISTER: No Jon, what you are putting to me is just not true.

FAINE: What part of it?

PRIME MINISTER: I’m saying the report is not true. Ok? So we acted in accordance with our security advice, and that was, that bill should not be accepted. That bill was going to weaken our border security arrangements…and it has.

FAINE: That bill can be improved. That bill can be improved with a simple addition

PRIME MINISTER: No, it can’t actually Jon, you can’t. That bill in any form was going to weaken our border protection laws. In any form. Any form.

FAINE: But if it was going to go through because you no longer control the numbers…

PRIME MINISTER: No, I’m not going to split hairs with you Jon…

FAINE: … it can be ameliorated and improved.

PRIME MINISTER: …on border protection I don’t trade.  It’s absolute.  And that’s how I act. So, we acted in accordance with our security advice. It’s a bad change to the law. It;s actually now complicated even further, frankly, how these matters are arranged.  But I’ll tell you one thing.  At least people know what my view is on this Jon. I mean Bill Shorten has changed his position on Christmas Island every day. So, I mean, who are you going to trust?  Someone who doesn’t know what they think about this issue and are swayed by whoever spoke to them last.  Or someone who’s actually had very real experience in this area, has got the results, and knows what they think.

FAINE: 13 minutes to 9, Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister is with me, we’re running out of time rapidly. There’s been several calls over the weekend for you to return to a John Howard definition of ministerial  accountability, which would have seen at least Mathias Cormann, if not others also coming into strife in the last week or two.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think you have made a couple of leaps there Jon.  I mean, I mean, what was discussed last week was shown to be of no substance.

FAINE: Which bit?

PRIME MINISTER: Well all of it.

FAINE: Well Mathias Cormann didn’t pay for travel.

PRIME MINISTER: And he paid it back.

FAINE: It was offered to him, once…

PRIME MINISTER: Once it was drawn to his attention, he paid it back.

FAINE: Once it was made public.

PRIME MINISTER: Bill Shorten didn’t declare a donation to his own campaign for eight years.  So I am not going to get lectured by the Labor Party.

FAINE: No it wasn’t the Labor Party actually, I’m not even aware of what the Labor Party…

PRIME MINISTER: Well it was the Labor Party who pulled this out of their…

FAINE: This doesn’t pass the sniff test…

PRIME MINISTER: …out of their bottom smear draw because they were under pressure in the Parliament. And that’s, look I get it, I get it how all that works…

FAINE: The Minister in charge of finances who doesn’t look after his own credit card transactions.

PRIME MINISTER: He paid back the money and that’s the end of the matter.

FAINE: Doesn’t pass the sniff test, does it?

PRIME MINISTER: That’s your assertion.

FAINE: Major contract goes from a government department to a …

PRIME MINISTER: There’s no link between those Jon, look Jon, if the Labor Party wants to get into those smears, look, I understand that.  But, I, I don’t think I should allow you to draw a connection between those two events because there is no connection between those events, there is none.  There was no connection between Minister Cormann and the decision on that contract.  None. Absolutely none. He wasn’t the decision maker.

FAINE: And Joe Hockey likewise?

PRIME MINISTER: Joe Hockey is not even a member of the Government.

FAINE: He says, ‘hang on’…

PRIME MINISTER: Joe works for DFAT. And so I am sure the Secretary will deal with whatever, if any, matters there are to be dealt with as she made clear to estimates last week.  This was a smear campaign by a desperate Labor Party that was under the pump and those who want to sort of support the Labor Party by continuing to give that oxygen well, they can, but that’s what it is.

FAINE: Ita Buttrose, not on the list, of possible chairs, of the board of this organisation the ABC but certainly well-placed sources in today’s newspapers say even though there were no men on the list that was put to Cabinet, Ita Buttrose may leapfrog the field?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, two things, a) Cabinet have not considered this matter, Cabinet will soon consider this matter. It is true that she was not one of those who have been independently recommended. I can confirm that the independent recommendations did not include a female candidate…

FAINE: None at all?

PRIME MINISTER: None at all.

FAINE: What was your reaction when you saw the list?

PRIME MINISTER: Surprise…

FAINE: Surprise? Disappointment?

PRIME MINISTER: Oh, of course.  But, anyway, the Government will make a decision and we will go through the normal processes that are required in terms of consultation with the Opposition and on that, the rules on that are very clear by the way.  But the Labor Party is over assuming on what that entitles them to but they already think they have won the election and that seems to be the way that they’re behaving.

FAINE: You have meetings with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews today…

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

FAINE: What’s on the agenda?

PRIME MINISTER: A number of issues.  I was in Gippsland yesterday, meeting with drought affected farmers, and they have raised a number of issues with me about support.  I mean, the two biggest things they’re seeking Jon is,one the fodder subsidies which are provided in NSW and Queensland, and what that did, is that it has lifted the price of fodder and Victorian farmers are now in a double whammy of having to pay higher prices for their fodder but also not having the subsidies.  Now those subsidies are provided by state governments and they are very keen to see those provided by the state Government.  And the other issue is rate relief.  And again, that’s a matter for state governments.

FAINE: Local council rate relief?

PRIME MINISTER: Local council rate relief.  I spoke to local farmers yesterday and there rates are in the tens of thousands. I mean, the councils themselves, it’s about 45-50% of their revenue base so they have got a lot of work to do in this area too, so look, I’ll relay that to the Premier.  I think he and I are working quite well together on this issue so I am just, so, l, that’s what they raised with me.  We will continue to provide the support we do through drought assistance.

FAINE: We are going to see a bit more of you in Victoria in the next few months…

PRIME MINISTER: Oh. I am, you certainly will.  The $5 billion drought fund that went through the House of Representatives.  I was genuinely quite surprised Labor voted against the drought fund.  I mean, I’m still shaking my head about it to be honest.

FAINE: And we’ve got seats now, Liberal seats which the Labor Party, with what are projected to be swings, seats that they now have within their their gaze, which otherwise they thought were well beyond their reach so we will see more of you.

PRIME MINISTER: Oh, elections are always a contest whether it’s are in Victoria, or North Queensland, or Western Australia, we will be everywhere.

FAINE: Do we clone Scott Morrison’ so you can try and get around more places than you otherwise can?

PRIME MINISTER: (laugh) No, I think one is enough. 

FAINE: (laugh)

PRIME MINISTER: I think one is enough for you Jon.

FAINE: No, well, we don’t get enough time…

PRIME MINISTER: Well I am pleased to be here with you today.

FAINE: We may have an overinflated sense of our self-importance.  We like to see the Prime Minister here in town.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I am happy to be here.

FAINE: It’s good when we do have the chance.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks Jon.

FAINE: I’ve made you late for your next appointment.  I’ve got your staff glaring at me through the glass, I’ll have to let you go.

PRIME MINISTER: Not a problem.

FAINE: Thank you for your time this morning.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you.INTERVIEW ON ABC NEWS BREAKFAST

PAUL KENNEDY: Prime Minister, thank you very much for your time.

PRIME MINISTER: G’Day.

KENNEDY: What is the difference between your Climate Solutions Fund and the Emissions Reduction Fund created by Tony Abbott?

PRIME MINISTER: It guess beyond the Emissions Reduction fund. So it is embracing many others projects as well.  But the Emissions Reduction Fund which Tony Abbott started has been a great success. I mean it has been responsible for about 200 million tonnes abatement and it was always our intention that we would need to extend that out to ensure we met our 2030 targets, which we will. The 2020 targets we will meet comfortably by around 367 million tonnes in addition to what our commitments was. Now let’s remember when we came to government we were inheriting a deficit on that of some 700 million tonnes. So that is a 1.1 billion tonne turn around and that program, which Tony started, and was followed through by Malcolm and now myself, has been very successful. So we are adding to the success of the project to meet those targets.

KENNEDY: When you are quoted as saying you will meet your targets in a canter, you were including this money? You had this in mind?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

KENNEDY: What is the difference for small business and farmers?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it’s continuing the projects that we already do. So it’s a reverse auction basically and what we’ve seen through this program is it does everything from improving soil productivity and boosting energy efficiency, assisting small businesses and their management practices. Savannah management practices and things like that for indigenous communities. It has been an incredibly successful program, both improving the economy and supporting the environment. So it has been a success and we’ll continue it.

KENNEDY: How will people in remote communities be able to hold off severe bushfires was one that (inaudible)?

PRIME MINISTER: They are already doing that in terms of how they manage their burn management programs and that is part of the reverse auction process.

KENNEDY:  Haven’t they have done for a long time?

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah and this helps them continue to do that and provides an economic basis for doing so, supporting jobs in rural and regional communities, particularly for indigenous Australians, who know how to manage the land and we are backing in them on doing that.

KENNEDY: Now you are in Melbourne today to make this announcement. How much will the Victorian result from November, which climate change was a really big concern for voters, how much is that playing on your approach to climate change from now until the election?

PRIME MINISTER: I want to make some simple points.  Yes, we know of course we must address climate change and more importantly, we have been. We have been meeting our targets. We will meet those targets into the future and we have a plan to achieve that.  So when it comes to our climate …

KENNEDY:  If I can just jump in on that, from the Victorian election there was a lot of criticism and blow back from previous Liberal voters who did not vote for the Coalition in Victoria because of a lack of climate change policy.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think because of a lack of awareness of our climate change policy and I think ...

KENNEDY: It wasn't sold well.

PRIME MINISTER: What I’m saying today is we that we’ve got a very strong record of achievement. I was in New Zealand on Friday. New Zealand to meet their targets will have to buy foreign carbon credits. Under our plan we don't have to do that. We are actually achieving our abatement on our side of the line. And not only just achieving it, but we are bettering it. There are very few countries in the world that can claim a 367 million tonne better than 2020 on our targets. Our emissions reductions by 2030 will be more than 50% per person and they will be about a two-third reduction in emissions intensity by 2030. So these are serious targets but our targets are measured and balanced.

KENNEDY: Why not aim higher if things are going so well?

PRIME MINISTER: Well because it will crash the economy. It is not needed to have a higher target that will close industries and close jobs.

KENNEDY: So you won’t change your targets?

PRIME MINISTER: Labor's target at 45% would result in a loss of wages, per wage earner of $9,000 each per year. So you’ve got to have a responsible target that meets your environmental obligations, which we have been doing, but also supports our economy because our obligation to future generations is to give them a better planet, but it is also to ensure they have got an economy that supports their lifestyle.

KENNEDY: Just a couple more on the politics of this. Malcolm Turnbull said in his final press conference, that the truth is the Coalition finds it very hard to get agreement on anything to do with emissions, emissions issues and climate policy issues. Have the same problem within the Coalition of bitterly entrenched views, that are actually more Ideological than views based on engineering and economics. Are those views still entrenched?

PRIME MINISTER: This program has absolute support right across the party because it deals with things that Malcolm started also on Snowy 2.0 and we are picking up with the Marinus link with Tasmania.

KENNEDY: But are those views still entrenched in some parts?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I think the proof is the policy I am announcing today. Because this is what matters.  What matters is what you get done and our record on addressing climate change is a very strong one and we have the plans in place to achieve our next set of targets which are responsible. So whether it is the Battery of the Nation, Snowy 2.0, the work that is being done in energy efficiency, the work that is being done on our Emissions Reduction Fund, all of that is adding up to meeting our obligations and our targets.

KENNEDY: Are you better at bringing the party together on this issue than Malcolm Turnbull, is that what you are saying?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I am saying we have a clear plan based on a great track record of which Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott were key parts of putting together and driving that success.

KENNEDY: Newspoll is out today.  No big shift on those numbers. Are you surprised you that didn't get a bump following your attack on Labor on border protection?

PRIME MINISTER: No, because that was not what it is about. It was about … I mean people know many things about me but one thing I am sure they know is that when it comes to border protection I don't waiver, ever and that is why I took the strong position I did on this.  For that and that reason alone.

KENNEDY: Dr Katie Allen was pre-selected as we just mentioned in Higgins yesterday.

PRIME MINISTER: A tremendous candidate.

KENNEDY: Are you relieved given a woman was not pre-selected in Stirling.

PRIME MINISTER: Let's go to Stirling. We have Vince Connolly who is a veteran and I would be pleased to have another veteran who has served overseas for our defence forces. Three great kids.  Great family man. He is coming to join the Parliament and now we’ve got Katie who was pre-selected on the weekend. A paediatrician, a medical research scientist, a mother herself. I mean, she is an outstanding candidate as is Vince. So we are recruiting great talent to our team. It is about talent. It is about people who can come and bring their experience and credentials to my team and the fact we have got so many people signing up to our team, it gives me a great sense of confidence about the direction we are taking.

KENNEDY: But it is also about women. What is the great disadvantage of taking too few women in the Liberal Party ranks to the next election?

PRIME MINISTER: Since I became leader I think it is now 19 women that have now been selected in the both the Senate and in the House and Wendy has already joined us, taking over from David Bushby's position in Tasmania.

KENNEDY: So you are not concerned you have too few women?

PRIME MINISTER: Well what I am saying is since I have become Prime Minister the record of actually seeing women come into the ranks in very, very strong seats for the Liberal Party has been pretty good.

KENNEDY: A couple of quick ones to finish on. Labor has announced today a levy on banks. It is calling it the Banking Fairness Fund. So another fund there. Do you think it sound like a good idea?

PRIME MINISTER: The Labor Party's answer to every question. Bill Shorten’s answer to every question is higher taxes. So who is next? He has announced this today…

KENNEDY: It’s a levy on the banks to help people who are struggling in financial circumstances and can't get good advice and it is a follow from the Royal Commission, of course.

PRIME MINISTER: A good program should get support, but what we are able to do is fund Medicare to its highest rate of bulk-billing in history without it increasing people's taxes. We are able to have the highest funding for education. Increasing education funding for schools, independent and public and without increasing taxes. Bill Shorten doesn't seem to be able to do anything without increasing taxes. So its retirees, homeowners, wage earners, superannuation.  I mean they are all getting hit with Bill Shorten's tax stick. I mean that is the only stick he's got - a higher tax stick that he hits anybody, anybody who gets anywhere near him.

KENNEDY: Well ok, we will hear from the Opposition today about that issue. Just one final one, Ita Buttrose as the chair of the ABC. Would you give that the green light when it is presented to Cabinet?

PRIME MINISTER: Cabinet hasn't made a decision on this matter yet and we are considering these matters and when we have made a decision we will make an announcement.

KENNEDY: Do you think she would she be a good person for the job?

PRIME MINISTER: I don't get into commentary about things that Cabinet are considering. Do you think she would?

KENNEDY: We have been pretty positive in the newsroom this morning about Ita Buttrose being the chair of the ABC.

PRIME MINISTER: I have known Ita for a long time …

KENNEDY: But it’s not up to me, it’s a question for you

PRIME MINISTER: … and I think she's an extraordinary Australian. An Australian of the Year and there  have been few people more than Ita that I think have lifted the standards of journalism in this country and I think that says a lot about her character and her abilities.

KENNEDY: Joining the ranks of the great journalism of the ABC, it would be a nice fit, it seems. Prime Minister, thank you very much for your time.


DAVID KOCH: Prime Minister, good morning to you.

PRIME MINISTER: G’day David.

KOCH: Given this poll out today, are you disappointed with that, that you haven’t had a bounce in the polls? Because you made a big thing of the difference between your policy and also the Opposition’s in terms of Medivac and asylum seeker boats.

PRIME MINISTER: We stand by all of that because that was about the policy. We don’t want to see Australia’s border protection policy weakened and that's why we took the step we did. The polls will be the polls. West Coast was behind at half time too, David, as you’ll recall. So the hooter goes in May, at the end of the session. And so we’re focused on whether is our stronger economy plans, our stronger national security plans, and today of course, outlining how we will meet our 2030 emissions reductions target through the Climate Solutions Fund.

KOCH: So you honestly think you can win the next election?

PRIME MINISTER: Of course I do.

KOCH: Is it right Bill Shorten has written to you advising the Opposition front bench will be having meeting with senior public servants in the next couple of weeks to ensure a smooth transition of power?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I know that… yes, that have, they tried the same thing back in 2016. They are getting ahead of themselves. The hubris we’ve seen from Bill Shorten thinking he has already won an election I think has risen to new levels. We will follow all the normal protocols that are associated with elections and he is trying to actually over-assert what his entitlements are in this area. But that is because he is overconfident about the next election and is approaching it, I think, quite arrogantly.

KOCH: Australians though are seeing all of these colleagues of yours resigning, Julie Bishop the latest one. A lot of women resigning from the Party. A lot of Australians are thinking wow, have they have seen the writing on the wall? Are they are getting out early and getting new jobs before the inevitable?

PRIME MINISTER: No and Julie Bishop said exactly the opposite, as did Kelly O'Dwyer. And yesterday, we preselected Dr Katie Allen. She is a paediatrician who is also a medical research scientist working on children's health. Her victory yesterday, a very substantial one in the seat of Higgins, I think demonstrates the vote of confidence that people of real talent, women of real talent, are putting in the Liberal Party. And so they are joining our team, just as many others have been to take up these positions and in fact the retirements are no different than what happens at most elections, David. They’re consistent with that and Labor have had many women retire as well.

KOCH: But you are, you have got to admit, you are pretty short on women in your ranks. Are you looking at bringing in quotas? How are you going to rectify that, because it is not a great look.

PRIME MINISTER: Well since I became Prime Minister, we’ve has I think now 19 women selected in key roles. Whether it’s Bridget Archer down there in the seat of Bass or Jess Whelan in the seat of Lyons. We have got women coming in to the Senate replacing men who have gone out of the Senate, so we’ve seen quite a number come in over these last few months. But it is certainly an issue the Party will need to address in the future, but I’m pleased at the number of women who have stepped forward in the last six months to take on these roles, and they are high-quality and they are great candidates and they are there absolutely on merit.

KOCH: OK. Let’s talk about climate change. You're unveiling your plan to tackle climate change today, including allocating $2 billion over ten years for practical solutions to reducing emissions and making sure we meet our Paris Agreement target in 2030. You can understand people get a bit confused about the Coalition’s climate change policy. Are you a climate change believer?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes. Three things. First of all, we owe it to future generations to address this issue, and we have been addressing this issue. Our record, when we came into government, we had to make up for a 700 million tonne deficit on carbon emissions when we came to government. The policies we have put in place to meet our 2020 targets means we will now beat that by 400 million tonnes. The policies we have put in place are working, they are hitting our targets. There are very few countries in the world that can say that they will not only meet our 2020 targets but exceed them.

KOCH: So why are you spending an extra $2 billion if you are reaching the target comfortably? Are you going to set new lower targets?

PRIME MINISTER: No, the 2020 targets are the one we're going to meet by over 400 million tonnes. The 2030 targets will require this additional investment in the very programs that have been…

KOCH: So you are a bit behind on that?

PRIME MINISTER: No, no, we always knew that there would be more that needed to be done and I have said that on several occasions and I said we’d be announcing that before the election. And today, I’m making those plans clear. These are responsible targets, David. I believe that you can meet your emissions reduction targets, address climate change and not put a sledgehammer through your economy. That is why our targets are balanced. They will reduce per capita emissions by more than 50 per cent by 2030 and our emissions intensity by two thirds. Now, that is one of the best targets in the G20. Countries like Canada won't meet that. Countries like New Zealand will not meet that same level of result and they will have to buy carbon credits from overseas. We are dealing with it on our side of the line, making sure we are taking the action that is needed.

KOCH: So this Climate Solutions Fund is the renamed the Emissions Reduction Fund?

PRIME MINISTER: No it’s more than that, because there is the work being done on Emissions Reduction Fund, there is the investment that will be going into Snowy Hydro 2.0 and also the Battery of the Nation project, another pumped hydro very significant project in Tasmania. It also deals with electric car strategy and on top of that, continuing with the energy efficiency measures whether it's in households or businesses. So it’s a comprehensive package.

KOCH: It sounds like you like renewables and renewable energy has a real place in this?

PRIME MINISTER: Well of course it does. So does reliable energy. I mean, I don’t… as my predecessor used to say, these things don't have moral qualities, they just produce energy that people need to use, so I don't get hung up on personal affections for one or the other.

KOCH: Your colleagues slammed South Australia for their batteries and renewable energies.

PRIME MINISTER: I just want stuff that works, David. That’s what I want to do. My plan will do that, it’ll meet our targets and it won’t put a sledge hammer through our economy. Labor's emissions reduction target of 45 per cent will cost everybody's wage $9,000 a year. $9,000 a year. That's a carbon tax on steroids.

KOCH: OK, Prime Minister, thank you for talking to us this morning. Appreciate it.


DEBORAH KNIGHT: Scott Morrison joins us now from Melbourne, good morning to you.

PRIME MINISTER: Good morning Deb.

KNIGHT: Now you’ve gone in hard over the past fortnight to try and discredit Labor on border protection. This Newspoll though shows things haven’t shifted. Why do you think your message isn’t cutting through?

PRIME MINISTER: We’re just doing the right thing for Australia’s borders. That's why we are doing this. We have always been strong on this issue, and I take great issue, whether it is the Labor Party, the Greens or anyone else, who want to undermine the strong border protection that we have put in place. That's why I acted on it, Deb, and that's why I will always act on it.

KNIGHT: You have been accused of scaremongering on this issue. Do you think that that’s not cutting with voters?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I know what the accusations are. I was accused of that when the boats were turning up thick and fast when we were in Opposition and people said I wouldn't be able to, as a team, turn it around. But we did. So that was an important thing for us to do as a nation. So I don't get swayed by those sort of criticisms. I just do what's right for the country and what’s right for our borders.

KNIGHT: Now, you are taking the fight to Labor on the issue of climate and your Party we know has been tearing itself apart on this for years. It has brought down leaders on both sides of politics. How do you come up with a united policy on climate change when some within your own ranks appear to doubt that it is even real?

PRIME MINISTER: We have one and we have been achieving it is. It is a right thing to do for future generations. The plan that we have been working to has taken where we inherited a 700 million tonne deficit on carbon emissions for the 2020 targets and we are now going to beat that by more than 400 million tonnes. And the core of that success has been the Emissions Reduction Fund and we are putting more money into that over the next decade to meet our 2030 targets. But it is not just that, it’s the work we are doing on hydro, whether it is Snowy Hydro 2.0 or down in Tasmania with the Battery of the Nation project where I was last year with Will Hodgman and I met with him again this week and we have been working on how we can bring that project to life.

And all the work that has been done on energy efficiency, whether it is on people's roofs or within their businesses, this is what will get us to the 2030 target. And what I'm announcing today will make sure that we can do that. We are already over achieving on our targets and with our plan we will continue to meet those targets which is what matters at the end of the day. Are you getting the job done? And when it comes to climate we are getting the job done on the targets that have been set and they are responsible targets as well as real and credible targets.

KNIGHT: Because I guess that would make people why we need to spend another $2 billion to get there, because you have said in the past as you have said now we will meet those Paris targets by 2030, and you used the language in a canter, so why do we need to do this spending?

PRIME MINISTER: And we will, Deb. Deb, I always knew we were going to put these policies in place and I was very clear about that all the way through and these are the policies that will continue to get us there in 2030. And they are built on the success of what we have achieved to date and they carry that success through to make sure we can achieve it by 2030. Now, we won't be do it by buying foreign carbon credits using taxpayer's money. Other countries will be doing that. New Zealand just confirmed to me last Friday that's what they will have to do. We will be reducing our missions on our side of the line, but we’ll be doing it without putting a wrecking ball through the Australian economy. I mean, Labor's 45 per cent emissions reduction target will cost everyone’s wage $9,000 a year. That's what the independent assessment came out and said last week. That's a carbon tax on steroids. We won't be doing that. Our target reduces the intensity of emissions by two thirds by 2030 and emissions per capita by over 50 per cent. We will achieve all of that. We will be doing our bit but keeping the economy strong at the same time.

KNIGHT: We know how crucial credibility and authenticity is in politics and you were the Treasurer who came into Question Time with a lump of coal talking up fossil fuels. I guess the big question for voters is how can they trust you to turn things around on climate policy?

PRIME MINISTER: Because our policies have been working. We need to draw our energy from all sources, Deb, all sources. And we need reliable power, as well as renewable, and in many cases, like with hydro, it is both and that's why we are investing in those areas. But I'm not going to join the Labor Party who sees the global market for our biggest mineral export facing some real problems as being wonderful. The Labor Party has said to 55,000 people who work in the coal industry that your jobs don't mean anything to us. Now, I know that would be a terrible message for people to hear up in Townsville. They are already dealing with the floods, and now they have got a Labor Party who wants to take their jobs away.

KNIGHT: All right, Prime Minister, time is unfortunately against us as always. There is lots more to talk to you about. But we hope to have you back on the show again soon. We thank you for your time this morning.

PRIME MINISTER: Well thank you very much for joining us here today. Can I also acknowledge the Boon Wurrung of the Kulin Nation, the land on which we meet. Can I acknowledge elders past and present and emerging.

Can I also take the time to acknowledge all the people who are gathered with us here today. Of course, I want to also acknowledge David Kemp. Doctor Kemp, it’s great to have you here because today we speak of a tradition the Liberal Party’s commitment to doing what is practical and what is right for our environment. And no one better encapsulated that than yourself in that role so many years ago, like so many others.

And of course you are joined by other great environment ministers in Greg Hunt, my good friend, and Josh Frydenberg, who have also taken on those roles. And of course today’s Environment Minister Melissa Price who is with us here today and has been integral to what I’m announcing today. And Melissa, I want to congratulate you on the great work you have been doing on the portfolio as we’ve come to make these important announcements that we are today.

And Angus Taylor is here as well, he has also been a key part of our team as we’ve pulled all of this together and particularly when we’re talking about issues around Snowy 2.0 and the hydro projects in Tasmania.

Can I also acknowledge Jane Hume and James Paterson who are here and can I also particularly acknowledge these powerhouse candidates. We’ve got Gladys Liu.

[Applause]

Of course, Kate Ashmor here in Macnamara.

[Applause]

And a very, very, very special welcome to Doctor Katie Allen.

[Applause]

And congratulations on your selection yesterday.

What this says to me when I look at the calibre of our candidates here with Katie, Kate and Gladys joining the team that you see here before us. A great improvement, a sign-up to where we’re going as a Party, where we’re going as a Government.

And so to have Doctor Allen added to our number yesterday, I think was a further endorsement to that approach. And so it’s great to have you on the team, I look forward to catching up. I know you caught up with Josh last night as well and so you are very, very welcome.

But to the subject of today. It falls to each generation to provide a road map for our nation’s future. This has always been our focus as Liberals and Nationals. David understands that.

And not just a road map, but a detailed plan that sets out how we will pass the prospect of a brighter future onto the next generation of Australians.

Over the past five years, our Government has kept faith with our traditions of what we believe as Liberals and Nationals to address the many tasks that have been set before us when we came to Government five and a half years ago.

Restoring the Budget to balance, from Labor’s years of deficits, to the point where Josh Frydenberg will hand down the first surplus Budget in 12 years. That is a significant turnaround in our nation’s finances.
Reducing taxes so working Australians keep more of what they earn, for them and their families. They have more in their pockets to deal with the rising cost of living.
Securing Australia in an uncertain world. We understand the world as it is, not as we’d like it to be, because we have to deal with it as it is. There is a clarity in how we pursue these issues.
Record defence spending, stronger borders and a comprehensive plan to keep Australians safe. Whether it’s in the classroom for kids, or online with bullying and sexual predators, or so women can walk the streets and not fear the violence that is too often visited upon, particularly in this city here in Melbourne.
Guaranteeing – and fully funding – the essential services we rely on. No one knows this better than Greg Hunt. Record bulk billing for Medicare achieved under our Government.
[Applause]

Do you want a strong Medicare? I do, we all you, you need a stronger economy if you want a strong Medicare. And that’s what we’re delivering and the Pharmaceutical Benefits listings now at 2,000 since we came to Government. Changing and saving people’s lives. Well done Greg, you’ve done an extraordinary job on all of those issues.
Now, across all of those issues, the NDIS, medical care, the infrastructure that supports our quality of life.

This is what we’ve been doing. These are achievements we can be proud of.  

And they speak to why we can be trusted when we say we have a plan to make Australia even stronger.

That’s what these credentials are, that what these achievements demonstrate. That the plans we are now putting in place that you can have every confidence that they will be achieved because that is what we have done.

So today, I want to focus on our ongoing plan to address climate change, with practical solutions that reduce carbon emissions, while preserving our economic strength and our living standards.

Because you know, as Liberals and Nationals we don’t believe we have to choose between our environment and our economy.  Such an approach I consider is not measured, it’s not balanced, it’s not practical and it’s not helpful.

It pushes debate, when you think it’s an either/or choice between your economy and your environment, if that’s what you think this debate is about, you know where the debate goes? It goes to the extremes, it leads to people making reckless decisions, not balanced ones, that can have very dire consequences for our country and future generations.

So that’s not our approach, it’s not an approach that a sensible Government like ours embraces. And that’s why we haven’t embraced that approach which says you have to choose between your economy and your environment.

We acknowledge and accept the challenge of addressing climate change, let’s be clear about that. Our Government, my Government, acknowledges that we must accept the facts of climate change, address it, and we do so with cool heads, not just impassioned hearts. Because it takes both.

Our approach is to take care of our environment but also take responsibility to ensure we acknowledge, understand and manage the consequences of the decisions that you make to address climate change.

Our actions and plans to address climate change build on our strong traditions and record of achievement as Liberals and Nationals over generations to protect, preserve and value our environment.

Now, no one politician, no one political party, no one government can claim a mortgage on understanding the obvious fact that we only have one planet. Plenty try to, but it’s just a simple truth.

It was the Menzies Government that signed the Antarctic Treaty - protecting this last frontier from mining, weapons testing, and military bases.

It was John Gorton who established the Office of the Environment, and took on the then shibboleth of ‘federal-state relations’ to ban drilling and mining on the Great Barrier Reef. An action far ahead of its time.

It was the McMahon Government that appointed the first Minister for the Environment, Peter Howson, who as Greg reminds me, led our delegation to the inaugural United Nations Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment that approved a moratorium on the commercial killing of whales, an international convention to regulate ocean dumping, and the establishment of a World Heritage Trust to help preserve wilderness areas and other science natural landmarks.

This was backed up by the Fraser Government that banned whaling in our waters, Australian waters, declaring the Great Barrier Reef a marine park, banning sand mining on Fraser Island, and making Kakadu and South West Tasmania World Heritage areas.

It was then the Howard Government that established the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target in 2000, which created incentives for investment in renewable energy.

The Howard Government established the Climate Action Partnership between the Australian and United States, initiated collaboration on climate change with Japan, and signed bilateral climate change agreements with China, New Zealand and the European Union.

It was also the Howard Government that established the Natural Heritage Trust, as David remembers very well. The Australian Greenhouse Office, passed the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and increased the green zones in the Barrier Reef Marine Park from 5 per cent to a third, 33 per cent.

And it was the Howard Government, with Malcolm Turnbull as Environment Minister, that first tackled the vexed – and it remains vexed - issue of the Murray Darling Basin and established the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, with bipartisan support I stress, that was carried on by the Rudd and Gillard Labor Governments, and we have carried on indeed as a Government with bipartisanship, it’s foundation for success. You play around with bipartisanship on the Murray Darling Basin and you really do pout all of what can be achieved in these sensitive areas at risk. You don’t play politics with the Murray Darling.

Our direct action initiative when we came to Government, commenced under Tony Abbott with Greg as its architect, enabled us to successfully meet Australia’s Kyoto emissions reduction targets, as promised.

Our Government, also under Tony Abbott, then set and confirmed a new target of 26-28 per cent emissions reductions on 2005 levels by 2030.

We established the Asia-Pacific Rainforest Partnership, knowing that about one billion tonnes of CO2 is released each year in our region as a result of deforestation and land degradation. Now this is nearly double the amount of emissions Australia produces annually from every sector of our economy combined.

We have kept our commitment to support our neighbours, including $300 million to support climate resilience projects in the Pacific.

And under Malcolm Turnbull we invested in the first stage of Snowy 2.0 and through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Renewable Energy Agency, where they made further investments in pumped hydro, battery storage and large-scale wind and solar.

Malcolm Turnbull put pumped hydro, again, back on Australia’s map from where it had been all of those years ago when Snowy was first conceived.

Our commitment and action to conserve our environment is grounded in our understanding of the intergenerational compact.

The obligation we have to future generations.

Our children should not have to pay tomorrow to subsidise the living standards and lifestyle that we enjoy today.

Now, this is as true for our environment as it is for getting the Budget back into surplus, for paying for our health and education services. We shouldn’t be borrowing from future generations to pay for the recurrent services that we today expect.

One of the biggest things that happened in the last couple of years in the Budgets is we stopped borrowing money to pay for recurrent services, be it welfare, hospitals, education, all of those everyday expenses. That stopped under our Government.

Or building indeed the infrastructure we need to support population growth.

Our air, waterways, fisheries, soils, biodiversity, our oceans, our reefs and our lands are all vital parts of the inheritance that we leave for future generations.

We hold them in trust today for those who will come after us. This is not a new concept. Indigenous Australians have been living these principles for tens of thousands of years and we acknowledge that here today.

Reducing our carbon emissions to address the real challenge of climate change requires practical policies. It’s not about armbands, it’s about policies that actually work and do things.

What matters is what works and whether you are achieving what you set out to do.

So what have we set out to achieve?  And how have we performed? These are the reasonable benchmarks, in fact the only benchmarks, that you can use to assess.

Australia’s share of the global carbon footprint is 1.3 per cent.

Now that compares to 1.6 per cent in Canada, Germany 1.9, South Korea 1.4.

China at 26 per cent and the USA at 14 per cent are the world’s largest emitters.

So that’s the playing field.

In 2015, we committed to reduce our emissions as I said by 26-28 per cent by 2030, from 2005 levels.

This percentage is higher than countries like Japan and Korea but slightly below Canada and New Zealand.

But when you dig deeper, you can see what the real nature and significance of this commitment is.

Our 2030 target is the equivalent of reducing emissions per capita by around 50 per cent - one of the largest reductions of any G20 economy.

In terms of the emissions intensity of our economy, our effort is even greater - a reduction of around 65 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.

In 2015, Australia was the 14th largest emitter. After taking into account all countries' commitments, we are on track to drop to being the 25th largest emitter by 2030.

So our target is no slouch and let no one tell you it is. It’s a fair dinkum commitment, it’s a serious commitment, that requires real effort to achieve. And we are playing our part, we are doing our bit.

But nor is our target reckless, nor is it extreme.

By contrast, Labor is proposing a 45 per cent emissions reduction target.

This requires more than three times the amount of emissions reduction by 2030, compared with our Government’s sensible and achievable target is currently pitched.

Independent modelling released last week by BAEconomics has confirmed that Labor’s reckless emissions reduction target will put, as Angus has said on so many occasions and rightly, a wrecking-ball through the Australian economy. Something the Business Council of Australia have also said in similar terms.

Now the work shows that compared to our Government’s targets, Labor’s 45 per cent reckless target and 50 per cent reckless RET will:

Cost the economy an additional $472 billion. I’m not kidding - $472 billion, almost half a trillion dollars
It’ll slash more than 336,000 jobs,
It’ll cut the average wage from what it would otherwise be by over $9,000 a year. That makes the carbon tax look like a mosquito bite. This thing is a chunk out of people’s living wage.
It’ll increase wholesale electricity prices by more than 58 per cent.
That’s not a sensible target, it’s a reckless target. And it will come at a tremendous cost to Australians.

Sure you can have them, you can have higher targets. But they come at a tremendous cost.  

A cost far worse, as I said, than the Carbon Tax Labor said they wouldn’t introduce, and then did and then our Government had to abolish. Which again Greg Hunt led the charge on.

So Labor runs around the country telling industries and businesses about their target and say ‘you’ll be exempted and you’ll be exempted‘. They go up to the aluminium smelter in Boyne Island and say we’ll exempt you and we’ll exempt you. Well, they both can’t be true. It cannot be true because if they were to do all of those things, they would have absolutely no hope of meeting their emissions reductions targets as they’ve set it out.

Their targets depend, in fact they rely on shutting industries and businesses down. You can’t achieve that any other way.

So they’re either lying about the targets they’re setting or they’re are lying about the impact on jobs, especially in heavy industries and the agricultural sector. Either way, you can’t trust Labor when it comes to this issue.

That’s why I say it is important to have balance in your emissions reductions policies – You’ve got to have the cool head as well as the passionate heart – which is our approach.

Based on our performance to date, our target is also achievable.

If you measure the success of policy by whether it achieves the objective you set for it, the success of our policies on climate change policy is clear.

Australia beat our first Kyoto 2012 greenhouse gas reduction target by 128 million tonnes.

After our election in 2013 it was our Government’s job to get Australia back on track to meet our Kyoto 2020 targets.

In November of last year, the United Nations Environment Programme released its annual Emissions Gap reporting which confirmed Australia was on track to meet our 2020 targets.

But this was no small achievement. This didn’t happen by accident, by good luck. It happened because we took important decisions and we took action.

In 2013 we inherited from Labor a 755 million tonne projected deficit on our Kyoto 2020 targets. That was our starting point. We are now expecting to over achieve on that same target by 367 million tonnes. That is a $1.1 billion, sorry 1.1 billion tonne turn around. I’m used to talking about the turnaround we’ve made on deficits – and they usually apply to the budget.

[Laughter]

But I tell you the work that Greg and Josh and Melissa have been doing in this area is just as significant. That’s what we’ve been able to achieve by our budget – when it comes to finances.

Not all other G20 countries can say this. Australia is right out ahead. Canada can’t say it about 2020. They might say they’ve got higher targets but they’re currently not meeting the targets they’ve already set. Indonesia, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, South Africa, the USA and Germany, they’re not on track to meet targets they’ve previously set – let alone exceed them.

So let’s not talk down what Australia is doing and the heavy lifting that we’ve been doing to achieve those targets and as Melissa was reminding me yesterday, they come to us when we go to these conferences – and ask us how we’re achieving this so well.

So we are in a very small club. A club that has been exceeding our targets under our policies as a Government.

And also I should stress, unlike other countries such as New Zealand and I met with Prime Minister Ardern on Friday who reminded me that they will need to meet their targets by doing business with foreign carbon traders. They will need to do it by spending taxpayer’s money on foreign carbon credits. That’s not what we are proposing today. That’s not what we are going to have to do based on the plan that I’ve set out today.

Our Government has achieved our goals through a combination of successful policy measures.

The Emission Reduction Fund, which was the centrepiece of the direct action initiative, supports farmers, landholders and Indigenous communities to deliver practical projects such as savannah fire management, energy efficiency, capturing methane from local landfills and storing carbon in soils.

So far, the Fund has contracted 193 million tonnes of emissions reduction at an average price of around $12 per tonne.  There remains around $226 million uncommitted in that Fund – and that will be used to roll out those options.

The Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) is set at 33,000 gigawatt hours by 2020. The Clean Energy Regulator (CER) has said the 2020 LRET will be met.

According to the CER, 2018 was a record year for installations of large-scale renewable power stations, Angus has reminded us of on many occasions, with more than 360 power stations representing 3,300 megawatts of capacity completed and beginning generation.

That’s a lot of power.

This comfortably exceeded the record of around 1,000 megawatts that was set in 2017.

Now forgive me for going into such length and into so much detail today so early in the morning but I think this is important to set out the facts when it comes to our action on climate change – and so I pray your indulgence because I’ve got a bit to get through yet. Because there’s a lot we’ve been doing.

The CER has forecast another record (of around 4,300 megawatts) in 2019.

Now the CER has not yet published data for rooftop solar installations in 2018, but has forecast it will be in the order of 1,600 megawatts, which will comfortably break the 1,100 megawatts record set in 2017. One in five Australian households have rooftop solar and this is expected to grow to one in four over the next four years.

The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) continues to invest in renewable, energy efficiency and low emissions technologies, including energy storage and electric vehicles. It is the largest organisation of its kind in the world today investing in clean energy, with countries lining up, as Melissa reminded me again yesterday, looking to learn from its success.

The CEFC has committed $6.4 billion in finance to over 110 projects across the country and around $3.6 billion remains for future projects.

ARENA provides grant funding to emerging renewable energy and enabling technologies (including energy storage). It supports projects at the research, development and demonstration stage of the innovation cycle.

ARENA has provided over $1.4 billion in grant funding to 441 projects, and around $350 million remains for future projects.

Under the National Energy Productivity Plan, the NEPP as they like to call it. They’ve got as much like for acronyms as the defence industry in the environmental sector. The minimum energy performance standards or energy rating labels apply to 20 residential, commercial and industrial equipment’s and appliances, including refrigerators, washing machines, commercial chillers and industrial motors.

This is all really practical stuff.

These standards are saving households, on average, between $90 and $190 per year on their energy bills. Over 2001-14, they reduced Australia’s emissions by around 29 million tonnes.

So it’s a win win.

The Commercial Buildings Disclosure scheme requires owners or landlords to measure and disclose the energy efficiency of commercial office space to prospective buyers and tenants. By driving improvements in commercial building energy efficiency, the scheme is projected to save owners and tenants almost $100 million on their energy bills over 2010-2019.

The CEFC has provided $170 million in concessional finance towards the construction of energy efficient community housing. This is incredibly important.

 

On the back of our success in reducing ozone, we have legislated the phase-down of ozone depleting HFCs, the potent greenhouse gas used in refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.

Our phase down - 85 per cent by 2036 - is ahead of the global response, yet again, agreed under the Montreal Protocol.

The Australian Government’s carbon neutral certification is also helping businesses voluntarily reduce and offset greenhouse gas emissions.  

So that’s a lot, isn’t it? That is a lot.

Our task is to now meet our commitment to reduce our emissions by 26 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.

That’s the task now before us.

That is why today I am announcing the Australian Government’s Climate Solutions Package.

It is a comprehensive, fully costed, $3.5 billion plan, over the next decade, to deliver on Australia’s 2030 emissions reduction targets, and to do so in a canter, just as we have on our targets to date.

It is a plan that builds on our success that I have outlined, in comprehensively beating our Kyoto commitments.

As Liberals and Nationals we say what we will do and we just get on and we do it.  That’s our form. Whether on this issue, or any issue you care to nominate.

Unlike Labor’s plan, our policies mean we can reduce emissions while growing our economy and keeping electricity prices lower.

In 2008, official estimates suggested we would need to reduce emissions by 3.3 billion tonnes to meet our 2030 target.

Today, as you can see, that task, as a result of the actions we have taken as a government over the last five and a half years combined [inaduble], is now 328 million tonnes to reach a 26 per cent target and it’s falling. 

That is an extraordinary turnaround that we’ve been able to preside over.

To help us achieve this task, I’m announcing today a new Climate Solutions Fund, to carry forward the work of the Government’s Emissions Reduction Fund – that’s at the heart of our Direct Action Imitative when we came to government in 2013 – with an additional $2 billion investment over the next ten years.

As I mentioned, the ERF has already secured 193 million tonnes of abatement through 477 projects across Australia. This is the largest ever emissions reduction commitment by Australian businesses and landholders.

Our new Climate Solutions Fund will deliver additional practical climate solutions across the country, and it’s going to do it in partnership with businesses large and small, local communities in particular remote Indigenous communities and farmers.  

Floating everybody’s boat.

Agricultural projects will cover activities such as revegetating degraded land and increasing soil carbon to improve farm productivity and resilience.  This not only reduces emissions but has clear economic advantages as well, in many cases providing much needed income in farming communities.

The benefits go well beyond abatement. The purpose goes well beyond abatement. The abatement we bank. The benefits of improved productivity in a growing economy, stronger local and regional communities, we bank that to.

Under the existing ERF, soil carbon sequestration projects are being conducted across a number of properties, including right here in Victoria.

We’ve shown what can be achieved working with remote Indigenous communities to reduce the risk of severe bushfires.  Late season wildfires produced over 50 per cent more carbon emissions than controlled burning early in the dry season.

On Fish River in the Northern Territory, Indigenous rangers are working with conservation groups to introduce traditional, traditional I underscore, early dry-season burning practices, in the process reducing methane and nitrous oxide emissions released by savannah wildfires.  

Other areas of focus under the new Fund include support for local communities to reduce waste and increase recycling rates.

Melissa Price, as Minister for the Environment will work with stakeholders to build greater co-benefits into program design under the Climate Solutions Fund, including biodiversity, water quality, Indigenous employment, recycling and productivity improvements.

It goes well beyond abatement. Melissa will be driving that cause to ensure the multiple dividends that can be achieved from this significant investment.

The Government will also improve the operation of the ERF Safeguard Mechanism, to reduce costs for business and make it fairer and simpler.

The Climate Solutions Fund will deliver an additional 103 million tonnes of greenhouse gas reductions by 2030.  This represents almost a third of the amount of reductions needed to meet our target.

The second pillar of our Climate Solutions Package is Australia’s renewable hydro-electricity reserves in the Snowy Mountains and Tasmania. Renewable and reliable.

We will continue the work of turning world class renewable hydro into Australia’s largest batteries.

These reserves are world class. I’ve seen them myself. They already deliver low cost renewable electricity to millions of Australian families and businesses.

We have a once in a generation opportunity to redesign our world class hydro assets into new pumped hydro stations. Pumped hydro can deliver 24/7 round-the-clock renewable and reliable power.

It is used extensively and effectively overseas, but not on a wide scale basis here in Australia.  Almost all energy storage capacity in the United States is supplied by pumped hydro; a technology that can be some 50 times less expensive in supplying electricity compared with lithium batteries.

We will shortly make an announcement on our investment in Snowy 2.0, initiated by Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister.  Today I want to detail our plan, working with the Tasmanian Government, to deliver additional reliable, zero-emissions electricity generation to mainland Australia.

Our Government will commit $56 million, right now, this year, to fast track the development of a second electricity transmission interconnector – the MarinusLink – to unlock Tasmania’s Battery of the Nation.

The Battery of the Nation is expected to deliver up to 2,500 megawatts of reliable, renewable hydro power to Tasmania and Victoria - including up to 16 gigawatt hours of storage.

Through the MarinusLink, the Battery of the Nation is also expected to reduce national emissions by 25 million tonnes by 2030.

MarinusLink will enable over 400 megawatts of existing – it’s right there, right now – existing dispatchable, reliable generation to be transmitted here into Victoria; power currently unavailable due to limited BassLink interconnector capacity. 400 megawatts is enough to power up to 400,000 homes.  

The type of reliable generation was sorely needed during the recent Victoria heatwave when lack of access to reliable baseload power caused major black-outs across this state.  

Subject to development of the business case and funding arrangements, we expect the MarinusLink to be able to supply Victorians with electricity from 2025.  It will also open up opportunities for intermittent renewables in Northern Tasmania.

The construction of the Marinus Link is expected to generate between 500 and 1000 jobs during construction in Tasmania and between 900 and 1500 jobs in regional Victoria.

Ultimately, MarinusLink and Battery of the Nation mean lower prices, greater energy security particularly for Tasmania, Victoria as well as other mainland states, while helping Australia achieve its 2030 emissions reduction target.

I want to thank Premier Hodgman and Guy Barnett, the Energy Minister in Tasmania for the great work they’ve been doing with Angus and myself and Josh as we’ve been working through the details in recent times.

Premier Hodgman has a great vision for the Battery of the Nation project. We share his vision and we are investing in it as I’ve announced here today.

Now other measures to lower emissions – there are three other parts of our Climate Solutions Package and I’ll touch on them briefly.

The Government will make a substantial investment in helping households and businesses improve energy efficiency to support practical action on emissions while also delivering lower energy bills.  

Energy ratings labels on appliances and equipment allow consumers to compare the running costs of different models and the financial savings of buying a more efficient appliance. Giving them the tools they need.   

The Australian Government will work with industry and state and territory governments to also expand the Energy Rating Label.

We will also cooperate with other governments and industry to improve energy efficiency standards for both commercial and residential buildings.  Through the Climate Solutions Package, we will provide resources, training and tools to help commercial and residential building owners and occupiers reduce their energy use.

Taken together, these measures are expected to reduce emissions by 63 million tonnes by 2030.  We will have more to say on the detail of those measures shortly.

The Government is developing a National Electric Vehicle Strategy to ensure the transition to new vehicle technology and infrastructure is carefully planned and managed.

Through that Strategy the Government will investigate mandating an electric vehicle plug type to improve the consistency and interoperability of public charging.

It’s got to be practical. It’s got to be [inaudible]

Our goal is to secure benefits for all Australians in the form of cleaner air, better health, smarter cities, lower transport costs and, of course, lower emissions.  

This Strategy is expected to yield up to around 10 million tonnes of abatement.  It will build on the work of the COAG Transport and Infrastructure Council, as well as support through ARENA and CEFC.

Finally, we are also committed to continue to work on cleaning and greening our communities through Landcare and other community grants to support local communities taking practical action to reduce emissions, improve air and water quality, protect the environment and make Australians healthier.

I saw that for myself in Gippsland yesterday when I was meeting with local Landcare workers on the ground in dealing the drought there in Gippsland.

There is further impetus coming from technological change and improved efficiency, ensuring Australia is well placed to achieve our targets.

In the 2018 Australian Emissions Projections report, Australia’s task to reach its 2030 target, as I said, has fallen to 328 million tonnes – that included an improvement of 173 million tonnes on the back of technology changes, improved productivity and other sources of abatement.

We’re on the curb. We’re on the path with many of these other things that are happening and that will ensure we were able to reach our targets.

On conservative estimates, more than 100 million tonnes is expected from these ongoing abatement sources, including as a result of investment of unallocated funds in the CEFC, faster uptake of technologies such as improved refrigeration and air conditioning equipment standards and the ERF safeguard mechanism.

So in conclusion.

Our Government will take, and is taking, meaningful, practical, sensible, responsible action on climate change, without damaging our economy or your family budget.

This has always been our pledge. It’s what we said when we were elected in 2013 and we’ve been delivering on it. It’s our record. It remains our commitment.

Our Climate Solutions Package will ensure Australia meets our 2030 emissions reduction target in a canter - a responsible and achievable target - building on our success in comprehensively meeting and beating our Kyoto commitments to date.  

We’ve got the record.

By 2030, we will have slashed the emissions intensity of our economy by two-thirds compared with 2005. That’s no slouch of a commitment or achievement- a truly remarkable one given our country’s size, population density, growth profile and economic strengths in agriculture and resources.  

We will continue to play our part in meeting the global challenge of climate change in the 21st century – and we can hold our head up high in what we are doing. And we will not, and I will not allow others to talk down what Australia is achieving in this area.

Australians have been working very hard on this issue led by a Government with practical policies and I will not have their efforts talked down and degraded. They are doing a tremendous job – both a passionate heart and a very clear and cool head.

And so we’ll do that without taking a sledgehammer to our economy.

Without putting our electricity market at risk.  Without putting pressure upward on electricity prices. Without destroying jobs in our traditional industries and in regional Australia.

This is the responsible and balanced course. Today I have set out how we’re going to meet our targets.

Our targets are sensible and practical. People may disagree with what our targets are. But today I believe I have set out why they are credible, responsible, achievable targets.

I’m yet to see that from the Labor Party. I’m yet to see how they plan to achieve their target which will require three times what you can see there on that chart.

And for them to be honest about the impact on jobs. About the impact on agriculture. On our minerals and resources sector. Our forestry’s sector. All of which support Australian’s livelihood.

Labor are not telling you the truth about their plans. They’re either lying to you about what they are claiming to be wanting to do or they’re lying to you about what the impact of that will be.

I’m being straight up with you. Absolutely straight up. We know what the target it. I’ve set out the way to get there.

Our team will meet that target because we have the plans and commitment in place. And at the end of the day, that’s what matters. Being able to deliver on what you say you are going to do.

Whether it’s on addressing climate change, addressing our economic challenges, addressing our national security challenges. We are saying clearly what we’re going to do – and how we’re able to achieve it which is why you can trust us. To do what we say we are going to do.

And that is why we must stay the course.

Thank you very much for your time.DOORSTOP - HOBART AIRPORT, TASMANIA

SENATOR THE HON ERIC ABETZ: Today's announcement is exceptionally exciting for southern Tasmania, but indeed all of Tasmania. It builds on the good economic management that has been delivered by the Coalition Government over the last few years. The Premier and I still recall the 2013/ 2014 period when this state was in recession, was going backwards, and as a Federal Coalition, we promised to turbo charge the Tasmanian economy.

The Coalition was elected federally, shortly thereafter the Liberals were elected in Tasmania. And we have worked hand in glove ever since to ensure that we deliver good economic management to Tasmania. And the statistics are there for all to see. The Premier and his Treasurer have a great trade record for Tasmania, as we do federally. Unemployment down from 8.1 per cent to below 6 per cent. These are the sort of things that are transformational for this state.

And it's very apt that today, with the signing of the Hobart City Deal, we are here at the Hobart Airport. In 2013, as part of our policy to turbo charge the Tasmanian economy, we agreed to extend the Hobart runway. That has been delivered on time and I might add below budget and as a result, we are able to make these further announcements today. As a Tasmanian Liberal Senator along with my colleague Senator Jonathon Duniam, this really is a very exciting moment to see all this hard work after the past five years come together in this Deal which now allows us, if I can borrow a term from you, Premier, to take Tasmania to the next level. And with that, allow me to introduce the Premier.

WILL HODGMAN, PREMIER OF TASMANIA: Thanks, Eric. Prime Minister and federal colleagues and to Treasury Government and our state team and also to the Lord Mayor and our local governments colleagues as well as many other distinguished guests, it's an appropriate moment to celebrate the culmination of a lot of hard work, but I think a really great example of all levels of government coming together to plan strategically for growth, to deal with challenges that come with a growing economy, and most importantly to invest in ways that will turbocharge not only the City of Hobart, but also our state.

I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the mayors and the work that they've done. This is a really important collaboration and they inform part of this greater Hobart that is really a different place now that it was just a few years ago. Tasmania's economy, now one of the strongest performing in the country. We’ve seen strong levels of population growth, a lot of business investment, and we need to match that with government investment and infrastructure.

This is a wonderful way to capitalize also on our great competitive advantages. Our role and our status as the nation's gateway to Antarctica will be enhanced by this extraordinary deal. And that will further lead to growth in that important sector and at this airport for Tasmania's exporters, for our tourism industry, for those of us who need to travel out of Tasmania. And to those we welcome here in increasing numbers, to have this airport restored to international status is something that's been a dream of mine and this government for many years. This is a massive investment that will secure Tasmania's international status and we really welcome that.

In conclusion, I just want to take the opportunity to acknowledge my Treasurer and Minister for Local Government Peter Gutwein, who's not only been pivotal in ensuring that Tasmania's budget is in such great shape, our economy is firing on all cylinders, but has put in aa power at work into this City Deal. He's been the lead minister for the state government, so thanks very much to you and for your efforts working very closely with Alan Tudge and I'm delighted to again, welcome the Prime Minister back to Tasmania very swiftly after his last visit. I know we'll see a lot more of you over the coming weeks. But great to have you back PM.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you, Premier. It's wonderful to be back here, Premier, and to be back in the turnaround state. I've said it many times and you are taking it to the next level. And I can also extend my good morning, because it is a beautiful morning here in Hobart today, to my federal colleagues, my state colleagues, and those from local government as well. This is a partnership which we're announcing here today. We have signed it here today. 

You can do a lot when you've got a strong economy. If you don't, you can't. That's the lesson, I think, whether it's in Tasmania or Australia, when you've got an economy which is strong, you can do a lot of things. And today we're announcing the Hobart City Deal, which we'll sign here today. But today I can also say because of a strong economy, we're announcing that from the first of April of this year, any Australian will be able to get their heart check-up and they'll be able to do that on Medicare and there is no cap on the amount of money that we'll put on it. It's unlimited. That's what our commitment is today. You do that because you've got a strong economy. 

We’re also announcing today that we are listing further drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, in this case that will be the pharmaceuticals associated with leukemia and leukemia-fighting, life-saving drug. These are the things you can do, taking a $7,000 drug down to a $40 drug and $6.50 if you’re on a concession. And that's to fight leukemia. That's on top of what we've done with lung cancer and breast cancer and ovarian cancer. All of these incredibly important things.

Today we're also announcing more than $200 million in research to fight heart disease in Australia. This is what you can do with a strong economy. And it's also what you can do here in Hobart with this City Deal that we’re announcing today. I share the Premier's joy and enthusiasm in terms of particularly what this Deal is doing for Hobart International Airport. It has been the dream of the Premier and one we've been very pleased to partner with him on to realise. This is great for Hobart. Make no doubt, but it's great for all of Tasmania. Whether it is Jess Whelan who is here with us or Bridget Archer up in Bass or anywhere across the state, this is a good deal for the state. It's just not about Hobart down in the south. It's about all of Tasmania and I know that's why the Premier is also so committed to this project because it is a gateway and enables all Tasmanians to benefit.

The project encompasses our environmental commitments and our research and capability that is based here on the Antarctic and the Environment Minister Melissa will say a bit more about that in a minute. It deals with everything from affordable housing through the busting congestion in our cities. It's great to see the turnaround not only in the economy, but the population of Tasmania and that requires us to invest and that's exactly what we're doing.

So it is a landmark day for Tasmania, for Hobart, and for Australia and I'm very pleased to be here with the Premier and all of our other colleagues of local, state, and federal government to get this done. Thank you. I'm going to pass you on to Alan Tudge, the architect of the Deal from the Commonwealth's point of view. Thank you.

THE HON ALAN TUDGE MP, MINISTER FOR CITIES, URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND POPULATION:  Well, thanks so much, Prime Minister and Premier and colleagues and mayors. This is a Deal worth waiting for. It is a really transformational Deal for Hobart and for Tasmania. On Friday, we announced the details of the social housing package that is going to be $30 million, 100 new public houses for Hobart, which will assist the most disadvantaged in our community, including those who have escaped from domestic violence.

Yesterday was congestion busting day. We announced hundreds of millions of dollars for projects across the greater Hobart region. And that included $461 million for the Bridgewater Bridge, the single largest investment in Tasmania's history. And today we're announcing the rest of the deal and obviously with the two leaders signing it. And that's the most important elements of the deal itself is exactly as the Prime Minister said. And that is the opening up of this airport behind us to be an international airport.

Now that comes about from many things. We've already extended the runway thanks to $38 million which we put in a couple of years ago. We're investing in the gateway coming into the airport. But today we're announcing $82 million to be able to put the security in place, the migration settings in place, for people to be able to come in as an international airport. Now this means that from 2020, it'll be open for business.

Now when you look at other airports, and just recently we did this to the ACT Airport, it has led to in the ACT, a 20 per cent increase in international travellers in just two years since we opened up international airport there. And so the possibilities for Tasmania are exactly the same. And we hope that this will mean more international visitors are able to fly directly into Hobart and visit the whole of Tasmania and add to the tourism economy there. Overall that will add, we estimate, at least 680 jobs in the process.

The other key component that we're announcing today as well is the enormous contribution, which we've along with the Tasmanian government will be making towards creating what will undoubtedly be the world's best Antarctic and Science Precinct down at Macquarie Point. And that is an unbelievable vision which the Premier has articulated and we are joining him on that today. And that's going to be complemented by a $450 million investment in Antarctic research and work, which we've done in part with the University of Tasmania. And Melissa will say a couple of things about that.

Can I just conclude, though, in just in thanking the Tasmanian government, in particular Treasurer Gutwein for his work in working so closely with me along with the mayors, the four mayors involved in this. It has been a long journey, but it's been worth the wait. And it's been great cooperation across the three levels of governments and when you have the three levels of government working closely together as we have to produce a Deal like this, it's just amazing what you can achieve. So thank you so much to the Premier, to Treasurer Goodwin, and to the mayors for all the work that they've done here as well.

THE HON MELISSA PRICE, MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT: Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. And can I just say first thing, happy 50th birthday to Casey Station. It's great to be here. It's wonderful to have an invitation to Tasmania. Complementary to the Hobart City Deal is the $450 commitment over ten years to Australia's Antarctic presence. The key infrastructure, whether it's water, whether it's power, improving communications, improving research facilities, improving administration. This is in addition to our existing commitments to the Antarctic, including a  $1.9 billion icebreaker which due for delivery in 2020 and also other key infrastructure like an all-weather airstrip. 

This is good news clearly for Tasmanian businesses, the local people of Hobart, but all around Tasmania and this just shows us what we can do with a strong economy. So I'm thrilled that we've got $450 million commitment to improving our Antarctica facilities, good for Tasmanians, good for Australia. Thank you. I'd like to introduce the Lord Mayor of Hobart.

ANNA REYNOLDS, LORD MAYOR OF HOBART: Thank you, I’d just like to introduce the other three mayors that are involved in the greater Hobart area, Doug Chipman from Clarence, Kristie Johnston from Glenorchy and Dean Winter from Kingborough. The four mayor of greater Hobart are really pleased to be signing this Deal today. And most see this Deal as the start of a really important journey that's going to be occurring over the coming few years. Because implementation of this kind is the really important next step. There are many projects in this plan that we need to work out how we're going to continue to fund and implement and build and deliver. But all of the really key projects that are important for Hobart's future are in this plan. We're excited about that.

I personally am very excited about the investment in Antarctic science because any investment in Antarctica is good for Hobart. Hobart is the capital of Antarctica and it is great to see this investment in Antarctic science. It's the beginning of the journey. We've got a lot more work to do. And we’re really keen for the first time as four mayors to be working much more closely together, but also working closely with the state and federal government and they're very supportive of the concept of city deals because it is about all levels of government working very closely together. The community wants to see us working together. They don't want to see division. They want to see collaboration for the community. And so city deals are a good project and a good initiative from that perspective. Thank you.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you, Lord Mayor. What I suggest we do is why don't we address if there are any questions about the City Deal itself and there's quite a cast that can take those questions from you today and we'll direct those to the appropriate place. And if there are other matters, I suspect others who are already directly associated with the City Deal, we'd be happy to excuse them and I'm happy to deal with any other matters of the day. So, the topic.

JOURNALIST: Is there any investment for UTAS’ STEM building to come to the city?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, I’ve got to say, we've got the Vice Chancellor, and I’ve got to commend UTAS for the tremendous work they've been doing. As you know, UTAS was the beneficiary of $150 million as part of the Launceston City Deal. They have also made a tidy profit [inaudible]. And they receive around $400 million each year when it comes to Commonwealth payments. And they've got over $1 billion of capital of which they can leverage and pursue. There are many opportunities, which I have no doubt the Vice Chancellor will be very expert in opinions of. So that is not something that is part of this Deal. We think that's something that obviously, though, they'll be able to pursue in their own capacity and they've been significant beneficiaries of the deals we've already done.

JOURNALIST: Similarly, there's a concern there's no real commitment to light rail, which many see as the key to unlocking Hobart's traffic congestion.

THE HON ALAN TUDGE MP, MINISTER FOR CITIES, URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND POPULATION:  Well I addressed this point yesterday, I don’t know if the Premier or the Treasurer wants to add anything.

WILL HODGMAN, PREMIER OF TASMANIA: I might invite Treasurer Gutwein to make some comments

THE HON ALAN TUDGE MP, MINISTER FOR CITIES, URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND POPULATION:  I addressed this point yesterday, in terms of it was a huge congestion busting package which we announced, including $25 million to go into the northern corridor. And what I mentioned was that really this Deal is the first step in having better public transport solutions for that northern corridor. And there's a commitment to investigate what the best option is going to be going into the future, knowing that we need to activate that corridor, do the better planning, have the development options on the table, get rid of the red tape, and do all the pieces along the way as well.

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible] 

PETER GUTWEIN, TREASURER OF TASMANIA: Obviously there's a congestion busting piece to this [inaudible]. More importantly, what this also provides in the Deal is the first steps to be taken respectively with all the planning that needs to occur that could unleash hundreds of millions of dollars of urban development on those transport corridors. So it's the first step, the first stage, but importantly, there's $25 million under the Deal that will enable us to do that.

JOURNALIST: How much of the $1.43 billion or whatever it is actually budgeted for now?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I’ll tell you, it’s all in our forward estimates. It’s all in there. This isn't a promise. This is an actually funded commitment. It's actually in place. When it comes to commitments that are made around the election, they will be made at the time of the election being called and subsequent to that. Everything that I'm announcing all around the country, as I have been since becoming Prime Minister last year, all of that is fully committed in the budgets and in the forward estimates. So that's real money. So it’s a fair question, I suppose, to put to our counterparts. Will they reverse the funding that we’ve put in place? I would certainly hope not. But my plan is to ensure they aren't given the opportunity.

JOURNALIST: This airport is getting busier and busier. We will have the AFP here any time soon?

PRIME MINISTER: As soon as there's international flights, yes.

JOURNALIST: So that's a definite?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

JOURNALIST: Do we know when there will be international flights?

PRIME MINISTER: Once the international flights are here, that's what actually brings the two together.

WILL HODGMAN, PREMIER OF TASMANIA: And it's anticipated that by 2020, we'll be able to have international flights coming in and out of the state. Obviously there are the investments that we are talking about today that Hobart's airport also needs to undertake the master plan upgrade to also accommodate not only for the investments that are part of the city deal, but also to make sure that we have the capacity to welcome the large numbers of visitors, to get our freight exports out to the world. We've had the highest rate of growth in international tourists of any state. We've had the highest rate of growth in exports of any state over the last year. So this is a response to that growth, but we're expecting that international carriers will continue to have an interest in our state and its progress with flights expected to commence in 2020.

PRIME MINISTER: There's about $80 million that is going, or just over that actually, going into Border Force and Immigration and those types of other services that enable the Hobart Airport to be Hobart International.

JOURNALIST: Just to be clear on that, is that new money or are you taking that from somewhere else in those budgets?

PRIME MINISTER: Everything we're announcing here today is new money.

JOURNALIST: And Premier, just on the flights, we're talking about scheduled passenger flights and scheduled freight flights, is that the intention?

WILL HODGMAN, PREMIER OF TASMANIA: Yeah.

JOURNALIST: So how far down that path are you, because you've had discussions already?

WILL HODGMAN, PREMIER OF TASMANIA: Yeah, well and those discussions are ongoing. We do have high numbers of passenger movements. We've got more exporters wanting to get their product into markets right across the globe. So we're certainly building a strong case to put to international carriers and whenever we're able, we continue to keep them engaged and interested in Tasmania. We just need the infrastructure, it will take some time to deliver that. But by 2020, we expect to have those international routes coming into our state and out.

JOURNALIST: Where do you think... where will they be coming from and to?

WILL HODGMAN, PREMIER OF TASMANIA: Well there are... the opportunities abound us really and we've got strong growth in key sectors that very much have Asia at the forefront at a lot of what we're doing. But our closest neighbours where the Prime Minister's been just this week, I think, will be an obvious opportunity for us, but no doubt right across the globe.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Labor has a pledge to create…

PRIME MINISTER: If there are no other questions on the Hobart City Deal… those who wish to remain are very welcome to remain but otherwise I’m happy to go to those other matters. Is that the case from the journalists? OK, why don’t we do that.

JOURNALIST: So Labor has pledged to create a new shipping fleet to enhance Australia's national security if they win government, will the Coalition consider doing the same?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, what I find surprising about Labor'sannouncement today is that when they were in government, they didn't commission one naval ship. And they seemed to be more interested in doing what the MUA tells them to do, the Maritime Union, than what the Australian people wanted them to do and that was to actually commit to our Navy and to build our defence forces. I mean, we have the biggest naval ship building program going on since the Second World War. That's where our commitment comes to these investment and that is not only ensuring that our defence capability is back where it needs to be. I mean, the number of consecutive starts to these programs is almost unparalleled even in the United States, anywhere in the world. That is the scale of our commitment when it comes to our naval ship building. And while I can only observe from the ALP is when it comes to issues of boats, whether it's building naval ships or stopping illegal boats coming to Australia, the only thing they're interested in is what the MUA tells them to do.

JOURNALIST: Labor is saying that our Australian flagged vessels have shown that [inaudible] during times of global instability. Do you share that concern?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

JOURNALIST: Is it pure coincidence China is delaying our shipments of coal through their northern harbours or do you think it’s political?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I think the Chinese Minister said very clearly yesterday that’s not what was occuring. And I said on Friday when I was in New Zealand that leaping to those sorts of conclusions is very warranted and that the Chinese government has actually pointed that out. From time to time, there have been decisions made in local ports. And we're talking about ports here which actually represent a very small proportion of our coal exports to China. And so I think it’s very careful how they characterise these events. I don’t think… I think the great risk of that is inviting concern, particularly in our mining and resources sector. 

I was pleased to be here last weekend for two great events. One was of course the Tasmania Achievement II launch up in Burnie, which was tremendous. But also we were here to announce our forestry hub here in Tasmania. We're very committed to our traditional industries, whether it's our agricultural sector, whether it's our forestry sector, and mining for resources sector. I mean, you have the Labor Party saying it’s wonderful that the market for our biggest export is having difficulties. What does that say to people, not just get mining jobs, but in forestry jobs. What does it say to the forestry workers of Tasmania that if Labor thinks it's okay for the global market for our biggest minerals export to be going through some tough times, then how do we know they didn't feel the same about the forestry industry for the same reasons? That's why you just can't just trust Labor on jobs.

JOURNALIST: Yesterday it was published in the Australian alleging that historic child sexual abuse claims against the Tasmanian Liberal MP who was a key minister at a federal or state level. How concerning are these allegations?

WILL HODGMAN, PREMIER OF TASMANIA:  I'll make some brief comments in relation to this matter, which is a serious one and obviously given the nature of it, it needs to be dealt with appropriately. I can advise that I have written to the Tasmanian Police Commissioner to draw to his attention the article and to request that the Tasmanian Police take any appropriate action as is necessary.

JOURNALIST: What will the Liberal Party be doing to follow up these allegations?

WILL HODGMAN, PREMIER OF TASMANIA: That's the appropriate course. I'm not able to provide any further commentary in relation to this matter at this time.

JOURNALIST: To what extent are you concerned that the alleged victim in this case says that she contacted police in 2014 and made the allegations then and she heard nothing back from the police?

WILL HODGMAN, PREMIER OF TASMANIA: Well again, it's a matter that I've referred to Tasmanian Police to give consideration to obtaining the appropriate action as is required. That's what I expect will occur. And it's appropriate for that matter to be followed up through those channels.

JOURNALIST: How long have you been aware of this issue?

WILL HODGMAN, PREMIER OF TASMANIA: Since the report yesterday.

JOURNALIST: Have you spoken to the person who it’s referring to?

WILL HODGMAN, PREMIER OF TASMANIA:  Again, I've outlined the course of action, the appropriate course of action that I've taken and it is on the basis of advice I've received as well in relation to it. And that's the course of action underway, the step that I've taken.

JOURNALIST: Did you receive [inaudible]?

WILL HODGMAN, PREMIER OF TASMANIA: I take advice from appropriate offices and respond accordingly.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, thank you very much for your time. It's been great to be in Tasmania. DOORSTOP - GIPPSLAND, VICTORIA

THE HON DARREN CHESTER MP, MEMBER FOR GIPPSLAND: Well first of all, it's great to welcome the Prime Minister here today along with my colleague David Littleproud, the Minister for Agriculture, Danny O’Brien the Member for Gippsland South and Melina Bath, Upper House and  State MP as well. While it's great to be here, it's obviously a very sombre topic for us here in Gippsland. The drought is starting to bite very deeply for a lot of our dry land agriculture and the farmers we met with today make it very clear to us all that they are going through some pretty tough times. For some of our farming communities, this is the worst drought that they’ve experienced in a hundred years. So we need to keep working with them. And I've got to say I'm very pleased with the way Minister Littleproud and the Prime Minister have been responsive to the concerns I've raised about making sure we try and reduce the amount of red tape around farming household allowance and making sure we work with our local government members to try and get more infrastructure into our regional community and also work with the farming families themselves about how we can help their properties be more sustainable in the longer term. 

We all know it's going to rain again. When it rains again, we want to make sure that our farmers can be viable in the longer term. So today's about listening to our farming families, getting a better appreciation of beyond the ground impacts of the drought and what are the steps we might need to take in partnership with both state and local government to try and reduce some of those cost structures and make sure our farming families are here for a very long time. So with those words PM, it's great to have you here in Gippsland. I would have preferred you had brought nice grey skies and a couple inches of rain but if it can’t rain it might as well be beautiful like today.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks Darren. And that is the purpose of my being here today. It doesn't matter what corner of the country you are in. If you’re being affected by drought I’m listening, whether it's here at Gippsland, whether it's in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, doesn't matter where it is. Our Government is keenly interested in the plight of our rural communities. Of course those on farm, but also those who are in the towns who depend on the agricultural sector to provide the livelihood that exists right across Australia and in rural and regional centres. So it’s been a good opportunity to come here today and have a listen. It doesn't matter where I might be. The stories are different. The challenges are often different. The country is different and that means always you've got to have a very local response. And that's why a big part of our response is to work with the local shires and councils. The support that can be provided through those councils, that immediate support we've put in through our drought recovery program. That is, we know, providing some of useful support, but it's not everything. Whether it's the farm household allowance or the other measures that we've put in place, this is all important, but every single part of the country does need its own response. It does need its own plan. And that's why I’m pleased to come here today and meet with so many. 

And I'll be meeting with more later on this afternoon. I'm meeting with Premier Andrews tomorrow, we’ll be talking about a large number of topics, but this will be one and there's been some feedback here for me today, but there's also been some important feedback here today for the state and I’m sure they’ll be interested to hear my firsthand relaying of that to the state government. I know the Victorian agricultural minister has been out here and would have got it firsthand too, I imagine, got some fairly direct feedback. So we'll have those discussions when we meet together tomorrow.

But there have been some announcements today, but I'm not overstating what they are. Some of them relate to parts of this district, but others don't. And what's most important is that we ensure that how we're responding to the drought is as useful here as it is in other parts of the country. And that's principally why I've come along today. I'm going to ask David to talk a bit about some of those particular announcements, but I do stress that they don't directly impact particularly where we're standing today, but in other parts of the district they do.

THE HON DAVID LITTLEPROUD MP, MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND WATER RESOURCES: Well thanks PM. Can I firstly say, last week we saw the lowest political act in this nation's history when the Labor Party and Kerryn Phelps voted against the Future Drought Fund. To politicise the misery of these people is something I never thought I'd see in this nation. They become irrelevant to this debate. Every Australian should be ashamed that they would vote against a future fund that goes to protect regional and rural Australia, make sure that we're prepared for future droughts. For them to vote against that is the lowest political act I've ever seen. 

But we're going to get on with the job as the PM has said, and we're going to be agile, continue to be agile, we're going to come and listen. You don't want Canberra solutions, you want local solutions. So today we're proud to announce $31 million for the Macalister water project here to get greater efficiency. A project that was started 80 odd years ago and to be able to make sure we get greater efficiency to make sure there's more water available during the dry times. And so we're proud to be able to partner. We would ask the state government to consider kicking the tin with us, but we're also not just looking at irrigation. We're looking for those farmers that are out there doing it tough that don't have access to irrigation. We're also announcing on-farm order measurements, measure efficiency programs up to $25,000 or 25 per cent the Federal Government will kick in and that will allow farmers to desilt dams. To get in there while things are dry now and desilt those dams or put in pipes and troughs to get greater water efficiency. And I’d also reach out to the state government and ask them to kick the tin as well. In other states they're doing it. This'll be a real, tactile program that will give real results to farmers on the ground while they have the opportunity to do it now. But while cash flow is tight, it will be an opportunity to help them make these strategic investments in the here and now.

PRIME MINISTER: I'm happy to take some questions and we’ve got others who can field some of those questions as well. Let's just talk about what we’re here today about. I’ve already done a press conference early in the day on broader matters. I can take one or two on that if you insist, which I’m sure you will. So why don't we deal with the issues we’re here to talk about today and Darren and David and others can jump in. 

JOURNALIST: What was some of the feedback you received?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I think one of... there were two key thing that seem to be really impacting at the moment. There’s obviously an impacts on cash flow and there the fodder transport and fodder subsidies that are being provided by state governments elsewhere aren’t being provided in Victoria. And that's a real issue of concern. Rate relief as well is another big issue. And again, that's an issue that is a state matter. Look, so I’ll pass those on to Dan tomorrow. I'm sure he's quite aware of those. He would have got the same big feedback when his ag minister was out here over the course of the week. We'll do the things that we can do and David is, as I think just set out what they are.

I mean two of the biggest areas of success in providing relief that we've found in our response to the drought. And this was also backed up at our Drought Summit last year. And then the follow on from that has been the support we've put in the councils and the support we’ve put on for the on-farm infrastructure. These two things have, as we've got the feedback from farming communities all across the country, they have been working well. Now, they are being rolled out here as well now. And the other issue is how long will this go on for? And I think there is a natural and understandable anxiety about what you're planning. How long is a piece of string, you know, in parts of the country they've been a drought for seven years. We're not down that far down the road here compared to those parts of the country. 

So I think there's a natural anxiety about how much you can do and what you're trying to prepare for it. So you know, the farm household allowance, we didn't get a lot of feedback on that today, but we've got the rural financial counsellors, they’re the support people if you need that. I think David can update on how many people…

THE HON DAVID LITTLEPROUD MP, MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND WATER RESOURCES: About 380. 

PRIME MINISTER: About 380 in this part of the world who are getting support on that and if others need it then the rural financial counsellors can come and assist you with that. Darren's office can support you in making sure you get access to that. The other thing we put in is support for the mental health services locally. Again, that has to be driven locally, that I would only ask all of those in the district to keep an eye out for each other. That's very important. It doesn't matter what time of the country you’re in, people tend not to volunteer how they're feeling about this stuff. That's, you know, it's, people are tough and they certainly like to be seen that way. But know that people are there to support you and help care for you and these services can just help you deal with a really tough time. So we're putting additional supportive of that but it's not the whole solution. It's just part of the support network that’s needed.

JOURNALIST: The Victorian Farmers Federation, the Wellington Shire Council and the East Gippsland Shire Council have all raised concerns that the criteria with the federal grant funding is too restrictive and it's not going to things that are actually helping farmers on the ground. What have you got to say to those concerns? 

PRIME MINISTER: Well one of the biggest things that Wellington done has been doing water cartage, which has had a great response and that was one of the pieces of feedback that we've had. Remember that the million dollars we give to the council is not there as the entire response to the issues facing farmers on the land. That's where the on-farm infrastructure incentives, that's what they're there for. That's what the farm household allowance is there for. It is not the only thing. The principle role of those funds that go into those councils is to ensure that there is money circulating in the local economy. It's as much to keep local jobs, whether they are people who previously might have been working on a farm and now can’t because the farm isn't doing the work that it was doing before, and now they can be working in other areas. I mean, we've got people in Queensland doing it with dog fences. We've got others upgrading amenity blocks, we've got some that are doing roads, others are doing water cottage. So around the country the response has been that the parameters have been quite good and the important thing is it's giving local communities the decision making about how they spend the money.

JOURNALIST: The feedback we’ve had from many farmers and councils is anger and frustration. We've got the Wellington Shire Council spending $500,000 in upgrading the sale yards and the East Gippsland Shire Council is spending $700,000 on resurfacing car parks. Farmers are wondering how does it actually help them on the ground battling the drought?

PRIME MINISTER:  I'll let Darren respond to that. But again, the million dollars to the councils is not intended as a farm subsidy. That's not its purpose. It was never designed that way. It was about understanding that all the towns [inaudible] drought affected communities, because those towns will not be getting the income from the ag sector coming in and spending in the towns. That won't be there. There'll be a cash drought in the towns because of the drought that is occurring on the properties. And so that's its purpose. And so there are many things we have to do and that's just one of the things, but Darren might want to comment. And the decisions are made locally, not by the Commonwealth.

JOURNALIST: But you approve them.

THE HON DARREN CHESTER MP, MEMBER FOR GIPPSLAND: Well thanks. And to clarify as the Prime Minister was saying, the infrastructure grants that local governments are being provided is intended to improve the infrastructure to boost local funding. I mean, I don't want to defend the East Gippsland Shire and Wellington Shire in that regard. The money they are spending is going to improve agricultural facilities for the long term. This is money that we need to spend anyway. If the council had to find it from their own rate revenue, it would be money taken from local roads, it would be money taken away from facilities. So the council, I think, has made responsible decisions to invest in their agricultural industries for longer term. We have a rich and a proud heritage in agriculture industries in Gippsland, but we also have a great future and part of that great future is having world-class lifestyle facilities for the sale of stock, making sure that we meet the animal welfare standards. And meet the expectations of the buying and the selling public. So I congratulate both councils for investing in the longer term, notwithstanding the fact that there's still more or what we can do with local state governments to address some of those social, economic and environmental issues on farm. And that's why we've been here today listening to farms concerns.

PRIME MINISTER: So what we’ve also done as we’ve rolled this program out, and Senator McKenzie has been, I think, very agile in listening to the feedback on the program. We've made a number of changes, as I have in terms of disaster payments in places that have been stricken by floods. And then one of the first things that we did in response to the Townsville floods was to pretty much straight away remove some of the paperwork requirements for people accessing those monies. And enabled us to get about $40 million out the door in about a week. So the Government, I think, has demonstrated an active ear when it comes to how these programs are rolling out on the ground. Frankly, that's the reason I'm here today. It’s to listen to some of those concerns that have come back and if the program needs to be altered, then we'll make those calls. 

JOURNALIST: I have a question for Minister Littleproud, if you mind. So some of the feedback we've been having from local contractors, so for example hay cartage contractors, say that we were talking about the red tape around the rural financial household allowance. They say despite, you know, relying on the land for their income, they don't qualify as a farmer per se for the legislation and therefore are missing out on some assistance that could really help him. Is this something that you'll take away from these meetings and maybe reconsider redrafting the legislation? 

THE HON DAVID LITTLEPROUD MP, MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND WATER RESOURCES: Well, look, obviously we are here listening and in fact I ordered a review into the farm household assistance program which was started in 2014. So it was long overdue. The reality is I've got to be honest, that is a safety net. It's a safety net for social security for people. It's not an entitlement. I have to be honest with people, but we are working through with an FHA review team to see whether we can streamline it, in terms of not only the application but in terms of how some of the income is treated so that it does in encompass an understanding of the agricultural sector better. But let me say, we'll continue to work through that and we're putting more rural financial counsellors on the ground. There was 116 RFCS staff, but I've put another 39 and we're continuing to go and listen. If there is a need for more rural financial counsellors on the ground, we'll put them in. We've been agile, the PM cut a cheque straight away when we needed an additional 39 and we'll continue to do more. 

But we're not going to make it a Canberra-based solution, it has to be a local solution. If we're asked for that, then we'll look for that. 

JOURNALIST: Can I ask you about on Aussie Farms, you wanted to revoke the charity status of Aussie Farms. What process is that at now? 

THE HON DAVID LITTLEPROUD MP, MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND WATER RESOURCES: That's totally incorrect. I have not asked for any charity to have their charitable status revoked in terms of drought. I have written, I have written... Oh, sorry. 

JOURNALIST: I’m talking about Aussie Farms, the organisation that published the locations of numerous farms.

THE HON DAVID LITTLEPROUD MP, MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND WATER RESOURCES: So obviously that's sent through to the Charities Commission. Under the provision of the Charities Commission that is something that isn't made public and I understand they're working through that process as they speak. It's not something that they would refer back to the Agriculture Minister. I understand they're working through that process, but I would hope that they would look very carefully at that. Because what this group has done is effectively putt and attack map on farmers and their homes where children. It is abhorrent. I don't think any Australian would say that is what a charity would do it. So I'll leave it to the Charities Commission. They're a reputable organization in terms of trying to sort this out. But I'd expect some action. I know everyone else would.

PRIME MINISTER: Let's do a couple of them, then we've got to get on the road. 

JOURNALIST: Are you disappointed that a female wasn’t selected for Stirling?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it was a good field and the grassroots of the party made a decision after Michael's departure. I was in Tasmania this morning and, you know, down in Tasmania, whether it's in Bass or in Lyons or in our Senate ticket and just recently replacing Senator Bushby, I think there's been about 17 or 18 now, female candidates that have been selected both for the National Party and the Liberal Party since I became Prime Minister. Whether it's the seats like Lindsay or Macquarie in New South Wales and as I’ve already mentioned the ones in Tasmania. So look at, these are issues that will continue to work on as a Party. But at the end of the day, our Party rank and file make the decisions and that’s what’s happened on this occasion our candidate there who was selected yesterday, he’s an ex-serviceman. He’s served overseas in peacekeeping missions, he’s served his country. He used to work on Julie Bishop's staff, in fact. So look, we had some excellent choices to choose from yesterday and the Party rank and file have done that for Western Australia.

JOURNALIST: The Liberal Party still has to fill seats vacated by senior MPs, including some women. How difficult is that task?

PRIME MINISTER: It’s the same task as filling any of these seats. There’s the selection in Higgins and there’ll be a selection in Curtain as well. The Party will go through its normal processes to make their selections in each case. Now I tell you one thing that won’t happen, they won’t be picked by unions. They won't be big union vote blocks just coming in and telling our Party who our candidates should be. That's how things roll in the Labor Party. That's not how it works for the Liberal Party.

JOURNALIST: Potentially thirteen weeks from here until the election, how do you feel?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, we're just focusing on the things that matter to Australians. That's why I'm here today. We are focused on ensuring our economy is strong so we can support essential services that Australians rely on. As I said earlier today, today we have said that from the first of next month, first of April I should say, there will be access to heart checks for all Australians under the Medicare system and it's unlimited, I should stress. The Labor Party's put a cap on how much can be done, ours is uncapped and that will be available to all Australians, uncapped. We're announcing today more listed medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This time dealing with leukemia, taking a drug that would cost around $8,000 I think down to just a 40 bucks, just over 40 bucks and $650 if you’re on a concession. 

Now you can't do these things unless you're investing in having a stronger economy. You can't turn up and provide support, whether it's in the flood-riven communities of North Queensland or drought savaged communities of Victoria. If you don't have a strong economy, I mean you're dipping into an empty bucket and that's what the Labor Party will offer - an empty bucket. The only time there'll be anything in that bucket is if they put their hand in your pocket and take more taxes from you. 

So running a strong economy enables us to support these important programs, whether it's in the drought affected communities, flood affected communities, essential services like on Medicare. I mean, we have the highest level of bulk billing for Medicare on record. That's what we've been able to achieve by running a strong economy and supporting essential services. So you asked me how I feel? I feel we're doing a great job focusing on the things that really matter to Australians - their economy, their security, their safety, their future, and for standing by them when they're going through stuff, which is really tough. Like they are here and like they are in many parts of the country and I think they know, all those quiet Australians out there. They don't get around being advocates, they don’t get around, you know, shouting and going to marches and all this sort of thing. They're just trying to keep their farms going. Keep their small businesses going. They're taking their kids to school and raising them. They're doing the best they can, running their lives and having their aspirations and they know I can hear them and I know exactly what they're saying and I'm totally on their side. Thanks very much.

REMARKS, LEADERS' MEETING - AUCKLAND

THE RT HON JACINDA ARDERN MP, PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND: Prime Minister Morrison, can I begin by thanking you somewhat unofficially in the middle of our engagement. We’ve just had a fantastic informal lunch, a good chance for us to catch up on some of the issues of the day and a bit of a cricket chat and of course covering off all of the issues we that have shared and mutual interests, which we will do in the course of our next conversation as well.

But it is a great pleasure to welcome you here. I will repeat again what I said at lunch, the fact that you are at an incredibly busy time in your political schedule and have just obviously had a trip also within the Pacific. The fact that you have prioritised New Zealand is significant for us and that’s a shared sentiment. We prioritise our relationship with you, you are a friend unlike any other we have. A friend and an ally, and I want to recognise that and of course the great cooperation we have in many areas which I know will continue.

But welcome and thank you for also bringing your wife Jenny. A lovely time has been had by all.

THE HON SCOTT MORRISON MP, PRIME MINISTER: Well thank you very much Prime Minister, it’s a great thrill to be here. Kia ora. It’s wonderful to be back in New Zealand, a place of great fondness for Jenny and I. She didn’t need much convincing, I can tell you that, in joining me today and I’m sure she is enjoying that.

Can I also join with you, this is a very significant day for New Zealanders, the eighth anniversary of the Christchurch earthquake all those years ago. Australians grieved and shed tears with their Kiwi cousins on that day, along with people I think all around the world. And so for us to be able to meet on that day is a sign of our friendship.

And when it comes to these meetings, it is always families first and we’re family here in the Pacific, particularly between Australia and New Zealand. So we appreciate the cooperation, particularly just in December I was in Taji visiting our troops there and quite a few of your troops too. They’re working so well together with our team there and they have been for some time. I really value that part of our partnership as well. We always turn up in these places together, always have, always will, and we thank them very much for their service.

PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND: Thank you. We did have a discussion around some of the disasters which we have had.

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.


19 Feb 2019
PRIME MINISTER: Thank you, Mr Speaker. On indulgence, I rise to acknowledge the 70th anniversary of Australia’s formal diplomatic relationship with the State of Israel and affirm our deep friendship with the people of Israel.

In doing that I welcome the Ambassador here with us in the Chamber today.

In any long friendship, there are moments that matter.

And moments never forgotten.

For Australia and Israel, it was in 1947, and it was at the United Nations.

There was, at that point, no nation of Israel.

Instead, there were broken and scarred Jewish people scattered around the world.

Places like Auschwitz-Birkenau, Dachau and Buchenwald, though they no longer existed as state-sponsored machines of death, they seemed more real, than a permanent home for the Jewish people at that time.

It was as if darkness and hopelessness had covered the Jewish people as the true extent of the Holocaust became known.

Maybe it was for such times that the Book of Joel spoke of “Young men seeing visions and old men dreaming dreams”.

And ‘the age old dream’ in the words of David Ben-Gurion was ‘the redemption of Israel’.

It was in this setting, that Australia chaired the 1947 UN Committee that voted in favour of dividing the territory of Mandate Palestine.

And on 29 November 1947, at the United Nations General Assembly, Australia joined 32 other nations in successfully voting for the Partition Plan.

Looking back across seven decades, it might seem that was a simple thing to do, an obvious choice to make.

But it was neither of those things.

But Australia made, in Doc Evatt’s words, who was instrumental in this recognition, an “inevitable and  just” choice to stand with the Jewish people of the world and their vision for a Jewish state — and a place of sanctuary where they would never again, and should never again, face persecution.

Australia extended official recognition to the new State of Israel in January 1949.

In May that same year, Australia was proud to preside over the vote which formally admitted Israel as a member of the United Nations.

As that new nation formed, the Jewish people arrived, in the words of David Ben-Gurion, with “the dew of dreams still moist in our hearts”.

Our small part, Australia’s part, is a legacy of which we are proud and one we hold dear today as we mark this anniversary.

In the words of our then Prime Minister, “The new nation of Israel will be a force of special value in the world community”, and its recognition was “fair and just”. And so it has proved to be.

Today, Israel’s light is now a beacon of democracy in the Middle East.

Ours is a 70 year long friendship between two peoples which share a commitment to democracy and the rule of law; have a multi-cultural character, committed to science and research, to a free press, to prosperity for our people and to innovation to overcome the challenges of our often hostile natural environments.

My Government is resolved to ensure our commitment to Israel remains as firm today and in the future as it indeed was 70 years ago for Australia.

That is why our Government has acted for Australia to now recognise West Jerusalem—the seat of the Knesset and many institutions of government — as the capital of the State of Israel.

And we look forward to moving our Embassy to West Jerusalem when practical, in support of, and after the final status determination of a two-state solution.

And in the spirit of a two-state solution, we acknowledge the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a future state with its Capital in East Jerusalem.  

My government is also currently establishing a Trade and Defence office in West Jerusalem to enhance and support our deepening collaboration on trade, defence industries, investment and innovation.

Just as it was 70 years ago, it remains in our national interest to see Israel continue to flourish as a liberal, participatory democracy in the Middle East.

And, now as then, Australia continues to strongly support Israel’s right to exist within secure and internationally recognised borders.

But my Government won’t just proclaim these words and these sentiments. We will continue to act on them and not step back from or shrink from our commitments. And this includes standing by Israel in the face of biased and unfair targeting of Israel in the UN General Assembly.

The UN General Assembly is now the place where Israel is bullied and where anti-Semitism is cloaked in language about human rights.

Think about it: a nation of immigrants; with a free press; parliamentary democracy; financially prosperous; the source of innovation in the world; and a refuge from persecution and genocide, is somehow now the centre of cruelty in the world, according to some in the UN.

That is intellectual fraud.

Last year, there were 17 UN General Assembly resolutions critical of Israel. This compared with a total of five covering all other countries, including Myanmar, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Russia’s actions in Crimea and Ukraine; Iran and North Korea.

This year, the UN Human Rights Council passed six motions condemning Israel, compared to a total of 14 across the rest of the world.

Last year, at my direction, Australia opposed six resolutions that attacked Israel in the UN General Assembly.  These included the ‘Jerusalem’ resolution, which contains biased and one-sided language attacking Israel and denies its historical connection to the city, and the ‘Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine’ resolution, which confers on the Palestinian Authority a status it does not have.

In the past, we had abstained on these resolutions. Not anymore, and not on my watch.

My Government will not turn a blind eye to an anti-Semitic agenda masquerading as defence of human rights in the UN.  

This has also extended to calling out those who would seek to wipe Israel from the map.

Again at my direction, last year Australia supported a UN General Assembly resolution to condemn the egregious and ongoing violent acts of the terrorist organisation Hamas.

Hamas are violent extremists. Terrorists who use the Israel-Palestinian conflict as an excuse to inflict terror.

They should have no friends at the UN.

The failure of the resolution to pass with the requisite majority was an indictment, I think, on the UN.

Australia condemns Hamas’ activities in the strongest possible terms.

Now of course, our partnership has always been underpinned by the people of our nations.

Australia’s Jewish community began with those who arrived on the First Fleet.

Though persecuted in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, Australia has been, to quote the words of the Member for Berowra, a land “almost uniquely in human history, good to the Jewish people”.

Though numbering about one hundredth of our population, Australians of Jewish heritage have made a remarkable contribution to our national life and our story.

We are the nation of John Monash, of Isaac Isaacs, Sir Zelman Cowen, Governor Linda Dessau, Frank Lowy, Harry Triguboff, and Joan Rosanove and thousands more who in their own way, have all sought to be light unto the nations, performing the mitzvot or good deeds according to the law of Moses.

Mr Speaker, Australia has been a steadfast and loyal friend to Israel since its very creation.

And I can assure the House and the people of Australia and our friends in Israel that the Liberal and Nationals Parties will never walk back or shrink from the recognition that Australia now affords Israel and the commitments and support for the state of Israel, whether in the General Assembly of the United Nations or elsewhere.

We know this about Israel, they are a steadfast and loyal friend.

Seventy years on, this Parliament re-states our commitment to Israel, to its people and to the deep friendship between our nations.

NEIL MITCHELL: Prime Minister Scott Morrison, good morning.

PRIME MINISTER: G’day Neil, good to be with you. I’m sorry we couldn’t catch up the other day.  

MITCHELL: Thank you, I understand you were ill. Thank you for your time. This cyberattack - the head of ASIO says it's an unprecedented threat, the damage will last for years. Can you rule out China as the main suspect?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I'm not commenting on where it might come from other than to say the sophistication, as I said in the Parliament yesterday, has led agencies to advise that this is a state actor but I'm not...

MITCHELL: What does that mean, what’s a state actor?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it means it’s a government. But we're not in any position to attribute that to any particular nation.

MITCHELL: So we don't know who did it.

PRIME MINISTER: We're not in a position to do that.

MITCHELL: Sorry but who do you know who did it or not?

PRIME MINISTER: No what I'm saying is you don't go and make those claims wildly.

MITCHELL: I'm not asking you to say.

PRIME MINISTER: I'm not suggesting you are. So we don't have any information, I don't have any information that would enable me to make that claim.

MITCHELL: So you don't know who did it?

PRIME MINISTER: I've said what I've said, Neil. That's a very specific wording I've used.

MITCHELL: Well clearly you've got suspicions.

PRIME MINISTER: Well it's not up to me to have suspicions and share them, it's up to me to to speak to the facts as we know them and what we can be very confident of.  

MITCHELL: Can you give us a list of likely suspects?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

MITCHELL: China says media speculation on this is heightening tensions between the two countries, is that right?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I'm not responsible for the media.

MITCHELL: No, no, but are tensions being heightened? Are tensions with China heightened?

PRIME MINISTER: We work constructively with China. I've met with [inaudible] as well as the President and we have a very important relationship with China and I'm very positive about particularly the economic growth of China. I mean, there's some suggestion that Western countries don't want to see and want to frustrate China's growth. We don't share that view. We want to see China do well. I've just been down in Melbourne recently for, you know, Chinese New Year celebrations. I think this is one of the key points - we celebrate their prosperity. And you know we've got one point two million Australians of Chinese heritage in Australia. And we celebrate those links and they’re positive.

MITCHELL: Prime Minister, I take from what you said that you've got a fair idea who's responsible and you don't want to say it, is that right?

PRIME MINISTER:  I'm not going to get into a discussion on security matters.

MITCHELL: But once it is established, will you make it public?

PRIME MINISTER: Well again, whatever we might say would be a matter that I would consult with the National Security Committee of Cabinet.  

MITCHELL: Fair enough. What… what have they got on us? Whoever did it and whoever did it, what information they got now?

PRIME MINISTER: Well yesterday Alastair MacGibbon I think sort of went into that and it's not clear what the precise purpose of this is at this stage. But those investigations continue and there is no suggestion that there is any, any at this point, any greater access to information.  But these things are concerning, as I said yesterday...

MITCHELL: If they've hacked in, there must be access to information.

PRIME MINISTER: Well I mean, people can make all sorts of suppositions. But I've just deal with the information that I have.

MITCHELL: Is there any is there any evidence or suggestion that could have been an attempt to interfere with our democratic process?

PRIME MINISTER: No, and I said that. There's no evidence to suggest that at this point.

MITCHELL: Why else would you be hacking into the Parliament?

PRIME MINISTER: Well that’s supposition, that’s speculation. And what I said in the Parliament yesterday… see, as Prime Minister I've got to stay on the facts

MITCHELL: I understand, I understand.

PRIME MINISTER: The facts say that there is there is no evidence of that. But clearly one of the general areas of risk, not specific to what I'm, you know, I've identified in the Parliament yesterday is that we need to make sure Australia is protected from this. This is why we introduced the foreign interference laws into the Parliament and...

MITCHELL: But wasn't there a warning to upgrade the system in 2015, three or four years ago?

PRIME MINISTER: Well we did and have been.

MITCHELL: The political parties as well?

PRIME MINISTER: The political parties do this under their own steam, just like any company or business does. And that's why all all businesses, all political organizations. You know, even 3AW’s website and systems. I mean, everybody is responsible for their own security on their own sites just like they are for protecting their own home. 

MITCHELL: But would I be correct in saying the area that's been hacked has a lot of personal details and on a lot of voters?

PRIME MINISTER: That's not clear. I've heard that being suggested, but there's nothing to suggest, at least in front of me, that has occurred.

MITCHELL: So it's possible, we don't really know.

PRIME MINISTER: Well anything's possible but that doesn’t mean it happened.

MITCHELL: OK. Border protection. Isn't the problem that you've been campaigning about and saying the weakening of the borders, isn't that fixed now? Nauru's tightened the laws.

PRIME MINISTER: Well what Labor did last week was weaken them.

MITCHELL: But hasn't Nauru fixed it now?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it's not quite clear what they've done and how that will play out. I think what's happened in Nauru is a good example of what happens and how Labor didn’t think through what playing around with border protection laws will do. I mean, there are consequences.

MITCHELL: The reports are in Nauru though, limited medical evacuations and stopped remote assessment by doctors. Is that right?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I'm still getting reports in of exactly what they've decided to do and what the legal force of that is.  But look that's a matter for them and it's a reminder that it's their country.

MITCHELL: But if they have done that, it certainly reinforces the strength and undermines your argument that it's weakened, doesn’t it? If they have done that?

PRIME MINISTER: What Labor did was weaken our border protection.

MITCHELL: And now Nauru has tightened it again.

PRIME MINISTER: Well what Nauru has indeed done and, that it is legally able to be done, well we’ll make our assessment on that. But there's no leave pass here for Labor. Labor weakened the border protection laws last week wilfully, wilfully.

MITCHELL: ASIO also says the leak on their advice was incorrect and you were in part using that leak publicly to convince us the boats were coming. Are the boats still coming?

PRIME MINISTER: They were always at risk of coming. That never changes.

MITCHELL:  But are the increased risks still there?

PRIME MINISTER: Of course there is. There's always that. When you weaken the border protection laws, as was said last night by Mike Pezzullo the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs, that always increases risk. Now I have taken actions on the advice of these agencies, particularly Home Affairs, to take a number of step which has included the reopening of Christmas Island, which was recommend to us by the Secretary of Home Affair. And to strengthen what we were doing with Operation Sovereign Borders and that included everything from our strategic communications through to posturing in terms of where our assets are and what they're doing and that's what we’ve done.  We had to strengthen it because Labor weakened it.

MITCHELL: Is it correct the US has refused entry to 265 people from Nauru who wanted to go there?

PRIME MINISTER: They were always not going to accept everybody, that's their own.

MITCHELL: And why have they rejected them?

PRIME MINISTER: Well for reasons that would suggest that they weren't welcome in the United States because they'd be concerned about who they were.  

MITCHELL: So what, matters of security?

PRIME MINISTER: They’re matters for the US and not for me to comment on.

MITCHELL: But I mean I'm worried that the situation. The US could say these 265 people are not coming here but do they end up in Australia?

PRIME MINISTER: Well not under our laws, but they can under Labor's.

MITCHELL: So under these changes they could still come to Australia? Rejected by the US for security reasons, you’d assume.

PRIME MINISTER: That’s exactly right and this is the point we're making. Because in a lot of these cases, these people they won't have serious criminal convictions. But they may well be facing charges for such convictions and not have been sentenced and what Labor did to the laws means there is no ability for us to stop those transfers. The other group, Neil, is the group that have been found not to be refugees.

So they're there because they refused to go home. They're not refugees, they’re living in the community in Nauru and they can also be brought to Australia where they can, you know, engage the court process and play the system like always happens.

MITCHELL: Prime Minister, I know you short for time.

PRIME MINISTER: Oh no, we’re good, we’re good.

MITCHELL: Oh good. Why should we trust Border Force? I mean, they have mucked up this footballer, Hakeem al-Araibi. He spent two months in jail in Thailand because some bloke forgot to send an e-mail. Told him it was OK to travel there. At the very least he's owed a pretty serious apology isn't he?

PRIME MINISTER: Well you know I'll be taking that up with Border Force. There had been a review into these matters internally. But it was my job to get him home and I'm very pleased that Hakeem has come home, and it was great to meet him and his wife recently in Canberra.

MITCHELL: But he wouldn't have been there of Border Force had done their job properly.

PRIME MINISTER: No I don't... I think that is actually a bit of a leap, Neil. There are many other ways that Hakeem would have been kept in (inaudible) other than just that incident. But I'm not suggesting that incident was not something that needs to be addressed. But it would be wrong to assume that other than for that that wouldn't have occurred. I don't think that’s correct.

MITCHELL: A couple of minutes prior, are you happy Mathias Cormann, your Finance Minister, took a junket, free tickets for a family holiday from a company that had just won a billion dollar contract? Is that… it doesn’t look good.

PRIME MINISTER: Well that is not what happened.

MITCHELL: But he did he take free tickets, didn’t he?

PRIME MINISTER: Well no he didn't. He thought he was paying for them.

MITCHELL: Who paid for them?

PRIME MINISTER: He has paid.

MITCHELL: He has after he got caught.

PRIME MINISTER:  Because he wasn't aware. He wasn't aware.

MITCHELL: He wasn't aware and he wasn't paying for the tickets?

PRIME MINISTER: No that's the statement that he's made and he had nothing to do with the issuing of the contract, by the way, that had been issued prior and Ministers aren’t involved in those decisions. There's a clear separation that minister… any suggestion that the two were linked would be complete rubbish.

MITCHELL: Bit it is not a good look, though.

PRIME MINISTER: Well that's why he's cleaned it up.

MITCHELL: After. I've just robbed a bank but I'll give the money back.

PRIME MINISTER: No I think that's a bit unfair to put it in those terms.

MITCHELL: It probably is.

PRIME MINISTER: There was that oversight which had been identified and he fixed it up. I mean what more can he do?

MITCHELL: He could not have taken the free tickets in the first place.

PRIME MINISTER: But he didn't take free tickets in the first place.

MITCHELL: Well they paid for his tickets.

PRIME MINISTER: He was fully… they were going to bill him and he didn’t get billed and that was drawn to his attention he paid the bill.  

MITCHELL: Well what about another case, a former Minister and a Minister Michael Keenan and Michaelia Cash refusing to cooperate with the police investigation. That's outrageous.

PRIME MINISTER: That’s not true.

MITCHELL: Did they refuse to give an interview?

PRIME MINISTER: They were written to and they were asked to respond which they did and they provided responses and the police have not sought any further statement from them. So they have cooperated.

MITCHELL: It's reported today they refused to give statements to federal police, is that right?

PRIME MINISTER: They provided a response and the police have accepted that response and they haven't sought any I'm advised, any further statement.

MITCHELL: So the police didn't want a statement, so they...

PRIME MINISTER: Well I'm just saying that cooperate with the investigation and nothing's been sought from them. And remember what this is about. This is about the alleged…

MITCHELL: A political leak.

PRIME MINISTER: Misuse of union funds by the AWU, Bill Shorten’s union. There was a raid because the police believe they were destroying evidence that may have suggested that the Shorten’s union was sending money, allegedly, to GetUp! and even to his own benefit. So that's what this is about. So Bill Shorten should cooperate and actually provide the minutes of meetings and the other things that are necessary for the police to do their investigation. I think he's the one with the questions to answer and obviously to be cooperating.

MITCHELL: Well I thought everybody should cooperate. You would hope, that didn’t happen here in Victoria.

PRIME MINISTER: They should, you’re dead right Neil. People should cooperate with police investigations and my Ministers have.

MITCHELL: OK speaking just quickly of Victoria, a three billion dollar cheque you us for a road down here. Are we going to get it?

PRIME MINISTER: I will continue to work with the Victorian government. Let's just be very clear. What there is, is a contingent liability in in the Budget. What does that mean? That means if the state government had chosen to trigger investment in the East West Link, then the Commonwealth would have raised that money to support that project. So it's not like there's three billion dollars sitting actually there to spend on the road. That money would have to be added to the bottom line of the Budget and that would have to be allocated, so it would have to be new money. But I can tell you, we've already put in the last Budget there was over seven billion dollars we invested in Victorian infrastructure, we’re investing in busting infrastructure all over Melbourne and I'm keen to do more and I'm keen to work with the Victorian Government to achieve that. And we've got a Budget coming up in April and we'll have a bit more to say that then.

MITCHELL: Prime Minister, you've come back in the polls. Is that the message you're getting from the ground, you’re back in the fight?

PRIME MINISTER: Look all I've been doing Neil is [inaudible], showing Australians what our record is on national security, on the economy and that's what guarantees essential services. People I'm finding when I when I'm relating this to them, are responding well. I think they're focusing very much on the future and what it all means for them. I think, you know, the Canberra Bubble and all the noise here which people go on to, they're telling me very clearly that they're not interested in, there interested in what's going ahead in the future to the extent that is being well received, I welcome it.  

MITCHELL: I assume you're confident about being re-elected.

PRIME MINISTER: Of course. I mean, I didn't take the job on to, you know, to do anything else but that. I took the job one because I believed it was essential that the Liberal and National parties will return to this next election because the Labor Party will change it all. The retirees tax, the housing taxes, busting the borders - all of this, Labor will change it all.

MITCHELL: If you are re-elected, given the history of the party in recent years, can you guarantee to stay Prime Minister for three years?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

MITCHELL: How?

PRIME MINISTER: Because our party resolved that last year. An elected Liberal Prime Minister will now have the security of that arrangement over the next term. That's what we saw last year.  

MITCHELL: Well if you’re not re-elected do you want to be opposition leader?

PRIME MINISTER: I'm not contemplating that situation. I'm contemplating being re-elected and ensuring that we continue to keep Australia safe, secure borders, and keep our economy strong.  

MITCHELL: Well they’re both hypothetical

PRIME MINISTER: Not in my mind. I’m dealing with the reality. You know me, Neil. I’ll leave nothing on the field.

MITCHELL: So what emoji are you going to put on your number plate?

PRIME MINISTER: Oh a big smiley face, mate. A big smiley face. You know me, I’m that cheery. How about you? I'd love to know what yours is.

MITCHELL: Might be grumpy.

[Laughter]

Thank you for your time.

PRIME MINISTER: Good on you Neil, cheers mate.


STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

Photo: AAP Image/Mick Tsikas

PRIME MINISTER: Mr Speaker, I move that the resolution of the Senate be agreed to.

Mr Speaker, I take the issue of abuse and the neglect of people with a disability very seriously and so does the Government I lead as well. We take it seriously, because abuse and the neglect of our most vulnerable is abhorrent. As we have seen in other areas, institutions who we expect to provide care and support have often failed in providing that care. In the past, all too often we thought abuse or neglect in institutions were isolated occurrences. Instead, we discovered it was systemic failure, as we noted last year in relation to the National Apology.

So we must be vigilant in ensuring the standards of care for people with disabilities are at their absolute highest. That is why our Government is undertaking substantial reform to improve the treatment of people with disability.

We have established a royal commission into abuse and neglect in the aged care sector, including the abuse of young people with disabilities in aged care facilities. We were able to establish this quickly, as the Commonwealth has responsibility for the funding and legislation of aged care. As well, there have been a number of inquiries looking into issues of abuse and neglect of people with a disability, at both a federal and state level. These inquiries have identified many issues relevant to the disability sector and have been incorporated into the NDIS quality and safeguarding framework.

As Members know, the focus of the Government has been on rolling out the National Disability Insurance Scheme, as well as ensuring a new national quality and safeguard system to support people with a disability. As part of that the Government has established new, significant and comprehensive safeguards to prevent abuse and neglected people with a disability under the NDIS.

The Commonwealth provided $209 million to establish the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission , the NDIS Commission, to regulate the delivery of services under the NDIS and protect the rights of people with a disability. The NDIS Commission has a number of critical functions, including registering providers, handling complaints and reportable incidents, enforcing a code of conduct for NDIS providers and worker and national policy setting for consistent worker screening. It also has strong investigation and regulatory powers and can take tough, appropriate action including deregistration, banning orders and civil penalties. The NDIS Commission has extensive powers over both registered and unregistered providers. The NDIS and the associated quality and safeguarding arrangements are still in the process of being rolled out across Australia. The NDIS Commission commenced operations in New South Wales and South Australia on 1 July 2018 and will commence in the ACT, the Northern Territory, Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria on 1 July 2019 and in Western Australia, on 1 July 2020. This means that the Commonwealth currently has very limited jurisdiction in regulation of disability services.

Mr Speaker, on Friday I received correspondence from Senator Steele-John which contained a draft terms of reference for the proposed royal commission into disability services. I thank him for doing so and I appreciate the very concrete and very detailed suggestions that he has been able to provide to us on this issue. They of course will be of assistance as we consider now, this motion and move forward on this matter. I note his terms of reference seeks to look into the experiences - rightly I should stress - of people directly or indirectly affected in institutional, residential or other contexts.

As the Attorney-General noted on the weekend, a royal commission looking into past issues, backwards, into issues around disability care is essentially then a royal commission that would look into state facilities. That at the very least would require consultation and agreement with the states and likely letters patent from the states. We understand this to be true. This should not be a royal commission that only looks at a narrow area of responsibility that has only become part of the Commonwealth's responsibility in recent times. The issues that are relevant here go back over some period of time, certainly back a decade and they principally involve the conduct of state and territory governments in the delivery of disability services. They should, obviously, be considered in any royal commission that was held into this area.

I do note, as I did in Question Time today though, that the establishment of a royal commission was previously discussed through the Council of Australian Government and the COAG Disability Reform Council and at that time, states and territories did not indicate support for a royal commission. So these are hurdles that would have to be addressed.

I want to keep all Australians safe, Mr Speaker and to use whatever powers we have to do so. But this work often requires us to work in partnership with the states and territories and that's what we'll have to address ourselves to, going forward.

Violence, abuse and neglect of people with disability outside service settings such as at home or in the community is mostly covered under state and territory law. So working with the states and territories in this area, both looking at matters in the past as well as looking forward, will be absolutely essential. So I will be seeking further advice from all states and territories to discuss this important matter of establishing a royal commission, as well as consulting directly and extensively with stakeholders about what the precise terms of reference might be and what other royal commissions, in particular the Aged Care Royal Commission, might be able to offer as a way to address these issues.

Now these are the options before the Government. As the House knows, calling a royal commission is a matter for the Executive Government. The House - as has the Senate - has put forward a motion and it won’t be opposed by the Government. It will be supported by the Government. But it will be the Government that then will take that matter into consideration and work through all the necessary issues to be able to do something positively in this area and to act on these issues. That's exactly what we'll do.

We have no interest, Mr Speaker, in making any partisanship of this issue. One of the reasons I decided to establish the Royal Commission into Aged Care, is I believe the Royal Commission into Aged Care would provide a fact base, a new platform to support a further decade of bipartisan in action on aged care, because I was concerned that that bipartisanship was waning. I sincerely hope that that is not the case in relation to the disability care and to be able to go forward with this issue, that is the good faith in which I will engage the issue and seek to lead the issue forward. So, I will report back to the House when I have further advice and able to make announcements as and when the Government is in a position to do so. With that, I move that the resolution of the Senate be agreed to.


ALAN JONES: Thank you for your time. Could I just begin by saying that politicians rarely get praise. I have been speaking to farmers during the course of the weekend. You went to Julia Creek. They asked me if I'd thank you for going there. They believe you should know that you were fair dinkum and compassionate, and they wanted to say thank you because that opportunity isn't available to them. Can I just ask you, having been there and witnessed this devastation to listen, you're talking to people all over Australia. What was your reaction?

PRIME MINISTER: It was heartbreaking. It was devastating, not just there but also over Cloncurry. In both places and talking to a lot of the graziers, the property owners and other small business owners, the trucking companies. This is devastating, personally to families but also obviously the local economy. Obviously we're going to have to play a very big role in rebuilding the cattle industry in North Queensland. I can't imagine Australia without a cattle industry in North Queensland, it's not the same place. That’s basically what I said, it's a way of life, but it's also intrinsic to the success.

JONES: It's the fourth biggest export market.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah it is just … so we're there, that's the commitment I made. The reconstruction effort, it’s going to be significant and it's going to take a long time. It's not, you know, an announcement today or next week, it's the next two, five, ten years.

JONES: Can I come to that in a moment, just on basically what you saw. I mean, how long did they tell you… I know the military have got about 150 personnel on the ground. My own view from talking to people is that - I don't know how many people you can have on the ground - it wouldn't be enough. I mean how long did they tell you it would take to clean up? This is all they will be talking about at this hour of the morning; bloated animals which are littering the landscape. I mean there are kangaroos as well as cattle, 30,000 sheep. The infrastructure has been wrecked. The Flinders Highway east of Julia Creek is still cut as I said last night. There were travelers and trucks stranded. The railway track from Mount Isa to Townsville was completely buckled. How does Mount Isa get its copper, lead and zinc for export to Townsville? These are massive logistical problems.

PRIME MINISTER: They all are. Look, the way I'm looking at it, there's three stages to this. The first stage is the immediate response and that's everything from mental health support to immediate cash assistance too. Just the physical, immediate response. That's been underway now as you know, with Brigadier Jobson and the $1 million we've put into each of the councils, the $75,000 that’s going to reach the producers. That’s just to deal with the most immediate reaction to what is happening there.

The second stage is really doing what you've just mentioned. It's the rail line, it's the road, it's the disposal plan that is now being enacted up there to remove the carcasses, to have them buried safely. Now, what the station owners, what the producers told me is they very much want to control that process.

JONES: Yes, they don't want the councils. They're worried about the council, it’s separate from the graziers.

PRIME MINISTER: They're supporting them in it but they just don't want, you know, people just stomping all over their properties. They know how to do this, they're getting the support through both the safety equipment and the protective gear, which you need because I tell you, you smell this stuff long before you see it and it has to be done.

JONES: And it stays with you.

PRIME MINISTER: The Queensland Government is working with us on that. The military are directly involved. But also I've got to say the mining industry up there, Glencore in particular, have been fantastic with their help. Because their equipment that they have there, their heavy equipment is suited for those conditions. So they are marshalling all of the heavy equipment they have up in that region to support that role of disposal and they're focusing on things like clearing the Flinders and Landsborough Highways. That's as important for morale as it is for safety and getting these carcass out of the way. But Alan, they still don't know the extent of the losses. I mean, I was on one station and they hadn't been able to venture too far out from the homestead because of where the waters had been and so they were guessing. They were -

JONES: There’s still an area the size of England underwater. There’s still an area the size of England underwater.

PRIME MINISTER: There’s an inland sea. I saw it was making its way down through the Gulf. So you know, this is a long way from over in terms of the immediate impact. But the third phase of course is there is the reconstruction and what I was incredibly impressed by, was the will to rebuild. A mate of yours, you know Phillip, I spoke to Phillip at the Gannons Hotel in Julia Creek. I thought he put it best; “We don't want people -

JONES: Just stop there for a minute, just stop there for one minute. There’s a lot of people out there that know this bloke, Scott Morrison. He's brand new on the block. New Prime Minister, people don't know about him now. I - and I can tell them this - I texted the Prime Minister on Friday to just say; “Look, there's a farmer up there who really would like to say something to you. If you get the chance at Julia Creek, could you see him?” And I sent the mobile number. The Prime Minister rang the farmer, which to the farmer was virtually like, you know, God arriving, that someone of his status would ring. Rang the farmer, had a beer with him, stuck a cap on. Scott Morrison, you have no idea what that meant to those people there.

PRIME MINISTER: Well they were very encouraged and it's great to be able to do that as a Prime Minister. Because what they really want is the plan to go forward.

JONES: They do.

PRIME MINISTER: They want to rebuild and they know it's not going to be easy. And it's different station by station, Alan. I mean, you can't just drop a whole bunch of cash from the sky on this thing. That's not going to work. What they need is a reconstruction plan, property by property by property, because they're all different. I mean, one of the stations I went to that is basically the top of the breeding cycle for Australia's herd. They have been genetically, you know, supporting their herd up there for generations now. You can't just go and buy cattle from the Northern Territory to replace those. They took generations to breed in and that's going to take a lot of time. So the value of those cattle is extremely high. You've got others which is at the other end. So every case is different. Their debt is structured differently. Their capacity to borrow is different. Some have lost 30 some have lost 95 per cent.

JONES: You said you'd cut red tape so that small business operators – this is at the bottom end of the market - could get $25,000 disaster relief payments. Philip Alexander, the supermarket owner, told you that no one fitted into the category and he said I can't handle this paperwork. You said leave the paperwork to me. What does that mean?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it means I'm working on that now. One of the things I brought back - I'm going to be working Michaelia Cash and the Queensland Government over the course of this week - my first priority was to sort out the paperwork on the $75,000 for the producers, for the graziers. We got that sorted before I even got up there on Thursday night and that was well received, I can tell you, at the Cloncurry Bowling Club. I'm pretty happy about that. So now we need to apply ourselves to sorting out how that's going to work for the small business owners. I've got to say, in Cloncurry it was a bit better than Julia Creek. In Julia Creek, they really were hit very hard there. Because I mean, over at Cloncurry, you've also got the Henry mine so you've got you know the mining sector there as well. It's a bit more divers. But for some of these other smaller towns it's all about the cattle industry.

JONES: Can I just raise this with you - and I wrote to you about this - but you have said quite a few times since Friday, you've talked about a 10 year rescue plan. PM, many of these people won't be here in 10 years. I was asking you on behalf of the farmers, whether the Cabinet would consider giving a 100 per cent compensation for losses, so that the farmers and the businesses can immediately continue to employ - because those employed continue to pay taxes and they won’t go onto welfare which will cost the taxpayer a fortune - can build the infrastructure, the roads and railways lines, the fences and the sheds and can buy materials and work from the locals which will rebuild the community and the families together.

I hate to inject a negative point in here, but they keep saying to me that there wasn't a 10 year plan to give $444 million dollars to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.

PRIME MINISTER: Well they’re completely different things. I mean the Great Barrier Reef Foundation that's money to actually apply over that period of time Alan and it's being done through one organization, so that wasn’t just today, that was for many, many years to come. So I think with respect, the two things are quite different.

JONES: Okay well what do you say –

PRIME MINISTER: What we’re talking about here, up in north Queensland

JONES: They’ve got no money, no income.

PRIME MINISTER: I understand that and this will cost hundreds of millions of dollars if not more.

JONES: It will, it will.

PRIME MINISTER: It's going to require a reconstruction plan, property by property. It's going to require dealing with existing debt. It's going to have to deal with future debt. It's going to have to deal with subsidies for how you rebuild your stock. So this is what we're putting in place.

JONES: But you see, the date today Scott, the date today Prime Minister, is the 18th February 18. Come March 1 the mortgage payments due.

PRIME MINISTER: No but they won't be Alan. That's the thing, the banks are already –

JONES: But for the workers, it’s due for the worker as well, it's due for the small businessman in Townsville.

PRIME MINISTER: Exactly and that's why we'll work on those 25,000 payments and their extension. That's why we've put the 1 million bucks into every single council.

JONES: Where does the money come from, to go out and buy the fence posts, to be able to start fencing hundreds of miles that have been destroyed?

PRIME MINISTER: Well that's what we'll do, property by property by property. One thing I'm not going to do is rush to failure on this. I am acutely aware of the urgency. I've spoken to people directly about it on the ground and as Phil said to me in the pub of the Gannons Hotel he said; “What we want is reconstruction not compensation”. So they want us to partner with them to rebuild every single one of these stations. It’s my plan for them all to be there in 10 years and I'm going to do that working with every individual station.

JONES: Okay just a couple of things before you go. Kerryn Phelps has been in Parliament for five minutes, we now face 2008 revisited, when Labor abolished the Pacific solution.

PRIME MINISTER: And temporary protection visas.

JONES: And temporary protection visas. That cost us 16 billion dollars. Now, where do you think we stand, in a realistic sense in relation to this, what is your intelligence telling you now - Home Affairs, security, ASIO, all these people and your contacts in Indonesia - about boat people?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, it says we need to firm up Operation Sovereign Borders, which is exactly what I did the day after, and on the day of the vote I convened the National Security Committee. We put those measures in place. We've engaged in direct messaging into the region that, you know, that may have happened, but frankly I'm still here, Peter Dutton is still here, the Government is still here, the one that stopped the boats and we won't let you in.

I mean I didn't want to have to reopen the Christmas Island detention centre a week ago, I didn't have to. I do today and that's going to cost about half a billion dollars.

JONES: That was recommended to you by Home Affairs.

PRIME MINISTER: By Home Affairs, exactly. So you've got the Labor Party out there saying; “Oh, we will always follow the advice of agencies on this”. Yet they're describing the decision to reopen Christmas Island as ridiculous.

JONES: What is the problem with Nauru? I don't understand what the problem with Manus is, I mean there’s 64 professionals there, half of them are doctors.

PRIME MINISTER: If you had anywhere in Australia the ratio of medical professionals to people –

JONES: One to seven?

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah one to seven and 14 – 1 for mental health services. I mean, there's nowhere in the country to my knowledge that that's it's that concentrated, not even in Wentworth for goodness sake with the number of doctors they have there.

JONES: You should open a detention centre there. What's the point of going to the polls, if in fact migration policy and refugee policy is going to be determined by doctors?

PRIME MINISTER: That's what Labor have done. That's exactly what they have done, taking it away. But you're right the medical professionals are there. The children are off. So what this is about - let's make no mistake - is about shutting down offshore processing. That's what it's about. That's what Labor voted for. They did it with their eyes wide open. They had the declassified advice and the classified briefings from ASIO and from the head of the Defence Force and the head of Home Affairs and Sovereign Borders. And when we'd gone and implemented that advice, they said; “Oh what did you have to do that for?” Well, we told you what was going to have to happen if you voted for that bill. He has decided to take a cheap vote in Canberra to play to the Canberra bubble, rather than understand that Australians expect political leaders to stand up for border protection, which is what I’ve always done.

JONES: I will just confirm, you already have, sorry - it was last week, before this rubbish was passed – a Transitory Persons Committee don't you? I think within the Department of Home Affairs and they meet once a month?

PRIME MINISTER: Medical professionals.

JONES: That’s right, they assess the needs and seek urgent medical care, the mechanism is in place and there have been transfers from the Papua New Guinea or Nauru since July 2016.

PRIME MINISTER: There have.

JONES: That's already being done. So basically, this is a heap of humbug.

PRIME MINISTER:  They sought to solve a problem that didn't exist.

JONES: Yep.

PRIME MINISTER: And as a result - you know, what I should be focusing on, only frankly, at the moment is dealing with these issues in north Queensland not having to reopen a detention centre on Christmas Island because Bill Shorten the Labor Party wanted to go and crash border protection in this country.

JONES: And implement a policy –

PRIME MINISTER: The money I’m going to spend on Christmas Island, I would very much like to be spending all of that up in north Queensland. That's where the rubber hits the road.

JONES: Well if the Labor Party - and this very political, I know he’s pretending it’s not –

PRIME MINISTER: Just on North Queensland, let me be clear, I'm still going to make sure that’s happening. But you can imagine my fury and frustration.

JONES: And I think the public feel that way as well and it is political. He’s saying; “Oh, get the politics out of it.” It is political. But if the Labor Party in Opposition will reject the advice from the Department, from ASIO and from security and intelligence people, what chance do any of us have when they are in government?

PRIME MINISTER: Well that's right and they say they'll still turn boats back. Well, really? really? Tanya Plibersek sitting in the National Security Committee with Bill Shorten? “Trust us, we’ll still turn boats back”. They’ve got no idea what's involved.

JONES: Good on you.

PRIME MINISTER: I know, I did it.

JONES: Yes, I know. Well listen we thank you for that, we'll talk again and we'll keep you posted on the feedback from the farmers as well.

PRIME MINISTER: Can I just say one last thing Alan.

JONES: Yes?

PRIME MINISTER: Sisters of the North; they have done an amazing job in raising funds for people up there and there's a bloke up there, Tim Pratt who runs a trucking company.

JONES: Yes, the cap.

PRIME MINISTER: He was the one, I wore a cap of his and people sledged me for the hat.

JONES: The cap on, good on you. Good on you. 

PRIME MINISTER: But he's got a thing called Gumnut Designz and they're selling hats to raise money for Sisters of the North which is supporting those local charities up there. In about 24 hours they'd raised 120 grand, when I got there on Thursday night. It's awesome.

JONES: Leave it with me.

PRIME MINISTER: I'll send you the details.DOORSTOP, JULIA CREEK, QLD

BELINDA MURPHY, MCKINLAY SHIRE COUNCIL MAYOR: So firstly welcome, everyone, especially the Prime Minister, to McKinlay Shire and to the Shires of the North West. The support we’ve received from the Prime Minister down over the last ten days, and the State Government, has been phenomenal and we cannot express how much we’re happy to have you out here. As confronting as it is to see on the ground what is going on, we’re really looking forward to the discussions moving forward. We’re very happy with where they’re going at the moment. The Prime Minister has taken time out already to talk to our local businesses. This is beyond the farm gate. This is about the survival of our communities in the North West and I think that’s clearly understood from the top down. We look forward to him meeting with our graziers and continuing today. So, welcome, and also, Deb, thank you very much for coming.

DEB FRECKLINGTON, QUEENSLAND LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: No worries, Belinda.

PRIME MINISTER: Belinda, thank you very much. John and the other mayors who have been with me here as I came into Cloncurry last night. Those who I spoke to at the Bowl-o last night and then producers this morning, small businesses, Lions Club. Once again, in a scene of a genuine national disaster, we are seeing the real mettle of Australians, we’re seeing the real resolve, the real heart and compassion of Australians, thinking of others first before themselves. This is my number one priority right here, right now. It has been pressing now as the events unfolded here in the space of such a short period of time and I think I’d ask all Australians to be mindful of the level of shock that are in these communities. I know there are people all around the country who are wanting to help and they’re actually even asking, “Why haven’t they got back to us? We’re offering help.” Well, the reason they haven’t is because they’re dealing with a lot here. And there’s a lot going on here now as these communities are getting around each other and they’re working on the immediate response to the disaster that has occurred here.

The disaster that has occurred here is different in all different parts of the regions. It’s affecting small businesses in some towns different to other towns. The producers, the graziers themselves, the nature of their herds and the stock losses is different. The composition is different and right now, the urgent need is to deal with the immediate response, which is why we have provided the Category D assistance to primary producers at $25,000 up to $75,000. We’ve ditched all the paperwork. We’ve provided Category C assistance to those who are eligible for small businesses and we’re looking at the eligibility of that.

We’ve provided them $1 million for each Shire that is affected and we’re looking at extending that, even now as we speak, to those who are affected. Where it’s needed it’s going to happen but the nature of our response is very much being guided by the local mayors here right across North Western Queensland and I want to commend them for their leadership. They have been under an enormous amount of pressure as they have been dealing, in many cases, with the impacts to them and their own families, let alone what’s happening more broadly in their communities, and the leadership they have shown to gather people together, the volunteer effort, to make sure that I, the Premier and others are informed about what the needs are has been excellent. I also want to thank Brigadier Jobson for the amazing work that he’s been doing. And he, like me though, we’re taking our instructions from the local mayors here because they’re the ones who are in constant contact with their community and their graziers and primary producers.

There is a long road ahead here. Of course we need to provide the immediate response and that is occurring as we speak. We then must look to the future and the future requires some key things to be done. First of all, if you look around here, you know, you’ve got to rebuild a lot of this critical infrastructure which is linking all of these towns and linking up their economies. This is very important, we’ll be doing that together with the State Government and the Deputy Prime Minister and with Linda Reynolds – the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs – they’ll be here over the next few days working through some of those issues. But it’s also about restocking, it’s also about the future – the next five and ten years. This will be again one of the most prosperous regions in the country. It is the top of the supply chain in many respects when it comes to our cattle industry and we’re going to rebuild the cattle industry here. That’s my message to the people of North Queensland.

My Government, working together with everyone else, we’re going to rebuild the cattle industry and it’s going to be an area of great opportunity and prosperity into the future but we need to get back to that starting line. We’ve been knocked off our feet here a bit right across the region but we will get back up, we will all get back up together and we’ll get back to that starting line and we will do everything that is necessary to help people do that. There’s issues of debt to deal with. There’s issue of the stock losses. There’s issues of cash flow. We’re aware of all of these things but the other thing we must be keenly aware of is we have to get these plans right. That’s why I’m here. Of course I'm here to provide some comfort and to let people know that the rest of the country that they are here with them as well. But I’m also here to listen about what the recovery and reconstruction plan is and we’re quite advanced in our thinking in these areas and what I’ve been able to do over the last 24 hours, as well as the earlier contact I’ve had with the mayors and the military and others, is to really start fashioning some serious longer term plans.

I’ll have more to say about that when we’ve got it right. But in these situations and in the wake of a natural disaster like this, you don’t rush to failure, you get it right, you listen, you get the facts in, you listen to what all the options are and then you take action on the basis of the decisions you make. That’s what I’ll be doing and, so, I would ask for some immediate patience because I believe, as Belinda and I were discussing – and John and Greg this morning, that’s what they want too. They’ve got to make a lot of decisions locally too. You don’t want to make decisions in the immediate wake of a disaster that you regret in two, three years’ time or even 12 weeks’ time. So, we will get those decisions right, we’ll get them right by working closely together.

But for today, my heart goes out to the people of North Queensland. You know, it’s very upsetting. I mean, you can’t smell what we can smell here today and I’ve got to tell you, it doesn’t smell as bad here as it did where I was earlier today, as I was with families who have been on this land for generations, building up a herd of the finest cattle in the world that are Australian, generations of breeding, and to see that all washed away and lying just in the mud which is turning to dry dirt and the smell is overwhelming. So there’s a lot of healing that has to go on here. We’ve put the additional mental health support into the programs here and I was pleased last night at the Bowl-o to be hearing back from people about how they welcome that. A simple request is that Australians will reach out to you and you will reach out to each other and on the other side, as always, we will be stronger than ever.

JOURNALIST: Do you think the wider Australia understands the scale of this disaster? People that don’t live in this region, they’ve seen pictures but do you think they get a sense of just how big it is?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I don’t and I don’t say that critically. I mean, how can you? You know, I’m a boy from the Sydney suburbs, I’ve been here before actually, it was 30 years ago. I’ve been to Cloncurry more recently so I do know this part of the world maybe a little bit better but they can’t. And what they can’t understand I suppose is that, it’s not just the economic impact of this and the natural impact of this. This is a livelihood, it’s a life, it’s a way of life and we’ve got to make sure that doesn’t get washed out to sea as well and it won’t because none of the people I've spoken to today who can still put a smile on their face and tell you a good yarn, they’re going to stay and they want to stay but they’re saying, “Can you help us stay?” And my answer to them is, “Yes, I will.”

JOURNALIST: In terms of the losses, it is a significant chunk of the beef industry. Do you anticipate that will have a national effect?

PRIME MINISTER: Of course it will. Just like the droughts have. The drought has had a significant impact and I’ve got to say, in preparing our reconstruction plans, a lot of the lessons that we’ve worked on and learnt through what Major General Stephen Day’s been doing as the Drought Coordinator, we can apply here. I mean, frankly, some of the water infrastructure, on-farm infrastructure, write-off programs and things like that will actually come in very handy here. I mean, you can’t just go and put a whole bunch of new stock on these properties tomorrow morning. Fences have to be fixed, turkey’s nest, all this sort of stuff. This all has to be fixed. There’s a lot of work that has to go on to these farms now and so that’s a key part of the plan. And then there’s the restocking. But as I’ve said, the property I was out at today, they just can’t go and just buy the same stock they had before. They built those stocks up over generations and they have to breed that stock back up and that will take many years.

Now, they’ll have other options in the meantime to run a sort of a cash operation to do that but to rebuild that, that won’t happen overnight. But there are others who have different operations and there will be an opportunity. There’s opportunities for adjustment, there’ll be opportunities where there are more drought-affected areas and where some of that stock might be able to come here. So we’ll see. But they’re the plans and the details we’ll have to work on. I also want to thank those who have been carting fodder up here, the fodder drops that have been done over the last week or so. And are now extending more into the Gulfow country where it’s going, that will continue but now we’re getting to the point where we’re over that immediate demand and I’ve got to say to the ADF, who were rescuing people in the middle of those floods, Lindsay and Sally I know out at Longford had to be rescued off the top of their roof and the only offence they took was that they were described as an older couple – with a smile on their face so that shows you the sense of humour that’s still here.

JOURNALIST: PM, you said you don’t want to rush it but any idea of a timeframe on when we might have…?

PRIME MINISTER: I’m not talking months, I’m not necessarily talking days but I’m not talking weeks either. This is an important part of my process and it’s important why Linda and Michael will be here tomorrow and working closely, I’ve got to say, with the State Government and retired Major General Smith. Retired Major General Smith who is the State Coordinator working together with Brigadier Jobson, they are dealing predominately with this immediate response and recovery. What I’m talking about is a five, ten year plan to rebuild the cattle industry.

JOURNALIST: What else outside of the cattle industry, how to rebuild these towns, aside from the industry stuff?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, you’ve got to keep the money churning in the economy. That’s what we’ve learnt from the drought. One of the things that has been most successful in our drought program was those $1 million we put into all of these councils, you know, a very large investment, $100 million and more and what that means is that the money, whether it’s been doing up the local amenities block or doing some dog-fencing or things like that, that’s kept money moving around the town. As we were just chatting before, Belinda, with the local small-business people, they’ve got cash flow problems at the moment because the people that need to pay them, they’ve been underwater. And so there’s going to be a bit of a cash crunch here, a bit of a cash drought in the next little while. So our small business programs, and I’ll be speaking to Minister Cash about that, the need to be integrate in with what we’re doing with the primary producers as well. That’s why it’s not a simple answer and I know when there are natural disasters, everybody thinks, “You’ve just got to do this and this and you send them the army and it’s all done.” No, no. This is far more complex. It goes to your question. This issue is far more devastating and far more widespread and it requires a much broader and comprehensive response.

JOURNALIST: The Queensland Government has a new report out into the Adani project which looks like it could be killed off because of the small black finch…?

PRIME MINISTER: I’m happy to take that question in a sec, I’m very happy to take that question but if there are other questions on…?

JOURNALIST: Do we have any idea of the scale of the losses at this stage?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I think that’s the short answer. I mean, I’ve been talking to producers today, they don’t know. The best estimates I’m getting from them is saying 50 per cent, the worst is 100 per cent. Estimates of 80 per cent. So, it’s the worst this district has seen. I mean, in the 70s, there was very severe conditions of drought – for floods then, they’ve had droughts here too but what really snapped this more than anything was the combination of the floods and then the winds. I was at a property this morning, the flooding impact was not actually that significant relatively speaking. What killed their herd was the wind and the exposure. So it was the combination of these two events together which really proved just deadly.

JOURNALIST: On Adani, are you concerned that this ABC report on the black finch could be the death nail for the mine? What’s it going to mean?

PRIME MINISTER: Look, I’m always concerned about jobs and I’m always concerned with people playing games about jobs. We support the mining industry. We want to see mining jobs and we want to be able to see projects stand on their two feet and be given a go on the basis of their commercial realities. We don’t think they should get special legs-up or subsidies or anything like this. But I think the people of Queensland are dealing with enough at the moment without having decisions to take away their jobs.

JOURNALIST: Just one more, will the Government accept Brian Burston’s vote in the Senate going forward?

PRIME MINISTER: How he votes is up to him. We’re not negotiating any votes with him. That’s not how it works. We’re not seeking his vote on things. What he does is up to him. What they all do. You know, you could say the same thing about the Greens. I mean, they all wreak their havoc in one way, shape or form from time to time but last night I was pleased to see that we were able to get some very important legislation passed in relation to superannuation.

JOURNALIST: Do you have a view on the suspension of the parliamentary pass of James Ashby?

PRIME MINISTER: No because I’m not the Speaker and I’m not the President of the Senate. I’m happy to leave those matters to those guys.

JOURNALIST: The Government’s been warning about rapists and paedophiles and murderers being among those brought into Australia under the Medivac regime. Isn’t there a risk that this sort of extreme rhetoric could imperil the US deal to take 1,200 refugees?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I actually met with our Ambassador yesterday and the US deal is fine. I mean, we’re just telling the truth about what’s going on with all that. I’ll tell you one thing, you know, I’ve got to tell you, we’re here trying to put a reconstruction plan together for North Queensland. The fact that I have to go and spend half a billion dollars in the next two years and $1.4 billion over the next four years to reopen a detention centre that I don’t need to open, four days ago, the fact that I have to do it now because the Parliament decided to make a stupid decision, makes me pretty angry because I want to invest that money here, not on a detention centre that I now have to open because of people who made a very bad decision. Thanks very much.


Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison attends the International Women's Day breakfast at Parliament House in Canberra, Thursday, February 14, 2019.
REMARKS, INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY PARLIAMENTARY BREAKFAST

PRIME MINISTER: Good morning, how good is Aunty Violet, how good was that? Thank you so much for your welcome to country. Can I also acknowledge that Ngunnawal people and elders past and present and indeed emerging, and pay my respects to Indigenous peoples all around Australia. It’s a very important day today for Indigenous Australians, for all Australians in fact, as we gather in the Parliament and we deliver the Closing the Gap report. And I can tell you in terms of a future Aboriginal Prime Minister Jacinta price is running in the seat of Lingiari and she's fantastic. So we wish her all the best.

Well good morning and thank you for being here today. Can I acknowledge the many parliamentary colleagues who are here with us today. Of course Kelly and Bill and Penny and Richard who are here. Can I particularly though, and I'm sure they won't mind, that we have so many people I'm not going to acknowledge each individually but I want to pay tribute to Julie Bishop for the wonderful work she's done all around the world for women.

[Applause]

Starting early gives us some time to reflect on the extraordinary achievements of women all around Australia and all around the world. Because the story of Australia is a story of strong women. Women who have had the courage of their convictions who have lived out their beliefs. They haven't all been famous. But they have all been brave. They've all been courageous. They have all showed a determination, a compassion, and a love that has extended beyond generations.

My late great great Aunt was Dame Mary Gilmore as the Member for Kennedy, as Bob said to the House the other day. And she has been growing up in our family, she was the great icon of our family. She wouldn't have shared the same political views of me today, I suspect. But that said, she was a great Australian woman who championed so many important causes and blazed a trail in this country that left her on the ten dollar note. But on this day of all days, Dame Mary was a woman who understood the disposition of Indigenous peoples probably better than anyone of her time and was speaking out about it at the time when it was neither fashionable nor popular and she blazed a great trail. And I'll be very pleased to stand in this Parliament today and speak of these issues knowing that Dame Mary had gone before me. She was courageous and determined.

It is those qualities that we can draw on to work to ensure equal opportunity and more choice for women in this country, something that I know Kelly O'Dwyer has been a real leader on I want to congratulate you Kelly for the work you've done in this portfolio.

[Applause]

Last year Kelly addressed the National Press Club and she had something to say that I think is timeless. She said, “Gender equality isn't about pitting girls against boys. Or women against men. It's about recognising that girls and women deserve an equal stake in our economy and our society. It's not about conflict.” It's about what the message of the day is about. Which is about doing this together. She said, “Life is not a zero sum game, we’re on a life journey together.” And she's right about that. Kelly said she was speaking as the mother of a son and a daughter. I suspect on occasion, those boys and girls are against each other occasionally but I'm sure Mom and Dad sort it out.

I'm the blessed father of two beautiful young girls and they are of course the joy of my and Jenny's life. And my girls, like all of our children, they allow us as parents to see the world through new eyes, through young eyes, through fresh eyes. And when I see the girls I want them to be able to pursue their passions. I want them to be absolutely confident that they can chase their dreams whatever they are. And receive the same rewards for their hard work and their beliefs and their passions as their male counterparts and indeed I've had the blessing to do over my life. I want them as adults to have real choices so they can decide what works best for them and their families and not be judged for it. I want them to be free from harassment and violence. I want them to be able to walk the streets of Australia. And I want them to be safe in their home, both today and always in the future.

Now our priorities. As the Prime Minister I've laid out three priorities from the very first day. Keeping our economy strong, keeping Australians safe and keeping Australians together. It is very much the theme of today. Economic opportunities, the choices and security that can come with it at the heart of what my Government is seeking to do for a more prosperous, safe and cohesive Australia.

Last year's landmark release of the Women's Economic Security Statement by Kelly delivered for women by helping boost their skills and employability, backing them to start their own businesses importantly, and giving women more options to secure their financial independence when they need it most particularly in their retirement. And that is the agenda we're working to with increased flexibility for paid parental leave and supporting entrepreneurship opportunities for women and the STEM programs for girls, which I know Karen Andrews as a keen and passionate advocate for as Science Minister.

And we've asked the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to inquire into sexual harassment in the workplace. We're fully engaged in keeping women safe by working together to combat violence against women and this is a shared and equal objective of all members of our Parliament. Too many women dying. Horrifically on average one woman every week. And far too many others suffering in silence. We've all reflected on the horrific death of Aiia Maasarwe which rocked the country and she was a guest to our country, she was a visitor to our country. But it really did shake us. It wasn't the first time this had happened, obviously. But it was an event I think that I think cried out to the country that this must stop, and stop it must.

Since 2015 we have invested more than $350 million in women's safety and on Monday I was proud to announce that the first funding to support the fourth Action Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children. A process started under the previous Government, a process passionately continued under our Government. The $78 million investment in emergency accommodation and in-home safety funding reflects two vital principles. First, we can’t ask women and children to leave dangerous homes if they had no place to go to. And where it is safe, women and children survivors should be helped remain in their homes and in their communities. They are the victims. They should not be the ones paying the price.

We'll be announcing further funding to support the Action Plan in the lead up to the release of that plan later this year. And we're also keeping women safe with the Women at Risk Visa sub-class. This was one of the first things I did when I was Minister for Immigration to lift the intake of women through our Women at Risk Program through our refugee and humanitarian program. And I'm pleased to say that since 2013, 7,046 women and children have found safe refuge in Australia since 2013. And that includes more than 2,100 in 2017-18 year alone.

It's not just about keeping women safe and their children. It's also about being able to live the economy that enables women to prosper and to flourish. An economy that determines choices and opportunities, and only a stronger economy can deliver those opportunities. A stronger Medicare, more and cheaper medicines, more affordable childcare. All of this depends on the strength of our economy and the entrepreneurs and small and family businesses right across this country which provide the prosperity for the country to live from.

And it's about jobs, because it's always about jobs at the end of the day. Whether you're leaving school, raising children, or preparing for retirement. Not having a job either yourself or within a family or being worried about losing a job robs you of those choices and of your independence. So over the last five and a half years with more than 1.2 million new jobs new have been created and more than half being taken up by women some 690,000, in fact. This is something we're very pleased to see. There are now more than 5.9 million Australian women in employment and female participation in our workforce is at record highs. We've appointed a record 45.8 per cent of government board positions to women under our Government. And the gender pay gap is moving in the right direction, now down to a record low of 14.5 per cent.

So we’re for jobs, but not just for the pay check. A job creating economy makes families stronger, communities stronger. Men and women stronger. Economic Opportunity and the greater choice and security that can come with it are at the heart of what we're seeking to achieve in our vision for a prosperous, safe and cohesive Australia. I want to thank the UN Women National Committee in Australia for hosting this breakfast today to support UN women's programs globally and to enhance the prosperity,  economic participation and safety of women in our region and around the world. I want to thank you for your attention today and I hope you will enjoy the day's proceedings and Aunty Violet, thank you again so much.PRESS CONFERENCE, CANBERRA

Border protection; Labor weakness
PRIME MINISTER: Well not surprisingly, I understand that the Senate will be passing the Bill that went through the House yesterday. Earlier today, I convened a meeting of the National Security Committee to take the decisions that were necessary following on from the contingency planning that have been put in place over the last couple of weeks. That contingency planning and the decisions I've taken this morning, together with the other NSC Ministers, is there is a range of strengthening that has been put in place in terms of Operation Sovereign Borders and their operations. I want to stress that all of the actions and decisions that we are taking are implementing the recommendations of these agencies and the officials as presented to us this morning. We are adopting all of the recommendations they have put, based on their advice in response to the decisions that have been taken in the Australian Parliament. We're implementing them all 100 per cent. Everything they are asking for, they are getting and that has involved a strengthening of the capacity of Operation Sovereign Borders across a whole range of fronts. I am not at liberty to go into the detail of what they are for obvious reasons. This Parliament has already tipped its hand enough to the people smugglers. I won't be doing that in compromising our operations and how we now address the consequences of what this Parliament is doing to our borders.

Secondly, we have approved putting in place the reopening of the Christmas Island detention facilities and a series of compounds there, both to deal with the prospect of arrivals as well as dealing with the prospect of transfers. The full cost of those was set out in the declassified briefing which you've already seen and the final costings of those will be staged over the re-ramp up of those facilities, and that is taking place in accordance with the recommendations from the Secretary of Home Affairs.

In relation to the implementation of the laws passing that are through the Senate, I've asked the Department of Home Affairs for an implementation report. I will await for that report and then take further decisions on that once I have that information available to me. My job now is to ensure that the boats don't come. My job now is to do everything within my power and in the power of the Government to ensure that what the Parliament has done to weaken our borders does not result in boats coming to Australia. It is still the case that our Government is running border protection in this country and that, of itself, is a great deterrent, because they know our resolve. The people smugglers know my resolve. They know Peter Dutton's resolve. They know we will do everything in our power to stop them at every point. And we remain standing here to ensure that they don't come.

So if they don't come, it will be because of the work and the decisions we are now taking and the actions we are putting in place. If they do come, you can thank the Labor Party and Bill Shorten because he is the one who has led this process. He has led this process to weaken and compromise our borders. Now, I want to make a couple of other points because there is a lot of misinformation and, frankly, lies, that are being put around. There are more than 60 medical professionals on Nauru, for 420 people. If that says there is no medical facilities available on Nauru, then that is ridiculous. Tell me another part of this country that has one medical professional for every seven people. There is, in fact, one medical... I should say, mental health professional for every 14 people on Nauru.

On top of that, there is no one in detention on Nauru, not one person. And, as you already know, apart from the four who will be transferred to the United States, there are no children on Nauru. None. So the Labor Party cannot absolve themselves by telling themselves lies as motivation for what they did in the Parliament yesterday and what they are doing now. They have done what they have done. Bill Shorten has done what he has done out of manifest weakness, an inability to stand up to the left wing of his own party, the Greens and others who have applied pressure. He has no strength on this issue and he cannot be trusted to follow through on any of the border protection measures that our Government has put in place.

So we are taking the decisions and the action to clean up the mess that the Labor Party has once again created and we will be undertaking all our efforts to do just that. Happy to take questions.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when you were Immigration Minister - and we hear it from Peter Dutton as well -  you often talk about the messaging that comes from the shores of Australia, whether it encourages or discourages people smuggling ventures. Don’t you as Prime Minister have the responsibility to keep a lid on your language, lest it does encourage people smugglers?

PRIME MINISTER: I’ve just delivered that message. I'm standing between people smugglers and bringing a boat to Australia. Last time I did that, you didn't get here.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you referred to lies, legitimately, before. Now your Government MPs, people like Tony Abbott, are saying that as a consequence of the Bill that passed the House yesterday, it's now: “Get on a boat, get to Nauru, get sick and get to Australia” - when the law that passed the House -

PRIME MINISTER: I’m sorry, but that’s entirely possible. That is entirely possible.

JOURNALIST: If I can finish? That... get to Australia. The law that passed the House yesterday, I don't know what will pass the Senate because it hasn't happened yet, but the law that passed the House yesterday clearly ring-fences to the current cohort. So what Mr Abbott is saying is not true.

PRIME MINISTER: No, I'm sorry Katharine, you fail to understand that people smugglers don't deal with the nuance of the Canberra bubble. They deal with the psychology of messaging, of whether things are stronger or whether things are weaker. It might be all fine and nice to talk about these nuances here in this courtyard. But when you're in a village in Indonesia and someone is selling you a product, there's no protections or truth in advertising laws for people smugglers. They just sell the message. What Tony Abbott has said is exactly what the people smugglers will be saying. Sorry, I’m going over here.

JOURNALIST: Prime, Minister, it’s not a nuance, it’s a fact. And if I may -

PRIME MINISTER: It is a nuance which the people smugglers will ignore. What is true today Katharine, what is true today is as a result of what happened in the Parliament yesterday and what is happening in the Senate now is our border protection laws are weaker than they were two days ago. That's a fact. Thank you, Phil?

JOURNALIST: If the consequences of this Bill are as dire as you are saying and require the response you have just outlined, why don't you prevent it getting Royal assent? If it's in the national interest to stop these laws going ahead, why don't you use your powers to stop getting it Royal assent?

PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe there’s an argument before us to actually advance on that front.

JOURNALIST: Can you elaborate on that?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

JOURNALIST: Why not just go to an election if you [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: We will go to an election, we'll go to an election in May. I'm not going to be intimidated by the Labor Party from handing down a surplus Budget in April. I'm not going to be intimidated by the Parliament, from distracting my attention from the things that need to be attended to, which I’ve got to tell you right now, in addition to cleaning up the mess on our borders that Labor created yesterday, my focus is also very firmly focussed on what is unfolding in North Queensland and for our cattle industry and those devastated communities. Now, I haven't heard much, I haven't heard much on that front, but I can tell you there's a lot of that being addressed in my office just in here and in our Cabinet room and my meetings with Ministers. I'm very focussed on that issue at the moment as I am on this issue and will continue to be. I'm not going to be distracted by all the frankly - I know you don't like the phrase - but the bubble nonsense of people going on about all sorts of precedents, all the rest of it. Frankly, not interested. I’ve got too many other important things to focus on.

JOURNALIST: On the banks, the request for extra sittings. If you lose a vote on that matter in the Parliament, will you have lost control of the Parliament and go to an election?

PRIME MINISTER: I'm not engaging on those sort of issues, we will continue to work our issues through the Parliament and we will deal with them as they present. We will continue to take strong action when it comes to the Royal Commission. There are matters before the Parliament even now that we're working through. We're putting in place the arrangements - which doesn't require legislation - to activate cases and go back 10 years to be considered by AFCA and many other recommendations which we’re already moving on. We’re doing just that, we're taking objection on the Royal Commission. We will continue to do that and we'll do it in a calm, responsible way.

We won't - see, I'm glad you raised this - because we're getting an insight into Bill Shorten. He has taken a reckless approach to border management. I mean, last year he had his senators vote for this bill in the form which he told us yesterday, was dangerous and required amendment. Yet he was prepared to have his own members of the House vote for it last December. A reckless act on our borders which he only doubled down on yesterday. And now he says we should recklessly prepare legislation in response to 40 recommendations, without having the opportunity to consider unintended consequences and ensure the consultation is done and this legislation is done correctly, as the Law Council has advised.

Bill Shorten has a very reckless, opportunistic approach to these serious matters. I'm not going to take that approach. That is not how I do things, we will continue to govern in a calm and responsible way and that's exactly what we're doing today. Everybody else can flap their arms about, my arms are firmly by my side and I'm very focussed on the job I have got ahead of me.

JOURNALIST: Your Government has brought I think 879 of the asylum seekers and refugees from Manus Island and Nauru to Australia on medical grounds. Wouldn't that indicate that the medical services there are inadequate, if they're not why did you bring them to Australia?

PRIME MINISTER: No, we made those decisions consistent with the transfer processes that we have and were working perfectly fine. This was my point yesterday; what was done yesterday was unnecessary. There was no need to do what was done necessary, because the processes and the medical treatment that was in place, was already there and those processes were already working and had resulted in every single child coming off Nauru.

Now, I remember when I became Immigration Minister and I visited those centres both on Manus Island and on Nauru. They were in an appalling condition. The Labor Party hadn't properly funded them. They hadn't put the right medical staff in place. Let's not forget that the Labor Party put children on Manus Island. The Labor Party put children on Manus Island - so I'm not going to take lectures on humanitarianism from a Labor Party that put children on Manus Island and left those centres in such a state of disrepair when we came to Government, that they should be absolutely ashamed of themselves and to hear, to hear yesterday Tony Burke and others in the Parliament, and Labor members who I recall in those debates came in and wept openly in the Parliament, well,  they have forgotten the tears of those days because they have repeated the mistakes that they put in place when they were in Government.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, a big part of Operation Sovereign Borders from its outset when you were in charge of it, was that you did not comment on ‘on water matters’. Will that be maintained? If a boat leaves Indonesia, will you not comment on it if it’s turned back at sea?

PRIME MINISTER: You can expect Operation Sovereign Borders to maintain all of its aspects and integrity on my watch.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Bob Katter says that he wants banking reforms separate to the Royal Commission recommendations and if you deliver that, that he won't vote for an extension of Parliament. Are you going to work with Bob Katter to try and do that?

PRIME MINISTER: I’m always working with Bob Katter and what I'm working with Bob Katter right now on, is the reconstruction of the cattle industry in northern Australia. We’ve had some excellent meetings on that and I want to thank Bob. He put a question to me yesterday on this issue and I responded in kind and we are working very closely on those issues that Bob has raised. Why? Because we should. Because the northern Australian cattle industry needs our support. This is an industry that has a huge future, but has literally been washed away in the last few days. They will need our help to get them back on their feet and that's what Bob and I are working on.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just on medevac bill I know you don’t support it, but are you willing to say to would-be asylum seekers; “This will not apply to you if you come now?”

PRIME MINISTER If we're re-elected it won't apply to anybody, because I will reverse it.

JOURNALIST: But I mean right now as Prime Minister, will you say that to the people smugglers?

PRIME MINISTER: I can only say what the law says, it's not my law. I think it's a foolish law. It's a foolish law and it's not one that I support.

JOURNALIST: For the sake deterring arrivals, would you say that it doesn’t apply to new arrivals?

PRIME MINISTER: I'll be engaging in some very direct messaging as part of Operation Sovereign Borders with people smugglers and with those who might be thinking of getting on boats. Not the first time I have done that, to send very clear messaging that my Government is in control of the borders.

As long as my Government is here, you can expect strong border protection [interrupted]. Under a Labor Government, you can expect to see them fold, like a pack of cards. Like Bill Shorten did yesterday.

JOURNALIST: Aren't you weakening that message? 

PRIME MINISTER: No.

JOURNALIST: But by not spelling out in some detail –

PRIME MINISTER: I didn’t say I'm wasn’t going to do that Michelle. I said I’ll be engaged in very clear and direct messaging to anyone who thinks they should get on a boat; I'm here and I will stop you.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Peter Dutton is very upset about this change. You talk about it happening “as a result of the actions of the Parliament”. Isn't it as a result of the actions of your Party, if Peter Dutton didn't want to be Prime Minister, you wouldn't have lost that vote yesterday?

PRIME MINISTER: That's a very long bow.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister how can you have it both ways? If you say a boat arrives, it will be Labor's fault but if it doesn't arrive, it's thanks to the Government?

PRIME MINISTER: Because that's true.

JOURNALIST: Are you in control of the borders, or not?

PRIME MINISTER: Of course I am, but what I'm saying is that the Labor Party has weakened our border protection. That is true. But what remains is the resolve and strength and conviction of my Government, myself as Prime Minister, Peter Dutton as Home Affairs Minister and that still remains a big hurdle for them to get over. But I can tell you; the bar they’ll have to clear if Bill Shorten is Prime Minister, is lower than a snake’s belly.

Thanks very much.



REMARKS, OVARIAN CANCER AUSTRALIA BREAKFAST

Photo: AAP Image/Mick Tsikas

PRIME MINISTER: Well, thank you very much for that very kind introduction, can I also welcome all of my colleagues who are here today. Can I particularly thank Kelly and Gaye for the work that you do as patrons of this very important group and of course the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt who is here. Great to see you here too Jules and you’ve been a great supporter of this cause over a long period of time. But to all my colleagues here, we join together in support of those who have also gathered here today. You often come to these things and people say; “It’s nice that you’re here,” well, there are people who are in this room today, and it’s very nice they’re here. They’re here, they’re fighting, they’re with us, they are conquering, they are overwhelming, they are demonstrating hope. Their stories are the ones that you’ve come here today to hear from, not from politicians. You are going to hear from a number of the survivors today. But they’re not only survivors, they’re conquerors. They are paving that way and providing that hope to other women and I particularly want to thank them for their courage and what you’ll hear from them today.

Can I also thank Jane Hill for her welcome and can I also thank Paula Benson who is here also today, who stepped down just a few months ago after eight years as chair. She received the Jeannie Ferris Award in 2017, which I know is something close to the hearts of all us here in Parliament who knew Jeannie who was a colleague and lost her own battle with ovarian cancer back in 2007. So thank you very much to you  Paula for the comfort you give and the leadership you’ve shown in this area over a very long period of time.

Four years ago, a friend of mine – we hadn’t known each other that well to be honest, but I know the family incredibly well – journalist and author Julia Baird was in her 40s with two young children, a book to finish, it’s a great book by the way, when suspected ovarian cancer reared its head. She described it this way;

“Your world narrows to a slit. Suddenly very little matters. If you ran 1,000 miles, aced a billion exams, hit a dozen home runs, nothing could reverse or erase the fact of cancer.”

In the tense days before surgery – a surgery that revealed thankfully that she actually had another but sadly a rarer kind of cancer, she learned a few things about life. First, that stillness and faith could give her extraordinary strength. Second, she drew her family and her tribe near. That family has been everything, that support network – and I’ve met support networks here this morning. She wrote in the New York Times;

“Those who rally and come to mop your brow when you look like a ghost, who try to make you laugh, distract you with silly stories, cook for you or even fly for 20 hours just to hug you, are companions of the highest order.”

Those who are here with you today, those who have turned up today, those who fight alongside you today - they are all companions of the highest order in the way that Julia set out, in terms of those who have stood with her and her beautiful family.

This is an insidious disease. It has the lowest survival rate of any form of cancer in Australia, as we’ve heard. It’s estimated that more than 1,500 Australian women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and this year it will claim around 1,000 lives. Unlike breast cancer, there is no early detection screening test for ovarian cancer. That’s why the work that has been done educating the public is so important and that’s why today is important. Making women aware - and men, I’ve got to say - of the signs and symptoms and giving them the best chance of catching it early, getting ahead of it, getting on top of it. That’s also why our Government has invested in the ground-breaking ‘Trace Back’ project, launched this time last year partnering with the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, we’re providing close to $3 million to trial this new approach to cancer control using genetic testing to identify women at risk.

When I made mention of this project earlier this year at the Glenn McGrath Foundation lunch in Sydney, where their challenge is obviously fighting breast cancer, there was a solidarity between those who fight breast cancer with those who fight ovarian cancer. And that received as strong as a response as all the other measures we announced for breast cancer.

I really hope this means lives will be saved. Women and families spared the worst. I’m proud that our Government is the single biggest investor in cancer research in this country. Over $1.8 billion invested over the last decade. Close to $80 million has gone into ovarian cancer research and, I’m proud to say, that we’re investing $20 billion in the Medical Research Future Fund to create one of the world’s largest medical research endowment funds. That means we’re investing in the science and the talented medical researchers and doctors who will lead the world in finding a cure. That is the dividend of the prosperous country we are and the economy that we have the good fortune to live in and that we must take keen care of to ensure that these dividends can continue.

And I’m very pleased to confirm that Health Minister Greg Hunt’s announcement that we’re making today and I’m making here, that the Australian Government will provide $1.6 million for psychological support services for women with ovarian cancer and their caregivers. And their caregivers.

[Applause]

This recognises the need for better support services for women living with ovarian cancer, particularly those in rural and remote areas of Australia. And I’ve met those women out in those stations, and they are a long way from where most of us are where they can access those services. And it’s important that these support services that go to their psychological wellbeing also reach out into those remote and regional areas where these services are just as necessary. We’ve also been successful in making treatment more accessible with more than 200 women now taking Lynparza, their drugs cost around just over $40 a script, or $6.50 for pensioners. If they weren’t subsidised through the PBS, they’d cost around $90,000 a year.

There are few, if any programs I am more proud of in our nation than the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and the fact that we can continue to invest in this Scheme. I want to commend Greg Hunt for the outstanding work that he’s done listing drug after drug after drug. This is one of the, I think, strongest achievements of our Government when it comes to healthcare in this country. We will keep listing those drugs and we’ll keep ensuring that the economy is there to support those listings. We spend close to $22 million a year on medicines to treat ovarian cancer.

So you’ve come to hear the stories of those who are battling. I hope what I’ve shared with you this morning says that we’re battling with you. We will continue to do the research, we’ll continue to provide the support, we’ll continue to fund the drugs and we’ll continue to work together to raise awareness of all Australians to be there for you, to be with you. As Julia would say, “Companions of the highest order.” Thank you.

PRIME MINISTER: G’day Ben.

BEN FORDHAM: Thank you very much for joining us on the line.

PRIME MINISTER: That’s alright, Tony was making a lot of sense there, I didn’t want to interrupt him.

FORDHAM: I thought you might have been listening in and I know you’ve had a busy afternoon, so thank you for jumping on the line and talking to us. Look, he was suggesting that this was evidence, what we’re watching today, with Bill Shorten’s support of this medevac bill, that he’s not fit to be Prime Minister. Is that a blunt and honest assessment?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it is. He hasn’t got the ticker for it when it comes to this stuff. I mean when it comes to national security, you don’t trade in it, it’s an area of pure conviction, you do things because you believe it. You don’t sort of flip and flop, which he has done here. It’s very similar to what happened with Kim Beazley all those years ago and John Howard. It’s almost like a rerun and this is the great problem I have with Labor; they can never, ever, ever learn the lesson. They think they can fiddle with this stuff, just like they did when they got rid of temporary protection visas in 2008 and now the boats come. They think; “Oh, it won’t make any difference.”

I mean Bill Shorten said; “We’re getting the balance right.” The last Labor Prime Minister who said that was Kevin Rudd and they just never, ever learn.

FORDHAM: You’ve acted as Immigration Minister, you know more about stopping boats than anyone else in Australia; will people smugglers re-start their trade because of this bill?

PRIME MINISTER: That is the great risk we’re now facing. I’m going to do everything to make sure that doesn’t happen and the only thing standing between a boat and Australia is me and Peter Dutton and our Government. They know our resolve. But if we were not there, I can guarantee you they’d be coming thick and fast, that’s what would happen. Now if one comes, it will be the result of this weakening.

I had the National Security Committee meet this morning, which I convened. We took a number of decisions to strengthen what we were doing with Operation Sovereign Borders. We’ve done that. We’ve taken now, the step – sadly – we will have to re-open the Christmas Island detention centre. That will come at a cost and we haven’t finalized those costs yet. But that’s what Labor knew would be the consequences when they did this. They just disregarded the advice of the Chief of the Defence Force, the head of ASIO, the head of the Department of Home Affairs. They just went and did it anyway.

It showed terrible weakness on Bill Shorten’s part. I mean, it’s the only way I can put it Ben it was just sheer weakness.

FORDHAM: Is it right that there’s already been a reaction in parts of the world where people smugglers ply their trade, that there’s already chatter in that part of the world?

PRIME MINISTER: That doesn’t surprise me at all, because what they look for is a change of policy. Now, we haven’t changed our policy, but what the Parliament has done is to force one upon us. That’s just how the people smugglers work. See all these journalists down here in Canberra, in the bubble, they think all these little nuances matter - and the Labor Party think it - to the people smugglers. They just turn up to someone sitting up there in Indonesia and they say: “Guess what, they changed the laws down there in Australia, you can get on a boat now. Let’s go” that’s what they do. They think they’re all sort of glued to listening to journalists down here in Canberra, explaining the intricacies of these things. It’s nonsense.

FORDHAM: I can remember a Four Corners investigation into people smugglers and some of them that were based here in Australia and that was the case.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah.

FORDHAM: I remember the interviews with some of the people and they were just saying; ‘They kept lying to us and lying to us and lying to us about where we were going, what we were doing, what would happen when we were on the boat.” That’s obviously what they do. 

PRIME MINISTER: They’re criminals. That’s what criminals do, they lie.

FORDHAM: Have our intelligence agencies actually heard any chatter though, because it’s being reported by David Speers, that he’s been told that Australia’s intelligence agencies believe that “the beast is stirring,” since the passage of the medevac bill? They’re trying to ensure that the beast doesn’t wake up, the beast of course being the people smuggling trade. Have you been told by our intelligence agencies that there is chatter?

PRIME MINISTER: I could never confirm that one way or the other Ben, because that’s intelligence that I receive as Prime Minister. So I can’t comment on that for obvious reasons, but what my job is, is to make sure that beast doesn’t wake up. I can tell you, Bill has given it a big poke, that’s what he has done. He’s done it willfully and he’s done it because he can’t stand up to the far left of his own Party. I mean you’ve got Tanya Plibersek running immigration and border protection for the Labor Party now. Just picture this for me; Bill Shorten chairing the National Security Committee with Tanya Plibersek sitting alongside him and whoever else they’ve got in there - and they are going to decide whether boats get turned back? I mean what they’ve done is, they’ve already said they’re going to give permanent visas to people who arrive illegally by boat, enter Australia illegally. They’ve already said that. They’re going to get rid of what we put back in place. They’ve now basically trashed offshore processing as we know it and they’re telling the Australian people, “Oh trust us, we’ll turn boats back.” Give me a break. Bill Shorten does not have the ticker or the mettle for that and he demonstrated that in the Parliament yesterday and if he ever tells anyone, “Oh the Coalition and us, we have the same border protection policy.” That’s complete guff. We don’t. He doesn’t have the strength for it, he doesn’t have the policies for it, he doesn’t have a clue about it.

FORDHAM: One of the issues here obviously is that when people get a medical transfer to Australia then a lot of them then launch legal actions to stay. I think out of those who have come here, more than half of them have done that, engaged lawyers and said; “Righto, I’m not going back.”

PRIME MINISTER: That’s exactly what happens, that’s exactly what happens. So look, this is why they play with this stuff thinking they can appease people in their own party. I mean, if Bill Shorten had any ticker he would have stood up to them and said; “No, no, we need to have strong borders. We said that the Coalition had got it right and that we’d stuffed it up and that we can never go back there.” That’s what he should have said. But he didn’t do that. He just rolled over. This bloke is seriously, seriously weak.

FORDHAM: I really got the sense watching you at the National Press Club that you are going to stick a stake in the ground on this and just stand to it and not budge a centimetre. And you made a call and I’m paraphrasing here, but you said; “Bill Shorten is looking for the middle ground here, but you can’t find middle ground on 1,200 people dying.” And I don’t know, it strikes me that you’ve got a very strong argument to go to the next election and also to say to people, “We don’t want to see hundreds of people drowning and dying like we saw last time.” I mean, who would risk that?

PRIME MINISTER: I remember the debates. I remember when that boat crashed up on the jagged rocks of Christmas Island. I remember the debates in the Parliament when the Labor members came in and they cried in the Parliament. The tears have run dry because their memories have gone. That’s what’s happened. They have not learned the lessons from those tragic events and they are doomed to repeat them if they’re elected.

FORDHAM: And if anyone is trying to convince you to change your mind, forget about it, it’s game on.

PRIME MINISTER: Absolutely. I mean, I know what works. I know from bitter and difficult experience what works. Because I lived it and I did it with Tony and Peter who has done it since and we’re part of that team. And we’re going to do everything we can to make sure one doesn’t come. If one does come, it’s on Bill’s head and if one doesn’t come, I can assure you it’s because they know that Peter and I and Tony, we’re all still here and we’re going to do everything we can to stop them.

FORDHAM: Prime Minister, thanks for joining us, appreciate your time.PRESS CONFERENCE CANBERRA

Border Protection
PRIME MINISTER: Less than 24 hours ago, I warned Australia that Bill Shorten would make Australia weaker and the Labor Party would weaken our border protection. That they could not be trusted to do the right thing to secure Australia. Within 24 hours, Bill Shorten and the Labor Party have proved me absolutely right.

What happened in the Parliament tonight was proof positive that Bill Shorten and the Labor Party do not have the mettle, do not have what is required and do not understand what is necessary to ensure that Australia’s border protection framework and broader national security interests can be managed, by Labor.

The Labor Party have already said that if they were elected, that they will return to the policy of providing permanent visas, permanent visas that lead to citizenship for people who arrive or enter Australia illegally. That is the first tranche of the border protection framework that we put in place in 2013. They have said that they will abolish that and they will restore providing permanent visas to people who illegally enter Australia. Tonight and, I should say, last year, the Labor Party voted - on that occasion, in the Senate, without even taking any advice when it came to the national security implications - to abolish offshore processing as we know it.

This is the second tranche of the border protection regime that we have put in place. Now, the Labor Party may want to delude themselves that what they have done tonight doesn’t do that. But that would only further demonstrate their lack of understanding about these issues. The Labor Party have shown Australia tonight that they cannot be trusted on the second of those core planks of the border protection framework that have been so successful in stopping the deaths, getting the children off Nauru, getting children out of detention, ensuring that we can restore certainty and stability to our refugee and humanitarian intake.

So, when Bill Shorten tells you and the Labor Party tells you that they can be trusted to turn back boats where it's safe to do so, I think the Australian people got their answer tonight. He can't be trusted to do that either. The Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties are not on the same page when it comes to border protection. There is no bipartisanship on this issue. The Labor Party have now clearly demonstrated that under Bill Shorten's leadership, they want to go a different path. What we saw tonight was that yet again, the Labor Party have failed to learn their lessons of failure when they have had responsibility for border protection in this country. They have demonstrated yet again, that they just don't understand how to protect Australia's borders. The importance of the outcome of protecting those borders is to ensure we avoid the human carnage of what we saw last time Labor had this opportunity.

What is particularly amazing about this circumstance is Labor have not waited until they had the opportunity to be in government; they have demonstrated it even in Opposition.

So, it is a test that the Labor Party and Bill Shorten have failed tonight.

I made it very clear that the Liberal and Nationals parties would not be budging when it came to the issue of border protection in this country. We have had to clean up this mess twice. The Labor Party, when they have the opportunity, only break what has been fixed and they have been demonstrating that again tonight in the Parliament.

So, votes will come and votes will go, they do not trouble me. Where we will always stand and what the Australian people can always trust us to do, is to have the mettle to ensure the integrity of our border protection framework.

Bill Shorten and the Labor Party demonstrated tonight that they have no such mettle. That they will easily compromise these things and they will be blown about by the winds of whatever may push them one way or the other.

He cannot be trusted on our borders and Australia cannot trust Bill Shorten to make Australia stronger. He will make it weaker.

JOURNALIST: These amendments have been passed, assuming they get, well, assent from the Senate, will the Government [inaudible] Royal assent?

PRIME MINISTER: It will follow the normal process.

JOURNALIST: Is there any updated security advice on what the amended bill would mean?

PRIME MINISTER: My job now, as Prime Minister - my job up until now, I should say - is to do everything within my power to prevent these laws that weaken our border protection, that make all of us less safe when it comes to how our borders operate and now run the very real risk of seeing the boats run again and - and believe me, every arrival is on Bill Shorten and Labor's head, every arrival, every risk is on his head –

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible].

PRIME MINISTER: No, just to answer the question David has put to me -  my job up until now has been to seek to prevent those bills passing. Those bills have gone through the House of Representatives, my job now is to work with our border protection and security agencies to do everything in my power to mitigate the damaging impact of what Labor have done tonight.

Now the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs are meeting now with our Border Protection Command to work through the contingency planning that we have been putting in place for this outcome. This outcome was not unexpected to me and as a result, we have been putting contingency planning in place. I'll have more announcements to make about the actions and decisions the Government will be taking to address now the risk and the threat that Labor and Bill Shorten have created.

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible]

PRIME MINISTER: Can everyone stop shouting.

JOURNALIST: You're saying it’s a test for Labor but surely this is a control of you test, er, the control of the House of Reps which you have lost [sic]? Is this a no confidence motion in government?

PRIME MINISTER: No, of course it isn’t and I’d refer you to Kerryn Phelps herself. That was not what that vote was about this evening. If the Labor Party want to move such a motion, they should feel free to do so and it will fail. How do I know that? Because the independents have made that very clear. So, it cannot be contorted into that type of an outcome. Indeed, it was back in 2013 - I'll reference it specifically if you like - back in February of 2013, Opposition amendments were passed, so this is just back in 2013 - Opposition amendments were passed on a superannuation legislation bill, Service Providers and other Governments Measures Bill, in very similar, if not the exact same circumstances as these. The minority Government, which was a Labor Government at the time, was defeated. So as for the historical precedents, I think there has been a lot of hyperbole about these things.

JOURNALIST: But do you regard it –

PRIME MINISTER: I’ll just finish answering the question - the historical precedents need to be put into some context. So, when I made the remarks I did earlier in the week, this is not a matter that goes to the issues that you've raised. That's why it's not a matter I intend to act on with those types of consequences.

I'm going to get about the business that I'm about every day and that is to ensure we strengthen our economy, we make Australia more secure and we keep Australians together and we do the job we were elected to do.

JOURNALIST: Have you discussed this with General Cosgrove, you know, this scenario that this could occur?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

JOURNALIST: PM, under OSB, when boats come to Australia it usually takes us months, sometimes years to find out if they have arrived. Will you…

PRIME MINISTER: No, we know pretty much straightaway when they have arrived.

JOURNALIST: Well we don't sometimes find out how many boats have arrived because it has been a secret. So if a boat comes from tomorrow or the next day, will you tell the Australian people that one is on its way?

PRIME MINISTER: I'll tell the Australian people I'll do exactly what I told them I was going to do going into the 2013 election, and that is I will let Operation Sovereign Borders run the operations of that command. And they will do what is right and in Australia's interests and that's what I will do every single day.

JOURNALIST: Those contingency plans you talk about, does that include extra patrols? Is there specific intelligence out of Indonesia that the people smuggling...

PRIME MINISTER: You wouldn't expect me to comment on that. What I am telling you though is contingency plans have been put in place. The Ministers are now directly engaged with the operations side of OSB to be putting those in place and further decisions will be announced as and when that is deemed appropriate.

JOURNALIST: It’s not to frustrate the medical transfers from offshore detention, is it?

PRIME MINISTER: What I'm saying is that our operations will continue, as they always do and they'll be done in the way that they're always done. The Bill that is making its way to the Senate will follow its normal process and including through to Royal ascent. The Government will move to operate in accordance with the laws of the country. That's what governments must do. But what I will also do is make sure I take every action I can to ensure that Australia's border protection is not compromised.

JOURNALIST: If the Parliament's delivering laws that you don't agree with and you think create such a risk, then why not go to the polls and get a mandate to ensure that you can keep the policies that you think, and laws that should be in place, and call an election now.

PRIME MINISTER: There'll be the opportunity for that in May and the Australian people will have opportunity to decide on, not only these issues in May. Because Bill Shorten and the Labor Party have made it crystal clear that, at the next election, Australians will be deciding once again, once again, as they did in 2013, as they did in 2001, about whether they want the stronger border protection policies of the Liberal and National Parties or they want the weaker border protection policies of the Labor Party and in 2001 and in 2013, I thought they sent a very clear message.

JOURNALIST: Given the defeat in the House just earlier, do you now accept or prepare yourself for the possibility of extra sitting weeks before the election?

PRIME MINISTER: Those matters haven't been considered by the Parliament yet and we'll deal with those when they are.

JOURNALIST: Do you have a contingency plan for an early election?

PRIME MINISTER: The election will be in May after the Budget.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you regard the legislation of the amendments that passed the House of Representatives tonight as a matter of vital importance?

PRIME MINISTER: I've already said that these are not matters that go to issues of confidence and I don't consider them in those terms. The Government has never put them in those terms and the Independent members who voted on this Bill this evening did not consider them in those terms, which is related to the form of words that you've just put to me.

JOURNALIST: The changes that Labor agreed to will allow the Minister to reject people with serious criminal records. Can you just explain to us what is the main concern here now is?

PRIME MINISTER: Right now - I should say - still right now, the Bill has not gone through the Senate. The provisions that relate to character, the provisions that relate to criminal conduct and all of these are stronger than what has gone to the Parliament tonight. So it is, as I said, there was no form of this Bill that made our borders stronger and, frankly, there was no form of this Bill that made it more humane. There are more than 60 medical professionals and medical-related staff on Nauru. More than 60, per head of population, in terms of those they are treating, you will find that to be greater than any part of this country. There are no children on Nauru, other than the four that have their bags packed to go to the United States. So don't kid yourself out there, to the Labor Party and those who voted for this Bill today and those who will do it in the Senate. Don't kid yourself that somehow you have improved the situation - you've only made it weaker. And what you've done today is say to the Australian people, and Bill Shorten in particular and the Labor Party, that you're prepared to trade on these issues. Trade on these issues to compensate for your very real weakness and the Australian people have looked at Bill Shorten today and they have found him weak and he is. Thank you.



REMARKS, COALITION JOINT PARTY ROOM

PRIME MINISTER: Over the summer, Australians have had some very difficult times. It's been a privilege to be with colleagues, with Australians in the midst of these difficult times. We've had fires in Tasmania, we've had fires in Victoria, we’ve had fires in Western Australia. We've had floods in northern Australia, in particular in Townsville and we are now witnessing a full-scale national disaster - national disaster - of what is happening in Northern Queensland. And I want to particularly commend Linda Reynolds for the way that she has, not only managed and coordinated those efforts and particularly Linda thank you to the Australian Defence Force who have been there not just to do the work but to provide that great encouragement to Australians just by their sheer presence of turning up, but I want to thank you for the work you’ve done with emergency management to prepare. Because we knew it was going to be a difficult season with bushfires and to have the aerial assets ready and in place, I want to commend you for that. And to Michael Keenan and the work that has been done by Human Services to ensure that the payments have been getting out. I mean, just as of last Sunday as I said at the Press Club yesterday, almost $40 million in cash support within a week to get support to those families. That’s government in action, that’s government dealing with issues that the Australian people are facing and Michelle, I know, you have seen the same thing in your electorate.

You know, Australians are strong. Australians are resilient. And under our Government, we’re going to continue to make Australia even stronger. That’s what we’re about. A stronger economy, stronger borders, stronger services. That’s a stronger Australia and that’s what we’re doing. Our opponents have plans that will make Australia weaker. To weaken the economy, to weaken our borders, and you can’t pay for services with money that’s not there, and we all know Labor cannot manage money.

So here we are colleagues, taking up this fight on behalf of a strong Australian people. Backing them in, backing small business, lower taxes, the infrastructure they need. Whether it’s supporting farmers in drought or supporting farmers in flood - we are there and we’ll be there not just in the crisis and the recovery, but we’ll be there for their prosperity in the future.     Because those days will come and we believe in that and we believe in them. So that is our charge, that is our mission, and we are united together in doing that.

But before I go any further, there has been one element in our team that has been missing. And his name is Arthur Sinodinos.

[Applause]

And Arty, why don’t you say a few words mate.

SENATOR ARTHUR SINODINOS: Thanks PM. All I’m going to say is, first and foremost, when I have been out there talking to our people as I have come back to work, there is a real fighting spirit out there. A view that we can win this. And as long as we provide a clear alternative, articulate that alternative and work as a team, we will get there. We can win this. The only other plea I’d make is Michael McCormack, no more singing.

[Laughter]

PRIME MINISTER: Well, let’s get to work. Thank you very much.

[Applause]DOORSTOP, CANBERRA ACT

PRIME MINISTER: I was pleased to be here this morning. As you heard, I give thanks for the answered prayers of so many Australians that Hakeem is coming home, we had confirmation of course of that overnight. We have seen the picture of him on the plane, with a smile on his face, and that’s great to see. And I particularly again want to thank the Thai Government for working with us so closely. I also want to thank the Bahrain Government for our interactions with them as well. We have excellent relationships with both of countries, but the best news of all is Hakeem will be in Australia this afternoon and I think that’s something we can give great thanks for and give great acknowledgment to all the fine work that’s been done by our officials, our Australians of the Year, everyone who has been involved. I thank them all very much.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if you lose the medevac Bill today, why should you not drive to Government House and call an election?

PRIME MINISTER: It’s not a matter [inaudible], that’s why. I mean, the independents have said that themselves. So I think they’ve answered their own question. That matter will be determined I assume later in the Parliament today. I have made it pretty clear that the Bill is acceptable in no form. We will not be giving any comfort or any licence for the Parliament to support this in any way, shape or form.

JOURNALIST: Will you allow it to come on for a debate today though?

PRIME MINISTER: It does come on for a debate today, that’s the process.

JOURNALIST: So you will consider absolutely no Labor amendments to this Bill whatsoever?

PRIME MINISTER: This Bill is acceptable in absolutely no form. It only weakens our borders, it does not strengthen them. I will not give a leave pass to this Parliament to weaken our borders. Thanks very much.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you for joining us. I’ll make a statement as will the Foreign Minister, we don’t plan to take questions on this this evening, it’s just to advise you where things are at and we’ll be issuing a formal statement in the morning. But what we can advise is that as a result of a decision of the Thai Government not to pursue the extradition case that is reported, that Hakeem al-Araibi has left jail and is on his way to the airport. Now the next step is for him to return home. But as it always is in these cases, people aren’t home until they’re home.

But what we’d like to do tonight is to thank and show our appreciation to the Thai Government for the decision that they have taken today. We greatly respect the process that they’ve had to work through and we greatly appreciate their listening to the issues that have been raised by our Government and many others who have raised this case. These issues are complex and our relationship with the Thai Government and in particular with Prime Minister Prayut, is very strong. We thank them for the way that they have engaged with us on this matter now, for some period of time. I also want to thank – and the Foreign Minister will add further to this – all of those Australians who have been so supportive of Hakeem. Those who have provided direct support to him personally, particularly Craig Foster who has very much championed his case and cause and I have spoken to him and Marise has spoken to him on many occasions, we’ve worked closely together.

But there is still a journey ahead, there is still a process to be followed. But we are very grateful for the relationship we have with the Thai Government that has enabled us to work through these issues in the way that we have. I particularly want to commend the Foreign Minister for the work that she has done and that all of our consular officials have done. These issues are very delicate, they’re very sensitive and I think what we’ve seen here is the professionalism of our foreign service on show. So we thank them very much for all of their work and all of their advice.

As Prime Minister I’m pleased Hakeem is coming home and I’ll be pleased to see him at home when that occurs. But until that happens, we’ll continue to work this process as you would expect us to, not taking anything for granted and doing so in a way that is deeply appreciative and respectful to the Thai Government. Marise?

MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SENATOR THE HON MARISE PAYNE: Thank you very much, Prime Minister. Ladies and gentlemen, it is correct to say that there are a number of steps to go in this process. But the important thing is to acknowledge this evening that Hakeem al-Araibi has been released from prison in Thailand and all things going according to plan, he’s in the process of moving to the Bangkok Airport for the purposes of ultimately boarding a flight back to Australia and returning to his family in the next day.

There is a great deal of work that has gone on, both behind the scenes and necessarily very publicly in this process. But I did want to, as the Prime Minister has, acknowledge the extremely hard work of the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the post in Bangkok who have personally and directly worked closely to support Hakeem during this extremely difficult time and provided a level of consular support and engagement with him to support him through this process.

I want to thank my counterpart in the Thai Government, Foreign Minister Don with whom I met personally in Bangkok last month and also Deputy Prime Minister Prajin, who have engaged with me on these issues and other members of the Thai Government and the Prime Minister has acknowledged Prime Minister Prayut in Thailand. The Australian community has also played a significant role, from the leadership of Craig Foster and his many followers, to the Pascoe Vale Football Club itself.

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Which has become, I think, well-known as a football association in Australia and to many other Australian sportspeople who have taken up the cause for Hakeem in this process.

PRIME MINISTER: And of course our Australians of the Year.

MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: And indeed, our Australians of the Year who have both recently written to the Thai Government. Also I want to acknowledge the efforts here of the FFA, the Football Federation of Australia, their international director Mark Falvo who has helped my office and my team with this process. I look forward very much to seeing Hakeem al-Araibi back in Australia with his wife, with his friends, with his family and acknowledge the work that has been done between Australia and Thailand to achieve this outcome. It has been a complex process and has taken a great deal of communication and engagement, but we have an outcome. I think for Hakeem al-Araibi and the many who have supported him, that is the most important thing this evening.

As the Prime Minister has said, we’ll be issuing a formal statement in the morning but we did want to provide you with this information tonight.

PRIME MINISTER: So there’s nothing really further that we can add to that statement tonight. I want to thank you for coming together and we look forward to seeing you home, Hakeem. Thank you.

REMARKS, LAST POST CEREMONY

Photo: AAP Image/Lukas Coch

PRIME MINISTER: We meet here today on the land of the Ngunnawal People and we acknowledge their elders past, present and emerging. I also acknowledge here today the serving men and women of our Australian Defence Forces and any veterans who are present here today. I simply say thank you for your service.

We gather in the most sacred location in our Commonwealth. Madame Parly, who I welcome today, it’s wonderful to have you with us on this important occasion. A century ago, the families of the 60,000 men and women who died in the First World War had no place to mourn. For many, it was almost impossible to imagine heading to France or Gallipoli or to Egypt. So this hallowed place became where Australians would mourn and remember those who were lost.

Today many of our Members and Senators are gathered here for the Last Post. We do so to remind ourselves that our affiliation is first to our country. Tomorrow, the chambers, halls and corridors of Parliament House will spring to life again, with the resumption of a new parliamentary year. But in this moment, we stand together, quiet and aligned. The founders of this capital ensured that the Australian War Memorial was built in a direct line of sight with the Parliament. It was done so to remind every single member that no decision should be taken lightly and that some decisions exact an incalculable cost. No cost runs deeper than the loss of life inflicted by war. The freedoms and values that Australians hold dear, the right to debate and determine our destiny in that House across the lake, have been hard-fought and hard-won, through courage, mateship, sacrifice and endurance.

Gallipoli, Kokoda, Long Tan, Uruzgan, the skies over Germany, the waters of the Pacific. The names of these places are etched, written on these walls. But there is one that we particularly remember today; in September 1941, Sister Alma May Beard left Australia for Singapore, with the other gallant nurses of the 13th Australian General Hospital. She never came home. Her fate was one of the most cruel and barbaric of any man, woman or child who perished in that war. An evacuee on the Vyner Brooke who escaped drowning when it was bombed, only to be captured, held prisoner and then slaughtered on the beach. A nurse, whose only motivation was to help and care for others. It is right that we remember her, and tell her story today. Her story, like all the others, kept here in this sacred place, speaks to us of how much has been laid down. We owe every member of our armed forces past and present our gratitude for their commitment to act in our name. Here, the parliamentarians who have gathered, are reminded of our great responsibility. We remember, and we dedicate ourselves once again to this country that we love and those who have served and lost so much.

Lest we forget.

PRIME MINISTER: Well thank you Sabra and thank you for the welcome here today and can I acknowledge the Ngunnawal people, elders past present and emerging.

Can I thank the members of the press gallery for being here today. As one of them remarked to me today, “Welcome back to the bubble.” Thank you very much for the welcome.

To all of my colleagues who are here with me today, thank you. There are too many to mention but I’m so pleased that you are able to be joining me here for today’s important address talking about a safer Australia.

A few weeks ago, I had the great privilege as Prime Minister of awarding Kate and Tick Everett the honour of being Local Hero Australians of the Year.

Now, Kate is with us here today, she’s up the back. Give her a round of applause. Every Australian parent can only try and begin to imagine the pain of Kate and Tick when they lost their daughter Dolly to online bullying just over a year ago.

Through Dolly’s dream, they are transforming what I can only describe as indescribable grief into a force for change to protect the children of our country.

For parents, security used to mean warnings of ‘stranger danger’ and keeping an eye on the kids as they played in the front yard or on the nature strip.

The online world has opened up a dangerous place for our children. It is the terror of parents everywhere, including Jen and me.

Just over a week before that, I met Saeed. He is the father of Aiia Maasarwe.

Aiia was a kind hearted, beautiful and generous human being who was brutally raped and murdered in Melbourne only a few weeks ago. It’s not the first time we have seen terrible acts like that.

Now, Saeed and I are from different nations, different faiths, different cultures, but we share one thing in common. And that is understanding the special place a daughter has in her father’s heart. And I can tell you, nothing prepares you for a meeting like that.

But despite his pain, Saeed reminded Australians to “see light in the dark” because that’s what Aiia believed.

But the other truth is that women in Australia are still the targets of violence, abuse and disrespect. And this must stop.

Last year I also visited the scene where a radical extremist Islamic terrorist murdered Sisto Malaspina on Bourke Street in Melbourne. Sisto was rushing to the aid of the man who became his murderer.

An act of violence not just against a fellow Australian, but against our very way of life and who we are.

And just this past week, as Linda Reynolds and I were together, we stood with those who had been fighting fires in Tasmania down there in the Huon Valley, and we stood with the families returning to their flooded homes in Townsville.

Across the range, farmers were being hit with something they had never seen in their lifetimes and the lifetimes of generations prior to that. The loss of their livelihoods as hundreds of thousands of cattle were washed away or died stranded in flooded mud.

It’s heartbreaking. Soul destroying. And it’s still happening right now, those animals are dying as we speak. And Linda and I and other ministers were on the phone to the mayors this morning once again.

That same week I joined hundreds in Melbourne to remember the Black Saturday bushfires, and we’ll do that again in Parliament tomorrow, where families still grieve and communities are still healing ten years on.

And just before Christmas, I had the great privilege of visiting our troops in Iraq.

Australians putting themselves in harm’s way to stabilise a land far away from here. But there they serve, as Christopher Pyne knows, who saw them in January, bravely and gladly in our nation’s interests.

I’ve told you those stories because the point I want to make is that keeping Australians safe and secure is not just about discussing the great geopolitical tensions of our time.

It’s much more personal than that. It’s much more meaningful than that. It affects your every day, it extends to our communities, our families, women, children and individual Australians.

That’s how I see my national security and safety responsibilities to the Australian people.

For the past five and a half years, our Government has taken these responsibilities extremely seriously, dealing with the world as it is. Uncertain, often dangerous, uncompromising and, at its worst, simply evil.

Every day we have been taking action to build a stronger and even more resilient Australia to deal with whatever comes at us.

That’s why today I am releasing our forward plan to keep Australians safe and secure in the future. Our plan to keep Australians safe and secure.

The plan builds on our achievements and addresses the newer and emerging threats we face. Plans must always be updated to achieve that.

Regional tensions between the world's great powers, heightened global instability; stiff headwinds facing, as Josh Freedenberg knows as Treasurer, the global economy, and Mathias Cormann; foreign interference; radical Islamist terrorism; people smuggling; natural disasters; organised crime; money laundering; biosecurity hazards, cybersecurity; the evil ICE trade; violence against women on our streets; online predators and scammers who seek to rip off older Australians; cyber-bullying and elder abuse.

Our plan to Keep Australians safe and secure, to address these threats, is straightforward.

Keep our economy strong to provide the surest foundation for our security.
Defend Australia with a record investment of over $200 billion in our nation’s defence capability over the next decade.
Continue to protect our borders with proven policies that work and not changing them.
Keeping Australians safe from terrorism, by disrupting and denying terrorists the ability to undertake attacks in Australia.
Combat violence against women and counter the culture of disrespect towards women that can lead to that violence.
Protect our children online and in the real world, going after sexual predators and countering bullying behaviour.
Secure our region and our sovereignty by prioritising cooperation with our Indo-Pacific neighbours and family, as Marise Payne does on a daily basis.
To protect Australians from organised criminals by ensuring we give police and security services the resources, technology and the powers that they need.
To fight the menace of drugs – especially ICE, with coordinated law enforcement and anti-gangs initiatives.
And to protect our communities in times of natural disaster by continuing to invest more in our preparedness and capability, so we can respond quickly and help Australians get back on their feet as we are doing even as we speak right now with the disasters that face us.
So let’s talk about that plan in a bit more detail. Economic strength and our country’s security are interdependent. You can’t have one without the other.

That’s why, a fortnight ago, I released our Plan for a Stronger Economy, up in Trevor Evan’s electorate in Brisbane.

It’s also a straightforward plan. A plan for lower taxes and strong budgets. Backing small and family businesses and building the infrastructure that we need to support our growth and maintain our quality of life. In particular that congestion-busting infrastructure that Alan Tudge has been putting together all around the country.

It’s a plan that has already generated more than one million jobs in less than five years, ahead of what we promised.

It’s a plan that will deliver the essential services that Australians rely on into the future, and it’s a plan that’ll deliver a million and a quarter more jobs as our pledge over the next five years.

But it’s also a plan that will ensure that we can underwrite our Government’s commitment to keeping Australians safe and secure.

This is our objective. This is our plan.

Australia’s national security is also intertwined with that of the Indo-Pacific region.

Australia and our partners face diverse security threats that challenge our interests, from North Korea’s long-range missiles and nuclear programs, to state fragility, and radical Islamist terrorism in our own region.

We want to see an open, rules-based Indo-Pacific where the rights of all states are respected.  

So my Government, our Government is strengthening our partnerships in the region and beyond, to protect our security and our sovereignty, consistent with the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper.

Our step-up in the Pacific reflects a simple reality - the Pacific is our home and our Pacific neighbours are our family. They are fuh mouh, they are vuvale, as we’ve spoken about in the region.

We are working with our neighbours and others to support the Pacific’s long-term stability and economic prospects, by re-focusing our aid budget on our neighbourhood, and supporting infrastructure development and bolstering maritime security capability, just to name a few.

When we took office in 2013 coming into government, Defence spending was at an all-time low. In 2012-13, as a share of our economy, it was just 1.56 per cent - the lowest level since 1938. Shameful.

Under our Government, we are delivering the biggest rebuild of our armed forces and their capability in a generation, and boosting Defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP by 2020-21 ahead of our promise.

The rebuild is based on the strategy laid out in our 2016 Defence White Paper - investing over $200 billion in our defence capability over the next decade.

A doubling of the submarine fleet, a new fleet of nine frigates, as well as a new fleet of 12 offshore patrol vessels and 21 Pacific Patrol Boats.

All 54 vessels will be built here in Australia - built by Australian workers with Australian steel.

It is one of the biggest naval transformations occurring anywhere in the world today - a stark contrast, I must say, with Labor’s failure to commission a single naval vessel when they were in office for six years. Asleep at the wheel.

And earlier today, Chris Pyne and I, together with other ministers who were there, signed our Strategic Partnership Agreement with the French Defence Minister which delivers on our commitment to build 12 new submarines. And Steven Marshall, the Premier of South Australia, had a particularly big smile on his face, as he should. But so should all Premiers, because this work extends right around the country.

The Air Force will gain unprecedented combat capacity through the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.

And the Army is getting new body armour, weapons, night fighting equipment and new Armoured Reconnaissance Vehicles, which I know 3rd Brigade up there in Lavarack, Townsville are very, very excited about, particularly Brigadier Winter.

Operation Sovereign Borders has been one, I would argue, of Australia’s greatest national security policy successes.

I have had the privilege to lead it, as has Peter Dutton. I know what compromise and poorly thought through changes can do to our borders. Labor proposes to do both, again. They have learned nothing from their failures on border protection.

Our successful border protection framework has three core elements, and you’ve heard me say it before, but it bears repeating.

First, the denial of permanent residence and therefore citizenship to people who illegally enter Australia.

This was achieved by the restoration of temporary protection visas when we came to government. Labor has promised to abolish them.

When Labor did this in August 2008, thinking it would make no difference, it fired the starter’s gun for the boats to return, and the deaths, and the tragedy and the chaos.

Secondly, regional processing of people who seek to illegally enter Australia.

This is conducted at the Nauru regional processing facilities.

Labor have already voted in the Senate, as you know, to undermine these arrangements by removing authority for transfers to Australia from the Government. They will abolish regional processing as we know it.

And thirdly, disrupting people smuggling activities through the supply chain, as General Molan and I know as we did all those years ago, right up that chain using a web of intelligence and regional cooperation and the physical turn-back of boats.

Operation Sovereign Borders has worked, it’s delivered a human dividend that is both compassionate and fair.

We’ve stopped the deaths at sea – there were over 1,200 that we know of;
We’ve closed 19 detention centres;
We’ve removed all children from detention - remember over 8,000 were put into detention under the previous government - and the last four children on Nauru have their bags packed for the US. All the children are off Nauru;
We’ve expanded our humanitarian program;
And here’s some figures you might not have heard. Right from the outset, and I did this, as did Peter and David Coleman now following, we have expanded our Women at Risk program, which has seen 7,046 women and children find safe refuge in Australia since 2013.
That’s what strong border protection delivers when it comes to human beings.

Our plan is simple. We won’t change it, not one jot. Labor will.

Our Government will also continue to do everything that must be done to combat radical extremist Islamist terrorism.

So far our record includes 12 tranches of national security legislation passed.

But I’ve got to say, on almost every occasion, Labor has been dragged to support this vital legislation and then only, having sought to water it down, try and claim bipartisanship.

$2.2 billion in extra funding for our law enforcement, intelligence and security agencies. Restoring what was stripped away.

Funding for 100 more intelligence experts, over 100 more tactical response and covert surveillance operators and almost 100 forensic experts at the AFP.

$294 million to upgrade airport security around the country, including in regional airports, and $45 million in programs to counter radicalisation.

The creation of a new Office of National Intelligence and the Home Affairs Department, the expansion of the Australian Cyber Security Centre, and a significant boost in resources, all of this will ensure that our security agencies are stronger and better coordinated and integrated.

In the wake of the Burke Street terrorist attack, I decided more needed to be done when it came to countering radicalisation. I met with Muslim leaders in Sydney and I have since approved another $14 million, working with David Coleman as the Minister for Multicultural Affairs, for additional programmes to work with local community organisations and Muslim leaders who are prepared to take a stand. These are brave people, to prevent radicalisation destroying their own communities.

But the achievement we can take most comfort from is that since 2014, our security agencies have disrupted 14 major terrorist plots.

90 people have been charged with counter-terrorism offences, and hundreds of Australian families have loved ones with them - instead of facing grief, pain and loss because of the excellent work of our security agencies.

And under laws passed by our Government, we have stripped 12 terrorists of Australian citizenship.

That’s what keeping Australia safe looks like.

We might not thwart every attempt by terrorists to damage our democracy, but we have put our intelligence and security services on the best possible footing to do so.

Our Government is also fully engaged in working together to combat violence against women. And I acknowledge Kelly O’Dwyer who is here today, and I acknowledge the work she has done, as well as Paul Fletcher in this area as the Minister for Social Services.

As I said before, it must stop.

Nearly ten years  ago, state and federal governments came together with the community to put in place the first National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and Children.

The Fourth Action Plan will be finalised in the middle of this year.

But where immediate action is needed we have delivered, including committing a further $20 million just in the past year for 1800RESPECT.

Today I am announcing the first of the Commonwealth measures towards the Action Plan - a $60 million investment in emergency accommodation and $18 million of continued support for state and territory governments to keep women and children safe in their homes.

These two measures reflect two important principles, and I can reflect on this back from my time in Social Services Minister, as Paul knows very well.

We can’t ask women and children to leave dangerous homes if they have no place to go. And where it is safe, women and children survivors should be helped to remain in their homes and in their communities. You’ve got to be safe in your own home.

We have listened to the frontline workers and survivors throughout the consultations we have had over the past year.  

That is why one focus of our measures also we’ll be announcing soon will be on prevention - on changing the attitudes to violence, and on helping those who think violence is an option, to stop.

This new commitment will build on the more than $350 million our Government has invested since 2015 to stop this violence against women and children.

Our Government has also been at the forefront of efforts to keep children safe online with over $100 million invested so far.

Mitch Fifield will know that we’ve done this with the creation of the world’s first eSafety Commissioner who has tough powers to take down cyberbullying content, by funding new resources to support parents, and are making a new $10 million investment to allow charities like the Alannah and Madeline Foundation and the Carly Ryan Foundation to develop new tools to protect children online.

We have passed Carly’s Law that makes it a crime for an adult to use carriage services in relation to sexual activity with a minor.

And we have provided almost $69 million to establish the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation, which is a national approach led by the AFP, championed by Peter Dutton, to combat a global epidemic of child abuse. We’re serious about this stuff, we are very serious.

Our Government will continue to take action also to protect Australians from criminals.

Across my time as Immigration Minister and on Peter Dutton’s watch and now on David’s watch, we have cancelled the visas of the equivalent of the gaol population of South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory combined.

We have cancelled the visas of 4,150 dangerous criminals, sent them packing. In six years, Labor cancelled just 643 visas. Labor were soft.

We cancelled around 800 last year alone.

That included 13 murderers, 34 rapists and sex offenders, 53 for domestic violence, 56 for armed robbery, and 100 child sex offenders, punted by our Government.

Specifically, we have cancelled the visas of more than 300 child sex offenders and stopped hundreds more at the border.

We have introduced a national approach to strip criminals of their illegally obtained wealth no matter which jurisdiction they operate in, which strikes at the heart of organised crime. And I particularly acknowledge Michael Keenan for his work when he was Minister on those issues.

We’re giving our law enforcement agencies the tools to read the encrypted messages that violent criminals and child sex offenders are currently using to evade detection, and we had to fight for it in the Parliament to make sure we got it. We are also seeking to legislate to ensure that police have appropriate powers to assess and disrupt potential security and criminal threats at airports.  

Our Government is taking an uncompromising approach to fighting the menace of drugs.

Last financial year, the AFP and Australian Border Force seized more than 17 tonnes of drugs and precursors at the border.

The AFP assisted its international counterparts to seize more than 28 tonnes of drugs and precursors offshore. All of these efforts are protecting lives from being destroyed by drugs in our communities.

The scourge of ICE is one that I know affects communities right across Australia, not least the families and children of ICE addicts.  

The Government has invested $450 million to help these communities fight the impacts of ICE, including funding for more than 220 Local Drug Action Teams.  

Our joined-up strategy includes international cooperation to stop drugs at their source, with enhanced intelligence sharing, as well as better controls on precursor chemicals and stronger law enforcement.  

In total, we are also providing more than $720 million over four years to help communities reduce the impact of drug and alcohol misuse. Forgive me for listing such a long list of actions, but there’s a long list there in terms of what we’ve been doing.

But finally, let me talk about natural disasters. It’s our job, together with States and Territories and local government, to support Australians when nature doesn’t.

We are investing in our national emergency capability and resilience through the government’s Preparing Australia Package – with support for emergency text alerts, aerial firefighting and bushfire shelters, which have come in very useful, as Linda and I have seen in recent weeks and months.

At the national level we have contracted over 130 aerial firefighting assets for this season, bringing the total to over 500 aerial assets available when state resources are counted.

Emergency Management Australia administer, on average, about $1 billion in disaster recovery payments each year, as well as operate our 24/7 Crisis Coordination Centre.  

Our Government is also now funding up to 75 per cent of disaster assistance to individuals and communities, most of which is provided through State and Territory Governments. So up there in Townsville at the moment, those state agencies that are providing payments, 75 per cent of that is being funded by the Commonwealth Government, not just the individual payments that we do on top of that.

And once again we have seen the best of Australians in response to these recent fires and floods. It’s no surprise, but it never loses how impressive it is.

And I particularly want to thank, on behalf of our country all of the volunteer emergency services personnel, to state and territory governments, to the ADF, who have just been doing an extraordinary job, an extraordinary job, all around the country, for all that they have done. It’s just not what they do, it’s when they show up, it lifts the spirits of those who need help.

As of 5pm yesterday, over 32 thousand claims for disaster relief payments have been processed in Townsville alone, in just one week. And we have already paid over $39 million in assistance, just in one week. That’s cash straight into the pockets of those impacted by the floods.  

Further, effective 11am today, we have extended the availability of disaster recovery payments to eight shires across Western Queensland - the funds will start flowing immediately and Centrelink are putting people on the ground ready to process it immediately.

This morning I again spoke, as I said, with the mayors of the flood impacted shires in Western Queensland where we are seeing a national disaster unfold in terms of damage to our beef and cattle industries.

As a result, and further to my announcement of Category D assistance, which is national disaster status - there is no technical national disaster declaration in any act. Category D is what it is, there is a national disaster unfolding in northern Queensland. And we announced that assistance on Friday, and today I am announcing that my Government will provide an immediate ex-gratia payment of $1 million to each of the affected shires. That is necessary for them to just get on and do the enormous amount of work they need to support their communities. They raised it with me this morning, it’s announced by this afternoon.

This payment will be for them to use on the priorities that they deem most urgent - whether that be rate relief for impacted properties, reconstruction of infrastructure, or the disposal of cattle that have perished, which is being coordinated and also assisted by the ADF.

Our disaster assistance funding to North Queensland in response to this flood is already over $100 million, in addition to massive support from the ADF.

I want those farmers to know up there in North Queensland that we will stand with them all the way through this disaster, but we will be standing with you on the other side as you rebuild the great prosperity that we know is there for you in the future. We will be there to rebuild with you.

So in conclusion, national security is all about making the right decisions. Because, as a Government and as a Prime Minister, you make them every single day.

You make these decisions - this is how I make them - based on your values, what you believe, your instincts, your experience and, when required, courage.

Our Government has demonstrated we have the mettle to make the right calls on our nation’s security:

Repairing our borders;
Investing in our defence forces;
Deporting violent criminals;
Taking on domestic violence to protect the women and children in this country;
Disrupting terrorist attacks.
We have led, we haven’t followed.

We have taken decisions rather than put them off to another day.

And we have embraced tough calls rather than seeking to buy weak compromises for the purpose of politics.

This is our form, not just of our Government. But as Michael McCormack knows, the Deputy Prime Minister, the form of Liberal National Coalition Governments going back 70 years.

It is why we are trusted.

The plan I have announced today is built on our strong record and sets out plainly what a re-elected Morrison Liberal Nationals Government will continue to do to keep Australians safe and secure.

REMARKS, STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP SIGNING

Photo: AAP Image/Lukas Coch

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you very much for that introduction and can I begin by acknowledging the Ngunnawal People, elders past and present and emerging. I also extend a very warm welcome to Minister Florence Parly, it’s wonderful to have you here with us today. I know you’ve made a special effort to be here with us today and I think that’s a mark of the wonderful relationship that has been formed as we’ve moved to this day and so thank you so much for making the effort to be here today and please pass on my kindest regards to President Macron. This is a day, as I was just mentioning to you, that he and I have been looking forward to as we discussed when we were in Buenos Aires not too long ago.

To his Excellency Christophe Penot, thank you very much for all of your efforts in bringing us to this point today, working so closely. To the Premier of South Australia Steven Marshall, it’s always good to see your smiling face whether in Canberra, South Australia, it’s wonderful to have Steven here, such a passionate advocate for this programme. To my ministerial colleagues who are joining us today, particularly the Minister for Defence Christopher Pyne, congratulations Christopher on your stewardship of this programme over a long period of time and it’s wonderful that we can join together with your other ministerial colleagues who are here today to mark this important occasion.

This really is a great day for Australia. It’s a great day for our Royal Australian Navy. I reckon it’s the greatest partnership between Australia and France since Nancy Wake was let loose on the Nazis in the Second World War. It really is a wonderful partnership. The Australian Government regards the safety and security of its people and its territory as our greatest duty and calling. As ‘a land girt by sea’, as our national anthem proclaims, a great Australian Royal Australian Navy is what is necessary.

What that means is that ensuring we are at the front of the pack when it comes to the latest naval vessels and firepower. As part of our Government's plan to keep Australians safe, we’re celebrating a milestone today with the next phase of our Future Submarine Program. In 2016 the Government selected France and Naval Group as our international partners to deliver a 12 strong fleet of cutting-edge submarines, as we promised to do. The signing today of the Strategic Partnership Agreement to deliver these submarines underscores the longstanding and strategic partnership between Australia and France.

A spirit of defence cooperation and collaboration between our nations reaches right back to the First World War. But this program brings a new depth to that partnership through a multi-decade program to build and sustain these submarines in Australia. It’s more than a contract.

This is a project that will not only keep Australians safe, but it will deliver Australian jobs. It will build Australian skills. It will be made and require Australian steel and it will mean a stronger Royal Australian Navy.

Our Government is committed to maximising Australian industry content in the Future Submarine Program. This was a conscious decision of our Government. Beyond construction, the program will provide Australia with an independent, sovereign capability to sustain our fleet, including the upskilling of Navy and industry workforces. We will see long-term strategic cooperation, not only in defence industry as I know Minister Ciobo will be excited about, but across other sectors, creating even more jobs through more high-tech, high-paying jobs.

Hundreds of Australians are already employed on the Future Submarines Program and thousands more will be through the supply chain during the construction phase. So, as pleased as I know Premier Marshall is about the jobs in South Australia, these jobs reach right across our great continent.

The signing of this agreement today demonstrates our Government is delivering on our promise on the naval shipbuilding plan. It is a $90 billion commitment to build in total 54 new naval vessels and grow a strong, sustainable and sovereign Australian naval shipbuilding industry.

This is a very audacious plan. This is what vision looks like. The number of shipbuilding programs we are launching is beyond what just about any other country - including the United States - has done since the Second World War. The number of new starts on these projects is almost without parallel. This is a big project, this is an audacious program that we have set before us and we are committed to achieving it. 12 attack class submarines will be a cornerstone of that plan and it’s all part of Australia's biggest-ever peacetime investment in defence. The strategies were laid out in the 2016 Defence White Paper and we are getting on with the job. Over $200 billion is being invested in Australia's Navy, Army and Air Force defence capability over the next decade. With the signing of today's agreement, we are strengthening our region, something I know Minister Payne cares about deeply and is part of her ongoing discussions not only in the Indo-Pacific region, but all around the world. This is a key part of our participation in creating a safer and more peaceful world.

Our region, which we keep secure, in close partnership with our valued allies. So we are delivering for our Navy, our nation and our people as we promised. We are delivering for our defence industry and jobs and we are delivering on our steadfast commitment to keep Australians safe and secure.

I conclude by thanking again all of those who have brought us to this point today, but I particularly want to commend Ministers Pyne and Parly for the wonderful working relationship they've had to bring us to where they are today and look forward to that relationship continuing into the future as we get this done. Thank you.

PRIME MINISTER: Well, good morning. It’s great to be here with David Coleman, not only the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs but of course the Member for Banks and my neighbour as the Member for Cook. It’s wonderful to be here with David and to be part of the Lunar New Year celebrations which are going on all around the country. So xin nian kuai le to all of those and gong xi fa cai to everyone to continuing to engage in those celebrations from the Vietnamese, the Chinese and Korean communities. It’s a wonderful time of family and celebration and recognising the great contribution of particularly the Chinese community to Australia, and all of these communities, to Australia and the incredible, strong relationships that we have with China, with Korea and Vietnam. There is a major Vietnamese celebration on this evening where David will be representing me. So it’s wonderful to be here for that purpose, that’s why we’re in Penshurst.

But given we’re both together today I thought it was an important opportunity to make this very simple point to Bill Shorten; there is no form of this bill that is acceptable. This bill is not only a bill that will undermine – in any form – the Government’s successful border protection regime. It is also a completely unnecessary bill. Children, the last four with their bags packed to go to the United States, will be off Nauru. We have announced at the beginning of this week, a measure that does not require legislation, that provides the transparency and assurance to Australians about the medical services that are provided. There is no form of this bill that makes our border protection stronger or fairer. All it does is weaken that border protection. There is no middle ground to be sought here, there is only the right ground that we stand on, that we have stood on for decades. We’ve had to solve Labor’s problem of opening our borders, not once, but twice. And Labor are still enticed into this folly of seeking to undermine it. Already, they have said that they will abolish temporary protection visas, just like they did last time when the boats came.

They have already now put us in this position where Bill Shorten is still toying with the idea of passing legislation that would lead to the undermining of our successful border protection regime. He has finally accepted a briefing after five days. That briefing and the advice that the Government has received has been declassified and has been made available. What it says is pretty clear; if you go ahead with this, detention centres like the one at Christmas Island will have to be reopened. That will not only open our borders again but it will lead to a cost to tax payers of at least $1.4 billion, because those estimates don’t include the restarting of the boats, that’s just dealing with the 1,000 people that we would expect to make their way from the regional processing locations to Australia.

This bill is folly. This bill, however positively it might be motivated by some, it’s detail, it’s construction, can only unpick and undermine the strong border protection framework that we have worked hard to put in place and that has been successful.

If Bill breaks this, he owns it. If Bill breaks this, he has taken Australia into this position and it will be on his head in terms of what follows from this. We have always remained resolute in our position on border protection and we will remain exactly in that position.

I want to ask the Minister to make a few comments on that and then there’s one other matter I’d like to address before we take questions.

THE HON DAVE COLEMAN, MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS: Thanks PM. Our Government has been extremely successful in securing our borders, stopping the boats and getting people out of detention. There were 2,000 kids in detention when we came to office, we got them all out. As the Prime Minister said, all of the children on Nauru but for four that will shortly travel to the United States, have been removed from Nauru. You can only do that when you have secure borders and when those borders are managed by the Government. Now Bill Shorten’s law – and let’s be clear on this, this is Bill Shorten’s law, it’s not Kerryn Phelp’s law. There’s one Kerryn Phelps but 19 Labor senators who already voted for this law. This isn’t theoretical, Labor voted for this law already in December and if they’d had their way, it would have become the law of Australia in December. That just shows the political opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition and his wiliness to play politics with this most crucial of issues.

Now if Bill Shorten’s law comes into being, we anticipate within weeks, substantially all of the 1,000 people who are on Manus and Nauru will come to Australia. We expect that will overwhelm our existing systems in the management of arrivals from offshore processing centres and we expect that will mean the Christmas Island detention centre will need to be reopened. Now we’ve closed 19 detention centres that Labor opened. The reason we’ve been able to close them is because we’ve secured our borders and stopped the boats. The law that Labor voted for in December is extraordinary, it is incredibly badly thought-through. It will lead to the effective end of offshore processing as we know it. What that means is that people smugglers say; “There’s an opportunity,” and the boats start again. Incredibly, Bill Shorten’s law applies not only to the people that are on Manus and Nauru now, but also any future arrivals. So any future arrival who comes to Manus or Nauru simply needs to get two doctors in Australia to say that they should come to Australia for assessment and they will come. That is an extraordinarily low bar and it means that the integrity of offshore processing will be fatally undermined. As the PM said; there is no middle ground on this. We have a very strong record and this law would bring to an end offshore processing and would lead to a restarting of boat arrivals.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you David. Now, we’re talking about border protection and on Monday I’ll be talking a lot more about our plan for a safer and more secure Australia and those issues go beyond defence and border protection and terrorism and things of that nature. They also go to keeping Australians safe in their homes and they go to keeping Australian kids safe online. That’s why I’m pleased that today we are announcing $10 million to support a grants programme, to support not-for-profit organisations that are working in our communities to keep kids safe online. Also, working with the Alannah and Madeline Foundation to work up a concept, a proposal that can lead to the establishment of digital licenses. This is I think an important initiative. There’s a lot of work still to be done, but today – David and I are parents, in fact our kids go to the same schools – and there’s nothing that more terrifies parents, it certainly does me as a dad of two girls, about the safety of kids online. We all have these conversations with our kids and we all need to, but we also need to work as a community to keep our kids safe online. It is a dangerous place. It’s a place where they can learn many things, where they can connect with their friends and that’s all fine, it has many positive purposes and uses. But we also need to know that our kids are as safe being online as they are at the local playground or in their school. That’s why I’m pleased to announce that this is part of what I mean when I say I want to keep Australians safe. It’s not just from terrorism, it’s not just from the external threats and the bolstering of our Defence Force and our security agencies. It’s about keeping our kids safe, it’s about keeping women safe, it’s about ensuring the broader safety of all Australians in our community and in their homes.

But Minister Fifield will have more to say about that later today and I want to thank the Alannah and Madeline Foundation for their cooperation in working through this. But also, again pay tribute to our Australian Heroes of the Year who started Dolly’s Dream, it’s a great legacy they’ve established and we’re pleased to work with them in any way we can.

Happy to take questions.

JOURNALIST: Why is the Government assuming the cost over the next five years? Whether these people would have gone on to the US or other countries by then?

PRIME MINISTER: No, what we’ve done here is we have asked our agencies to tell us what we would have to do in the event this bill was passed. Their advice to us is that these detention centres would have to be reopened, because it would overwhelm our existing network. The cost of that over the Budget and forward estimates would be $1.4 billion and that’s a pretty conservative estimate. Because as I said, that doesn’t even take into account any restarting of arrivals which they also note is a likely outcome from this. So $1.4 billion is the opening gambit, it only gets worse from there. Remember when Labor lost control of the borders, it cost an additional $11.6 billion. That’s when Chris Bowen, the now shadow treasurer who wants to become the Treasurer, he couldn’t control the borders and it cost the Budget an additional $11.6 billion.

JOURNALIST: There are medical doctors saying this bill or some variation of this bill is necessary. Do you say - 

PRIME MINISTER: No, I absolutely reject that. I absolutely reject it, we have the medical processes in place and what the Minister and I announced on Monday, I think provides an appropriate assurance and transparency around that process. We cannot have Australia’s borders determined by panels of medical professionals. They have a role to play in the system and they play that role, but ultimately that decision must rest with the sovereign, elected Government. You cannot contract these decisions out, you can’t compromise on this.

I’ve seen this before. When Labor were floundering in Government last time, I was the shadow minister, I saw it, I lived it every day. All they tried to do was solve the politics in the media cycle every day and they refused to confront, head-on, the serious problem. We’re not doing that. I’m not looking for a compromise with Bill Shorten, he’s the one who has created this diabolical situation. He’s the one who can end it by simply saying; “We’re voting against the bill, that’s it, we made a mistake.” Let’s move on.

JOURNALIST: So you can categorically [inaudible] rule out any coming to the table –

PRIME MINISTER: There’s no table to come to. There’s no table to come to, this isn’t about a compromise. There’s no need for this bill, it is completely unnecessary and the ground we’re on is the right ground. We’d simply say, if you’re for border protection, you’ll stand with us on this ground, to the Leader of the Opposition. Why he’s decided to go where he has gone, only he can explain. He’s already demonstrated to date a very serious weakness and failing. He has been tempted by the opportunity of some sort of political humiliation of the Government in the Parliament. Well, I’ll cop that if it means protecting our borders. If that’s what Bill Shorten prizes, he can have it. He can have it, I’ll have the Government’s position on stronger borders any day of the week.

JOURNALIST: Were the costings done by a Government department?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

JOURNALIST:  By your office or a Minister’s office?

PRIME MINISTER: They were done by the Department of Finance. It was done as part of the process of Home Affairs advising the Government about what our response would have to be and those costings were done in the normal way by the Finance Department. It wasn’t about costing Opposition policies, this was about costing what the Government’s response would have to be in the event, as a contingency of this bill being passed. So they are official Finance costings.

JOURNALIST: How much would the Government save by winding back operations on Manus and Nauru?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, as you know Manus is closed. That centre has already closed and we maintain and will always maintain regional processing on Nauru because it is a key part of the border protection framework. I can tell you what it costs if we close it; at least $11.6 billion because that’s what it cost last time Labor lost control of the borders. You close regional processing and you shut it down at your peril. I remember having to argue until I was hoarse in Opposition; you must reopen offshore processing and Labor fought it and they fought and they fought it and they eventually relented in the dying days of their government. Yet here they are again. I mean how many elections do we have to have on this issue for the Labor Party to get it? We just want strong borders and to keep the policies that are working. Why is Bill Shorten playing around with this? It defies any sense and betrays a great weakness on his part.

JOURNALIST: Will you remove Tim Wilson as chair of the franking credits inquiry?

PRIME MINISTER: No of course not. I think Tim is giving a voice to retirees around the country and the Labor Party can’t stand it. They have treated these retirees with contempt and disrespect. They have said; “They don’t pay tax.” These are people who have paid tax all their lives, all their lives and it’s insulting and offensive what the Labor Party has been saying. I’m not surprised they’re furious and they’re turning up the hearing to voice that. Tim and his entire committee have given these Australians a voice and I think they should commended for that.

JOURNALIST: You’ve said this bill would mean murders and rapists will come to Australia.

PRIME MINISTER: I said it can allow it.

JOURNALIST: Are there murders and rapists in those detention centres?

PRIME MINISTER: This bill doesn’t just apply to those who are here now, it applies prospectively. What it fails to do is provide those protections, that’s just a simple legal fact. A simple legal fact and it makes the point that David has made and I think he’s put it rightly; this is Shorten’s bill. This is Shorten’s ‘ending offshore processing’ bill. That’s what this bill is, because if he votes against it, then it’s gone. If he votes for it, it’s likely to pass and what that bill does is it changes the border protection arrangement for the worse, not for the better. You can’t fix this bill, you can’t fix it. You can’t make it better, it’s an unnecessary bill. It’s time to bin it and for him to admit that this was not something they should have even entertained. That fact that they even entertained it I think has already given Australians sufficient  cause for concern about the real weakness that lies at the heart of Bill Shorten and the Labor Party.


PRIME MINISTER: Please forgive my husky voice at this early time in the morning and thank you all for joining us this morning which enabled me to be here. And to Bridget and to all our distinguished guests, particularly the athletes, their families and supporters who are here with us today and all the officials from the Paralympic movement.

This is a very special day. Some years ago - and Kurt and I discussed this - it was 10 years ago in fact, I walked the Kokoda Track. Now for me, it was tough. But it wasn’t courageous. What you do is courageous. There’s lots of people who play sport, there’s lots of people who give everything they have. There’s enormous stories of great feats of endurance and physical performance of our elite athletes. And sure it takes determination and persistence and commitment and dedication. That’s the starting line for you guys. When you achieve, it’s more than that. It’s a courage that goes beyond anything I have seen in sport. Anything that I have seen.

So when Kurt got himself across the Track - and he told me he’s not going to do it again in a hurry, by the way - that was courage. I was down at the Australian Open this year with Bridget and we saw amazing performances. Ash Barty, we were there on that day to see Ash hit herself into the final round, and we saw the great Roger Federer, emerging new talents coming through. But I got to have a hit with Dylan Alcott, and not only is he cheeky as, but he is a five-time Australian Open winner. Again, it’s the difference between being an elite athlete and being someone incredibly special.

The reason I am announcing two elements of funding today - there’s $12 million in total for Paralympians today - $8 million to support the team to Tokyo and your preparation. But $4 million also down in Melbourne to support the ongoing training facilities and engaging people in Paralympic sport in this country. The inspiration that you provide to Australians is something this country needs.

Australians are a very special group of people and I saw that first-hand yesterday when I was up in the floods in Townsville and down in the fires in Tasmania the day before. But what you do demonstrates that spirit every day you train, every day you set your mind to that goal. It doesn’t matter whether you’re playing bocce or you’re playing wheelchair rugby out of Port Macquarie or whatever you’re doing. You are every day doing it, saying to the rest of Australians, regardless of what their ability is, their background is, you can do it. You can do anything you set your mind to. And all Australians need that message. Not just those with disabilities who turn them into abilities, all Australians need that inspiration.

And that’s why as a Government we are so pleased - I mean, they had me at hello when they came to see me last year, they really did. I already got it, and so I want to thank you for what you’re doing. This is our investment in an investment you’re already making in our country and a contribution you’re already making through what you do. My parents always taught me life is about what you contribute, not what you accumulate, and you’re living that principle.

So I’m incredibly proud of what you’re doing. I can’t wait to see when you’re there in Tokyo. It isn’t just about the competition, as you know. At the Paralympics, everybody cheers for everybody. Because everybody is a champion. But I’m pretty sure we’re going to have some champions beyond that as well with a lot of medals around their necks which will be your reward, your own personal reward and your own acknowledgment of the wonderful things that you have been doing.

So $12 million dollars, it is a contribution we’re pleased to make it out of the Budget. We took the decision towards the end of last year and I’m just so pleased that I could be with you today. I wish you all the best for your preparations over the next few years, I wish the movement all the best as you continue to raise your profile and you get more and more recognition. Whether it’s from the broadcast networks or others, that they see what is the amazing story that is Paralympic sport here in this country. We’re a world leader athletically and I think more than that, in terms of how we run the show here, and I think we have things to teach the rest of the world. But in Tokyo, I’m looking forward to you teaching them a few things as well.


CHRIS CREWTHER MP: I’m Chris Crewther, the Federal Member for Dunkley. I’m here at the intersection of Greenwood Drive and Ballarto Road with the Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Minister Alan Tudge and the Mayor of Frankston City Council, Councillor Michael O’Reilly. I’m very pleased to be here today with the Prime Minister and the Minister to announce $30 million for intersection upgrades along Ballarto Road, including Greenwood Drive, Dion Drive, Potts Road and elsewhere. Since Carrum Downs, Skye and Sandhurst all came into my electorate, residents have raised with me on a continual basis how hard it is to get in and out of residential streets, particularly during peak hour times. Skye CFA have also raised the issue of just getting onto Ballarto Road to fight fires and that can be very difficult at peak times. So this will resolve intersections along the road, it will mean families can spend more time at home, it means safer roads and it means quicker response times for the Skye CFA along this road.

PRIME MINISTER: Thank you. Well thank you very much Chris and to Alan and to Michael, thank you for being here with us today. Can I first of all congratulate you Chris. I mean, we can’t go and make these congestion-busting investments unless we have the people on the ground who know what they’re talking about and are in touch with their local communities. So the way the congestion-busting fund works is that Alan as the Minister for congestion busting, works with the local members to identify what those key priorities are. It can be as frustrating trying to get onto these key corridors, as it can sometimes be being on them. The congestion-busting fund, whether it’s here in Victoria or up in south east Queensland where I was last week, are all about doing two important things; getting families together at night, ensuring that parents can get home more readily and more safely and they can spend time together as a family. Secondly, it’s about ensuring that people running small businesses, tradies and others - and those that we’ve just heard from, the Skye CFA who I just met with just before coming here - can get to where they need to get to quickly and safely as well, to do the job. If you’re a tradie, you don’t get paid for sitting in a traffic jam or trying to get onto a road, you get paid for being on site. What this congestion-busting fund is delivering is exactly that.

$30 million here for Ballarto Road to do the upgrades, but also $50 million for two projects. $50 million for the Calder Corridor which I’ll ask Alan to speak to, and the Hume Corridor. These other important parts of the road network here that will enable people to be able to get home sooner, get home safer, to where they need to be.

So Alan, thanks again for the great planning work you’ve done. You’re linking all of these great projects together and it’s a great way to ensure that this urban congestion fund iS delivering exactly what it was designed to do when I handed down the Budget in May. Thanks Alan.

THE HON ALAN TUDGE MP, MINISTER FOR CITIES, URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND POPULATION: Well thanks very much, Prime Minister and Chris. We’ve got $20 billion worth of infrastructure projects being delivered here in Victoria. That included $7.8 billion just at the last Budget. Most of that money is going towards the big corridors, the big rail, the big road projects, such as $5 billion for the airport rail. Half a million dollars to upgrade the Monash. $225 million to electrify the line from Frankston to Baxter, which Chris has so strongly supported and many other projects. This urban congestion fund project is actually aimed at those small pinch points where, as the Prime Minister says, sometimes you spend as much time getting held up in traffic in those pinch points as you do being held up in traffic on the major corridors such as the Monash Freeway.

Today we’re announcing four projects. We’ve heard a little bit about Ballarto Road from Chris, $30 million going in there. We’re also funding two $50 million projects. The Calder Freeway, which is already heavily congested, particularly on the inbound traffic and there, we’re going to be investing money in order to improve the capacity from Gap Road all the way down to the Ring Road which is the most congested area. We estimate, the forecasts are, for the traffic to increase by 3,000 cars per hour to about 4,000 cars per hour during peak hour. If we don’t do anything, the traffic will slow by almost half. So we’re investing there to improve the traffic flow.

Then on the Hume Freeway - and everyone knows the Hume Freeway, it’s a massive corridor between here and Sydney - it’s particularly congested in the last section before you hit the Ring Road. So, another $50 million investment there to increase the capacity of that and that will complement some of the other work which we already have going on with the State Government at the intersection of O’Hearns Road and the Hume Freeway. Then this afternoon we’ll be announcing smaller projects with Kevin Andrews and that’s just a small corridor there of $10 million.

Together, these projects will really make a practical difference to the lives of Melburnians. I’m born and bred Melbourne; I know the congestion of this city. We need to be investing and we are investing and what these local projects are about, is getting people home sooner and safer.

MICHAEL O’REILLY, MAYOR OF FRANKSTON: I’ll just be very brief. First of all I’ll just thank the Prime Minister, our local member Chris Crewther and Minister Tudge for coming out today. The one thing I get as Mayor of Frankston is complaints about the traffic congestion here in Carrum Downs. There are only a few exits onto Ballarto Road and as you can see, it’s the middle of the day and we have already traffic going up and down in an extremely busy state. When this gets to rush hour, people are sitting in their cars, coming out of the intersections, constantly. So this is an amazing thing for not only Frankston City but for the people of Carrum Downs. So I thank everyone for their contribution.

PRIME MINISTER: So we’re listening and we’re doing. It’s a big priority for our Government; congestion-busting in growing cities all around the country. Let’s take some questions on the announcement today and then I’m happy to address other issues as well.

JOURNALIST: The state government says; “Thanks for this and now can we have $3 billion for the East-West Link”. Are you going to hand that over?

PRIME MINISTER: Well that currently is part of a contingency which is in the Budget and is still there, there's a Budget in April this year.

JOURNALIST: Are you able to elaborate a little bit more on exactly what upgrades are going to take place here at Ballarto Road? Is it widening, is it adding some lanes, duplicating?

PRIME MINISTER: I’d be happy for Chris to answer, explaining the details of the project.

CHRIS CREWTHER MP: So in a number of different intersections along this road, we are looking to upgrade those intersections so people can get in and out of the residential streets easier. So for example, they include lights, they include lanes so that people can actually merge with the traffic instead of sitting perpendicular with the intersection and it may include other upgrades as well to reduce that congestion. At Potts Road for example it will include lights and then the option to press a buzzer so the CFA can actually control those lights and get out to fires when they need to do that. But importantly, there are many roads along here that intersect such as Greenwood, Dion Drive, Potts Road and other intersections. We are looking to upgrade as many of those intersections as possible so people can spend more time at home with their families.

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible] you’ve asked the Premier to match this funding but he says he found out about it when he read it in the newspaper. Is that correct?

PRIME MINISTER: We welcome their investment in the project and we’ll work closely together with the Victorian Government. We work closely with them on a whole range of projects and I’m looking forward to working with Premier Andrews and that’s why I sent him a note after his recent re-election saying just that.

JOURNALIST: Are you meeting with him during your time in Melbourne?

PRIME MINISTER: Not today, but we catch up. I saw him just the other day actually when I was down here for the Anniversary of the Black Saturday Fires.

JOURNALIST: But a face to face meeting?

PRIME MINISTER: I don’t have one planned today, no.

JOURNALIST: Just to clarify, so you expect in the Budget there will be some announcement around the $3 billion?

PRIME MINISTER: I just said the Budget is in April, that’s all I said. There’s currently a contingency, that provision sits in the Budget currently on this and we’ll be looking at that. That’s there for the East West Link. That’s what it’s there for.

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible]

PRIME MINISTER: It’s a contingent liability, it’s there in the event that it’s triggered by a state government wanting to do that project, then there is the contingent commitment that we’ve made and that’s how it sits on the books.

JOURNALIST: Hakeem al-Araibi and Thailand, have you managed to speak on the phone to your Thai counterpart?

PRIME MINISTER: I have written two letters now to the Thai Prime Minister and our consular officials and others have been using every opportunity they have, to press the case to bring Hakeem home. We’ve also been pressing that case with the Government of Bahrain as well.

I’d simply say this; it is within the executive authority of the Thai Government to actually enable him, under their law, to be returned to Australia. I have pointed this out in the engagements I have had with the Thai Prime Minister and what I have also stressed is that the Australian people and the Thai people have a wonderful people-to-people relationship. I have stressed just how strongly Australians feel about this and I would be very disappointed if as a result of how this matter has handled, that the relationship between us the Thai and Australian people were affected. I would be very disappointed about that. So I have appealed to the Prime Minister to take that into account. They do have the authority to use those executive controls for him to come home. So we’re going to continue to work patiently and respectfully to secure that outcome.

JOURNALIST: Labor is calling on Tim Wilson to resign over a conflict of interest. Do you think he has a conflict of interest?

PRIME MINISTER: So the Labor Party aren't content with arrogantly dismissing thousands upon thousands, hundreds of thousands of retirees around our country who they basically want to steal money from with higher taxes. Now they’re going to throw mud at the person who is giving those retirees a voice? Labor frankly have no shame when it comes to this issue. They don’t want to listen to retirees, they have arrogantly dismissed them and now they want to shut down people who are trying to give retirees a voice.

This is classic Labor, classic thuggish Labor, throwing mud wherever they can because they do not want to face up to the fact that they’re putting a $5 billion a year tax on the retirees. It’s egregious. These people have paid taxes all their lives and what does Chris Bowen and Bill Shorten say to them? They haven’t paid any tax. I mean seriously, how offensive is that? So look, they’ll throw mud, they’ll treat retirees with disrespect. But I tell you what; those retirees will be remembering Bill Shorten when they go into those ballot boxes.

JOURNALIST: So you won’t be sacking Tim Wilson?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

JOURNALIST: It’s $160,000 in taxpayers money, is it right to be politicising a parliamentary committee?

PRIME MINISTER: I think it is great that retirees all around the country have got a voice and they can bring forward their concerns in this forum. I mean, that’s what the Parliament is supposed to be about; giving Australians a voice. Bill Shorten wants to shut them down, arrogantly dismiss them and take their money. No wonder they’re upset.

JOURNALIST: On the Royal Commission Prime Minister, why would the Government continue grandfathering [inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I note that the Labor Party is yet to fully respond to the Royal Commission. The Government has provided a full response, we did that when we released the Royal Commission Report on Monday. The Labor Party is still using words like “in principle” and all the rest of it, so I don’t know what their response is at this time. I’ll wait to see what their full response is, when they get around to providing it.

But what I do know is that we are acting on all 76 recommendations and we’re going to do it carefully and we’re going to do it in a considered way. I’ve been a Treasurer and when you’re preparing legislation and making big changes in the financial system, you do it carefully, because otherwise, you can put the system at risk. So Bill Shorten might want to cobble together legislation and throw it around in the Parliament, that may have been how he ran things when he was the Financial Services Minister and did nothing about Storm Financial and all the other financial collapses. He didn’t call a Royal Commission, he didn’t do anything. So now, we will wait for him to give his response. But as a Government, we’ll be taking action on this for years, we will continue to take action and we’ll continue to take action on the 76 recommendations of the report.

JOURNALIST: On the Phelps bill, is it fair to say that any two doctors can sign off on an asylum seeker coming to Australia and the only way it can be rejected is if a Minister decides it’s on national security grounds?

PRIME MINISTER: What the Phelps inspired bill does is contract border protection away from the government to any two doctors. It can be any two doctors. No one has been pre-approved, it could be no one who has any sense or understanding of what the security issues are at risk. There is insufficient provisions in that bill to do any proper security assessments. But worse than that, it doesn’t provide for the usual arrangements which would enable us to reject someone coming to Australia because they have a criminal history. They may be a paedophile, they may be a rapist, they may be a murderer and this bill would mean that we would just have to take them.

So this is what will happen. If Bill Shorten does not put national security ahead of his own political opportunism, hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of single males - because there are no kids on Nauru as you know, I made that clear on Sunday, the last four are on their way to the United States - hundreds of them will have to be transferred to Australia at the directive of doctors, not the Government. This will mean we will have to reopen detention centres that we closed, like Christmas Island. We shut Christmas Island. This will cost a serious amount of money on the Australian taxpayer and it’ll undermine the successful border protection framework that has stopped the boats and ensured the integrity of our borders for the last five and a half years.

So I said to Bill Shorten last night; if you break it, you own it. And I would implore him to step back and put national interest and national security ahead of what is just flagrant political opportunism.

JOURNALIST: If you lose that vote, will that be a trigger for an election?

PRIME MINISTER: No, of course not. Why would it be?

JOURNALIST: Is it actually going to get to a vote in the next two weeks, the next two sitting weeks?

PRIME MINISTER: Well that’s how it’s scheduled, yeah.

JOURNALIST: Will you try and delay it?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

JOURNALIST: Has Cathy McGowan given you an assurance she won’t vote for the Kerryn Phelps bill?

PRIME MINISTER: Cathy is still considering her position, but let me be clear, this isn’t about Cathy McGowan. This is about Bill Shorten. This bill passes if Bill Shorten votes for it. So the border protection framework which has been so successful, which I was the architect of, if Bill Shorten wants to tear it down, he will instruct his party to vote for this bill coming back from the Senate.

So it’s on you, Bill. Here’s the test. Whichever way it goes, we will have passed the test, because we have stood up for having the right border protection framework in Australia. As for Bill Shorten, who knows what he believes?

JOURNALIST: On the banks, they had their best day on the share market in a long time yesterday. It is a sign that the Royal Commission was a bit soft on them?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I think what it showed was that Commissioner Hayne has done a very sound and responsible job. I think he has managed the issues in a very appropriate way. I think it’s a very well-considered report and it provides a lot of action for us to now follow through on, which we are doing. But equally, he has been able to do it in a way which has minimised disruptions to the financial system which has always been a key issue. We had seen as a result of the Commission a tightening in credit around the country which has had an economic impact which Australians full well know. That’s why we have to continue to manage this issue very carefully.

We will take the action that is necessary, we will do it in a responsible and measured way as the Treasurer has been indicating and illustrating. The financial system is in a safe pair of hands in terms of ensuring that it continues to perform the vital role it does in the Australian economy and the Labor Party will just frankly play politics with it. Remember, the financial system is where you get your mortgage, it’s where you get your loans, it’s how you finance your car, it’s how you run your business, it’s what your job depends on. So you don’t go around just playing around with this sort of thing. You’ve got to be very careful and considered in how you do these things and that’s exactly what the Government has done. My voice is starting to give way, so...

JOURNALIST: Are you sick a bit?

PRIME MINISTER: Oh well I’ve been up in Townsville, I’ve been down in Hobart, we’ve been travelling a lot and I’ve met thousands upon thousands of people, literally, wishing them all a happy Chinese New Year as well so you’re bound to pick up a bug here or there.

JOURNALIST: Huang Xiangmo, do you think he’ll ever be allowed back into Australia?

PRIME MINISTER: Well look, you wouldn’t expect me to comment on those issues. They’re sensitive matters. The Government has always acted consistent with the advice that we receive and that’s what has happened on this occasion.

JOURNALIST: With the money he has donated to the major parties, should it be returned?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, from the first of January this year, the bill that we put to the Parliament to outlaw foreign donations - so the Liberal Party and the National Party, that was our initiative - that came into effect on the first of January this year and we’re fully compliant with it.

We’ve introduced the law to ban foreign donations. That’s what we did, that’s the action we took. In relation to past donations, well the actions we’ve been taking in relation to this gentleman, that’s based on information that exists today. I’m not in a position to say what the position was several years ago. So where these things have happened in good faith - and we know that donations have been made to many political parties, not just one - then we have prospective laws that deal with that into the future and I think that’s the responsible way to deal with it.

JOURNALIST: Just on climate change, the Climate Council has released a report today talking about Australia’s extreme weather. What are you doing about climate change?

PRIME MINISTER: We’re going to reduce emissions by 26-28 per cent by 2030 through our Emissions Reductions Fund and the many other measures that we have. We’re meeting our targets, that’s what we’re doing. We’ve set our targets, we’re meeting them. We hit Kyoto 1, we’re going to smash Kyoto 2 and we’ll meet 2030 in a canter with the measures we’ll have in place to achieve that.

So I think Australians expect their Government to take action on climate change and we are, but what we won’t do it this; we won’t put a 45 per cent target on the Australian economy that will shut down industries, that will shut down jobs. That’s what the Labor Party wants to do. It’s bad enough that they want to put $200 billion of higher taxes on Australians all around the country. A deadweight on the Australian economy, as we go into some difficult times. They want to make matters worse with a reckless target that will shut down jobs all across Australia. We won’t be doing that, we have a responsible target and we have the programs to meet them. Thanks very much.TRANSCRIPT - JONES & CO

ALAN JONES: Thank you for your time.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks Alan.

JONES: Just a quick one on Townsville, I know you have been there.

PRIME MINISTER: I have. Look, all the best of Australia is on display in Townsville, as you’d expect it to be. Last night, when I arrived there it was still raining, but it’s subsided and the water level dropped quite a lot today. And so families are now facing the hard task of walking back into homes with mud all the way through. I met with quite a lot of them today, young kids, and you know the bedroom, the carpet and everything. So that’s going to be the tough part of this week as they go back. But I’ve got to tell you, the Third Brigade are heroes. The emergency service workers, the Red Cross, all of them, the evacuation centres. I walked down one street, at one end of the street they had been inundated, at the other end it had just lapped on where the sandbags were and everyone down that end of the street were down helping people at the other.

JONES: Can I just tell you what they’re saying though on struggle street. They’re not harsh, we’re not harsh about foreign aid, our foreign aid bill is $4.2 billion. We give $1.3 billion to the Pacific, they say that’s important, the Pacific are part of our family. But there is another $3 billion, they say to me, “Why doesn’t the Prime Minister ring these countries and say, “listen I’ve got to look after my own people first, I’m going to have to allocate all of that $3 billion up here.” Now I know you’ve said $1,000 for adults and $400 for kids. You’re a father, you know how far $1,000 and $400 go, it doesn’t go anywhere.

PRIME MINISTER: It goes much more than that. I mean, there is a 13 week disaster allowance payment for those whose incomes are disrupted…

JONES: But are you going to throw any money in there to restore and rehabilitate these people?

PRIME MINISTER: Of course we are, and that’s exactly why I was up there today and that’s the next phase of the recovery. We went to Category C today in terms of the assistance that’s provided.

JONES: They’ve lost businesses.

PRIME MINISTER: I know, and that’s what this support does. It provides concessional loans for businesses to get through, it provides that additional support. So 13 weeks of allowances. So that’s about $12,000.

JONES: How would you like to get a concessional loan though, you can’t pay it back.

PRIME MINISTER: We’re going to be spending tens of millions of dollars in Townsville just on the income support payments and the emergency payments alone. That’s before we get into the infrastructure side of things on the other side of this. So there will be no shortage of assistance, there will be no shortage of cash support and other support that is needed for Townsville to rebuild, just as it is down in Huonville. I mean, one of the things in Tasmania - I was there the previous day – while large tracks of Tasmania have been incinerated, things like the Walls of Jerusalem, Cradle Mountain are unaffected. The best thing Australians can do to support the Tasmanians with the bushfires is have a holiday in Tasmania.

JONES: Absolutely true. Look, this has come back this Kerryn Phelps bill. I think, and we both think, that this is just diabolical.

PRIME MINISTER: So do I.

JONES: I was under the impression… Pardon?

PRIME MINISTER: So do I, it is diabolical.

JONES: You have written though Mr Shorten…

PRIME MINISTER: I have.

JONES: I was under the impression that you would be voting against the bill.

PRIME MINISTER: We are.

JONES: You’re going to vote against the bull?

PRIME MINISTER: Of course.

JONES: But there is an argument that that would create a constitutional crisis and you’d be frightened of going to an election.

PRIME MINISTER: That’s rubbish.

JONES: Well where does this business come from about you proposing a so-called ‘medical transfer clinical assurance panel’ to quote, “Provide clinical assurance on decisions about medical evacuations.” In other words, you’re not going to outsource it to two doctors but you’re going to actually agree with the Phelps proposal.

PRIME MINISTER: No no, that’s not what it is at all Alan. What it is is this: the way it works currently is clinicians decide whether someone should be transferred, OK? That’s not going to change. There’s clinicians who work within the Department of Home Affairs and they make the decisions about who moves and who doesn’t and that’s overseen by the Department of Home Affairs. All that I have done is made sure that the Australian people have got an assurance about how well that process works. They can’t change the decisions, they can’t reverse the decisions, the decisions all remain with the Department of Home Affairs and that does two things. One, it gives Australians confidence - as they should have – in the medical care that is being provided and it keeps the decision with the Government. I won’t be compromising on this Bill. If the Labor Party want to support this Bill and abolish offshore processing as they know it, it’ll be on their head. And if we lose that vote next week, so be it. We won’t be going off to the polls. The election is in May. I will simply ignore it and we’ll get on with business. But I’m not going to be howled down by the Labor Party who want to dismantle a border protection system I had a key hand in building.

JONES: The Kerryn Phelps… just one thing, can I sum up. The Kerryn Phelps Bill as I see it simply, in language that struggle street understands, is outsourcing immigration policy to two doctors.

PRIME MINISTER: And it is worse than that. Let me take you through it. Yes, it is that. You just need two doctors on Skype who say, “Well I can’t really see from here so you need to be brought to Australia so I can see you here.” That’s it. 400 people will come, single males from Manus Island, Nauru, within weeks, which will overwhelm our detention system. We’ve closed 19 detention centres. We’ll have to re-open Christmas Island. We’ll have to re-open detention centres that we were able to close because of our strong border protection policies. But it gets worse. In those circumstances they say, “Oh, but if there is a negative security assessment.” They give them a very short period of time. Now some of these people will never have even gone through that process, and as Peta will recall, security assessments particularly for those who have no papers are very difficult to determine.

But there is more, when it comes to character issues on our Migration Act, we can reject people. Now, there is nothing to stop in that case someone who is a paedophile, a rapist, who has committed murder, any of these other crimes, can just be moved on the say so of a couple of doctors on Skype. This is a stupid Bill, it is written by people who haven’t got the faintest idea how this works. We do and I am so appalled that the Labor Party would even play this sort of political game to get a cheap vote in the House next week. If that’s what he wants, if Bill Shorten is going to sell out our border protection to get a cheap, opportunistic win in the Parliament next week, well he can have it. I will stay on the side of strong border protection and he can take a running jump.

PETA CREDLIN: Well PM, he has already supported it. Labor have supported it in the Upper House.

PRIME MINISTER: They’ve already voted for it.

CREDLIN: Absolutely. So it’s through one Chamber of Parliament. I don’t see any indication publicly from the Opposition Leader that he’s going to back down. You’ve written to him, I’ve read a copy of the letter. Four pages of detailed argument why this is a very, very stupid move for border protection, for national sovereignty, for all the things that the Government has fought to turn around in the last six years. Have you heard from Bill Shorten, is he prepared to reconsider this?

PRIME MINISTER: No he hasn’t responded to me as yet. We will see. He is writing more letters at the moment on other topics. It is a big question of character, though.

JONES: But just summing up simply, because you’ve got to get this message through simply. Doesn’t even such a minor change, isn’t that really an incentive to people smugglers to start up?

PRIME MINISTER: Oh there’s no doubt. It is exactly as you said with the fishing boat captain from Indonesia. But Labor, don’t forget, their promising not temporary visas in Australia. They’re promising permanent visas in Australia. The first thing that happened in August 2008, when the boats started coming, we remember, Labor abolished temporary protection visas that were put in by the Howard Government. That’s when the boats started. Labor’s policy at this election is to abolish temporary protection visas again. That means anyone who illegally entered Australia can be given a permanent visa, which means citizenship. Now we stopped it.

CREDLIN: So you’re not scared of the fight next week?

PRIME MINISTER: Not at all Peta.

CREDLIN: One of the messages that kept coming out in the last few days is that you’re looking to find a back door way to avoid the Phelps vote. But if it goes to a vote, you’re prepared to stand and fight on principle?

PRIME MINISTER: We’ll vote it down.

CREDLIN: That will harden your support?

PRIME MINISTER: If that means that the vote goes down, it will be on Bill Shorten’s head. Now, Bill Shorten wants me to blame the crossbenchers for this. No no, Bill, it’s all on your head. You vote against it. You break it, you own it.

JONES: Good on you. Just on letters, to get away from all of this, you actually have written to the Prime Minister of Thailand about that soccer player Hakeem which I find a disgraceful episode, he’s gone there. Bahrain is seeking extradition, Interpol apparently, someone has dobbed this fellow in. You have written to the Prime Minister of Thailand about 10 days ago, has he responded?

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah he has, we got a response the other night. I have also written to him again, that letter crossed over on my second because I was very disturbed at the appearance of Hakeem at the hearing the other day. He was shackled and I thought that was, I thought that was very upsetting and I know it would have upset many Australians and I’m respectfully reminding the Thai Prime Minister that Australians feel very strongly about this. Very, very strongly.

JONES: We helped rescue people from a cave, didn’t we?

PRIME MINISTER: This is true and they were our Australians of the Year, in fact. And so we will continue to make these representations, not just to Thailand but also to Bahrain as well, and we are. Our officials are doing a very good job.

JONES: The bloke’s in jail.

PRIME MINISTER: Well we’re in a process there but as I said on the road the other day, it’s not my job to get upset, it’s my job to get him home.

JONES: Just let me allude to a speech you made last week, you said it’s important to remind all of us that our economy cannot be taken for granted. That the economy is real, its impacts are real, and most importantly it’s about people. Now that’s all terrific but in 2007 Kevin 07, the people in the public, the voters, the people you are talking to now didn’t seem to understand that it was real, what Howard and Costello had achieved. It would be safe with Labor. Threw them out, we’ve now seen what’s happened subsequently. How are you going to prosecute this case when Chris Bowen is talking about $20 billion of taxes…

PRIME MINISTER: $200 billion. Or as you said the other day, $20 thousand million.

JONES: That’s right, $20 thousand million, I’m telling you to say it and I’ve got it mixed up myself. $20 thousand million worth of taxes.

PRIME MINISTER: That’s true and the most pernicious is this retiree tax. $5 billion a year stolen from the lives of retired Australians but also small business owners and others who are affected. Tim Wilson and the House Committee have been holding these hearings around the country. When I was up in Queensland they were holding them. The stories, just one after the other, and Labor’s response is to arrogantly dismiss them and now start flinging dirt at anyone who accuses them on this. This retiree tax isn’t reform, there’s no reform. It is just a naked tax grab. You know, the reason people put up taxes – if you can’t control how much you tax, you can’t control how much you spend. This is the way we’ve got the Budget back into surplus, which we will have for the first time in 12 years on the 2nd of April this year. You control your taxes, you control your spending, your economy grows and we all move forward. It’s taken us 12 years to get back from Labor last time.

JONES: Let me take you to a point that Chris Bowen has made which, if I might say to you, critically I don’t think your Government has addressed. I’ve never heard a more nonsense observation, he said, “Why are we the only country in the world who would let people claim an income tax refund when they paid no income tax in this year? It’s generous but it’s not sustainable.” Can I suggest to you that there are plenty of examples of refunds being paid to people and businesses who paid no tax. Half the population pay no net tax.

PRIME MINISTER: Well this is right. In cases when you take in all the benefits and so on, you can have cases of people earning up to 80,000 a year and they pay no net tax. You still have thankfully a majority of people who do but that said, we’re close to a tipping point and I think that’s very concerning. And look, Chris just doesn’t seem to understand how the tax system works. I mean, the way company tax works is basically a withholding tax and you end up paying it on what your own personal tax rate is. Now, there is a reason why retirees have a zero tax rate. It’s because they’re in the retirement phase and they’ve paid taxes all their life. The most offensive thing Labor says about the retiree tax is they haven’t paid any tax. Give me a break, they’ve been paying tax all their lives.

JONES: Good on you.

PRIME MINISTER: And in comes the big dark hand of Labor to rip it out of your pockets.

JONES: Well done.

PRIME MINISTER: We’re fighting this every day and Australians are waking up to it. And it’s not just the retirees.

JONES: It’s a good argument, that. They’ve paid tax all their life, that answers that argument. There are a lot of people who pay no tax and get a refund at the end of the year. Thems are the rules. Every Labor leader up until now has agreed with the current system about franking credits.

PRIME MINISTER: They have. It was bipartisan policy and the reason they’re doing it is because they don’t know how to control their spending.

JONES: And Kim Beazley argued, and Simon Crean who was the leader said, “We must do this because it’s fair.”

CREDLIN: And look, they’re angry because in the 2016 Budget the Liberal Party hit them with superannuation changes when Tony Abbott and you were elected under the same banner in 2013 said there wouldn’t be. I’m going to ask you a question, put you in the hot seat, will there be any changes if you’re elected next term on superannuation or do you rule them out?

PRIME MINISTER: I rule them out.

CREDLIN: No further changes?

PRIME MINISTER: No, none. I think last time I was on the program I said the same thing.

JONES: Can we just take this negative gearing thing, just very very simple. I mean, there is a bit of a housing crisis at the moment. Negative gearing is related to tax, so people say well I’ve got a choice to where I’m going to put my $600,000, I’ll put it in an investment property and I’ll get certain tax benefits. But by putting it in an investment property, I actually am going to rent it so there is a greater pool of rental properties and accommodation.

PRIME MINISTER: 30 per cent of the housing market is rental accommodation as a result of mum and dad investors.

JONES: So if suddenly that incentive doesn’t exist, I’ll take my $600,000 and I’ll put it into BHP shares. Therefore, there is less rental accommodation. Rent goes up but there’s fewer people bidding on Peta’s house when she goes to sell it. So Peta’s house is worth less. Now here we are attacking a house owner and a renter, how the hell can you win an election?

PRIME MINISTER: This is exactly as it is. This is how I describe their policy. You buy a house now, it’s like buying a car. The minute you drive the car off the lot, the value goes down because you’re selling it to a smaller market. It is exactly the same now under Labor’s policy for buying a house and it affects everybody’s house. 

JONES: Can I just be a bit critical of you here if I might. Do you think you’re fighting on too many front? I think with an election coming, there are certain issues here which really dramatically… I mean, I’m not really worried about tariffs on kavas or whatever you were talking about in Fiji.

PRIME MINISTER: That was a very specific issue for them.

JONES: Right, these are powerful points. See, if you take the Capital Gains Tax. Now again, it’s a simple issue, isn’t it. I mean, you don’t buy anything, an asset, for the sake of it and make a loss. You hope you’ll make a quid.

PRIME MINISTER: That’s right.

JONES: There’s nothing wrong with making a quid. They’re going to increase the tax on the Capital Gain by 50 per cent.

PRIME MINISTER: 50 per cent on everything, not just on… it’s on shops, small businesses. See, you were talking about negative gearing before. Capital Gains Tax works the same way. Small businesses will go and invest in a rental property or in their own shops and things like this and this is what hits them. And it’s not just them - one in five of them are police officers. Peta knows, my dad was a police officer. One in five police officers negative gear. One in five. Labor likes to make out that they’re all, you know, dentists from well to do suburbs who own eight properties. That’s rubbish.

CREDLIN: No, it’s ordinary people.

PRIME MINISTER: The vast majority of people… you know, there are more people who negative gear properties in the federal electorate of Capricornia based on Rockhampton than in my southern seat of Cook in Sydney. Because people up there have worked in the mining industry, in the construction industry, and they’re creating opportunities for themselves. Labor hates it when people want to do better. They basically just want to keep everybody where they are, dependent on the Government.

JONES: We’re going to go, you’ve got to go somewhere else. You’ve been everywhere today. Just one final question, how could anybody vote for a Government that is talking about a 50 per cent renewable energy target or do you think the public are wedded to the view that this is the answer to our energy future? Don’t people understand what happened in South Australia, what’s just happened in Victoria? 200,000 homes reliant. Hazelwood is closed, 25 per cent of the power is gone. Liddell is likely to close here. Yet everyday - you are a Sydney man – the power that drives the toaster and the hot water in your kitchen, 92 per cent of that power is generated by coal-fired power. They are talking about renewable energy, how do you prosecute that case?

PRIME MINISTER: Well it’s pretty simple. A 45 per cent emissions reduction target wipes out Australian industries. I mean, the Boyne Island Smelter up there in Gladstone is gone. That’s 1,000 jobs. It’s gone. They can’t exist under Labor’s 45 per cent emissions reductions target. Australians want us to take sensible and practical and achievable action when it comes to our environment. But they do not want to sell our economy. They don’t.

CREDLIN: …investing in new, coal-fired power station this side of an election? Do we think anyone is going to get into the market?

PRIME MINISTER: Well you couldn’t build one of this side of the election.

CREDLIN: No, I’m not suggesting that at all PM. But people have been talking underwater. The Finkel Report says HELE is the way to go, it’s the most available, it’s cheaper.

PRIME MINISTER: Well they’ve got to make it stack up, as you know. I mean, the new ones…

JONES: You could build a dam.

PRIME MINISTER: Well we’re putting money into dams as you know, and there’s quite a number, we’re doing one up in North Queensland in Hughenden, that’s one we’ve been moving on over the last few months.

CREDLIN: But coal today, in the ABS stats, is our number one export. It’s propping up everyone’s budgets right around the country, yet we’re treating it like it’s a demon property here in Australia, likes it’s kryptonite. Do you think we’ll see a coal-fired power station?

PRIME MINISTER: I believe we’ll see, whether it’s that or that extended life of existing stations done on a commercial basis, but it all has to be done on a commercial basis.

JONES: But can you look down the camera here before you go and just say, as the Prime Minister of Australia, you want to tell all Australians there is no future other than a future in the dark if we don’t understand the importance of coal-fired power to the economic and personal well-being of Australians.

PRIME MINISTER: Well I will say, I don’t care where the power comes from, so long as it’s reliable and it turns up every day…

JONES: And affordable.

PRIME MINISTER: And of course affordable. And it is going to, that is going to be a big part of the mix for a very long time to come.

JONES: Coal, you mean.

PRIME MINISTER: Now that is true, as is gas, as is hydro.

JONES: There’s the camera, what do you say to the Australian people? Coal is going to be a part of mix.

PRIME MINISTER: I’d really like them to get the gas out from under the ground, Alan, they’ve locked it up here in New South Wales and in Victoria for too long and you know what that’s done to electricity prices? That.

JONES: Coal-fired power. Listen, good to talk to you.

PRIME MINISTER: You too.

JONES: Thank you for what you’re doing and we’ll talk again, we hope.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah and congratulations to Johnny Morris too, I think he’s going to do a great job down with those Sharks, what do you reckon?

JONES: Hmm, well this is Cronulla of course, the Prime Minister is a Cronulla supporter. I think what the Rugby League has done to Shane Flanagan is a disgrace.

PRIME MINISTER: Well you know my view on that, you and I are both big fans of Shane and he has got a wonderful family and he has been a great son of the Shire down there.

JONES: A good man.

PRIME MINISTER: He is a good man.

JONES: He made the mistake of speaking to his players when they were really facing personal crisis. If that’s a mistake, I’m on Shane Flanagan’s side.

PRIME MINISTER: Well we’ve both always been on that side, for a long time.

JONES: Go and get the cap on, we’ll see you next time.

THE HON WILL HODGMAN MP, PREMIER OF TASMANIA: I will just very briefly take the opportunity to welcome the Prime Minister and to also welcome back Senator Linda Reynolds to the Huon. There are a number of my parliamentary colleagues who are here today and a lot of community leaders who are wanting to come together and show a community that is under strain and under stress, that the government understands that and we’re coming together to provide support, assistance to show that we are listening and that we care about what’s happening in this community. We’ll do all we can to assist them through what could of course be something that impacts this community for a number of weeks yet. From the very start I’ve been in close contact with the Prime Minister and my federal colleagues to ensure that we’re working in sync and that our efforts are well-targeted so that the Commonwealth is fully aware of the situation on the ground here, particularly in the Huon and to also make sure that state resources are being well-applied to fight the fires and assist local government as well, in their efforts in the recovery process which is now already underway and which will go on for some time yet.

Our focus has always been about providing that support to these communities, not only to show we care, but to take actions that supports people through these difficult times. To protect people and property, to support our hard-working members of the fire service including our volunteer force, to welcome those who have come here in a truly national effort from every state and territory. We thank them and also the local government authority here under Mayor Bec Embers, who continues to do a great job.

Our focus and what we’ve spent our time on, is ensuring we’re working together, collaborating and to show that we are supportive of this community in it’s time of need. That’s why it’s fantastic to have the Prime Minister here today at short notice, a true demonstration that the Federal Government is very much similarly very keen to understand what’s happening here on the ground and also what we can do to support. Prime Minister?

PRIME MINISTER: Well thank you. First of all, can I thank you all for the opportunity to be here with you today and Assistant Minister Reynolds. Linda has been on the ground here for a couple of days now and as Will said,  we've been keeping in close contact now for some time about what have been ferocious fires right across Tasmania as it's incinerated wilderness areas.

But I must admit that having received the briefing this morning, I want to tell Australians that here in Tasmania, they’ve done an extraordinary job in trying to mitigate and limit the impact of these fires. Not just when it comes to property and of course, most importantly, lives; and it is one of the points that is worth acknowledging, that despite the ferocity of these fires, that that property damage has been limited in relative terms. But also, we've had no lives lost. That is something that I think we can note today and be very appreciative of.

But there has also been a lot of work to try and protect the natural heritage here as well. Places like the Walls of Jerusalem, Cradle Mountain, all of these are unaffected by these fires. I want Australians to know that, please come to Tasmania again soon. Please come soon. This state will be looking to support - whether it's here in the Huon or elsewhere - communities around the state that have been affected by these fires and the way all Australians can help Tasmanians and those affected here is by coming and visiting and experiencing one of the great natural wonders of the world.

The people are just as friendly, if not more. The coffee is still just as good. The salmon is better than ever. All of this is fantastic. Tasmania is a wonderful place to come and visit. It's important that we get that message out about Tasmania and that we would encourage people to come and visit and stick with their plans to come and have a great time here in this wonderful state.

Of course while the Premier and I and Linda and my other ministers, will be working closely together with the State Government to ensure the rehabilitation and the recovery from these fires, both from a tourism business point of view and more broadly, we're enlisting, I suppose, Australians in that venture as well. We'll be looking forward to working closely with the Hodgeman Government as Tasmania, Huon and other parts of the state rebuild. And they will, they will.

Today marks 10 years since the Black Saturday fires in Victoria. Tonight there will be a memorial and commemoration of that event in Melbourne. It's a reminder that of the devastation of those times, did come a rebuilding, did come a recovery. As I've moved around the Recovery Centre here and I’ve spoken to people and down in the town, spoking to the chopper pilots, the firies and people from parks, what I hear back is the sense of the resilience and community that always comes to the fore in times like this.

I’ve got to say, we'll be seeing exactly the same thing up in Townsville and the surrounds at the moment. While Tasmania is gripped by fire presently, in Townsville, it's floods. And just as all Australians' hearts have gone out to people here in Tasmania, the same is very much with the people of Townsville and the surrounding districts up there in the floods at the moment where they're facing, as we speak, the biggest of challenges. So that's why today, in the same way that Linda announced here yesterday for the affected areas here in Tasmania, we've announced the emergency assistance arrangements for Townsville today, that's been announced up there.

It is always a pleasure to see Australia at its best. Here in the Huon, we're seeing Australia at its best. I want to commend everyone for the volunteer effort they've put in, those who've opened up their homes. Those who have volunteered, to support those who are out fighting the fires. I particularly thank those firefighters who've come from interstate as well, not just the volunteers here who've been turning up, those who've come from across the ditch, the specialist firefighters who've come across from New Zealand. We've had around 1,500 firefighters rotate through this fire and there will be more to come in the weeks ahead. It’s not over yet. That's a tremendous coordinated effort and I saw that in Hobart this morning when I had my briefing on how that is all coming together. They have a good handle on what the risks are. They’ve got a great plan for dealing with it Will and I think it’s a real tribute to the leadership of the Fire Service here as to how they’re staying on top of it and seeking to manage the impacts as best they can. So look, I’m happy to take some questions on those issues broadly, one last thing. I want to thank the business owners who are supporting the volunteers who are here. I want to ask them to continue to provide that support. There are people here whose kids are going back to school and they’ll feel the need obviously and will have need to go back to work. I want to thank the employers who are allowing their firefighters to come and volunteer here and be here. Those firefighters are serviing, you’re service too, by allowing them to be here. I want to thank the business community and other employers who are out there, lending that support by making them available.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister Greens Senator Nick McKim says the fires have been made worse by your love of coal and you should be on your knees apologising to residents. Will you be doing that today?

PRIME MINISTER: I find that a pretty offensive suggestion and he might want to focus on just caring for the community, than making cheap shots.

JOURNALIST: Why has it taken two weeks to get here?

PRIME MINISTER: I’ve been keeping closely updated with what’s occurring here and I’m very pleased to be here today.

JOURNALIST: How much money is the federal Government willing to contribute to Tasmania’s firefighting effort?

PRIME MINISTER: We have a standing arrangement in terms of what is done in terms of in situations like this. We’re following those and Linda you might want to comment on how those arrangements are working. But look, I see this in all these types of events; the states and territories work very closely together with the Commonwealth and there are standing arrangements that kick in.

JOURNALIST: But is there a figure?

PRIME MINISTER: I’ll let Linda make a comment on that.

SENATOR THE HON LINDA REYNOLDS CSC, ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS: Thank you Prime Minister. As I mentioned to you yesterday, there is no cap, but there are a number of programmes that we’ve enacted in consultation with the Tasmanian Government. So initially the support we’re providing is that needed immediately by the Tasmanian authorities to fight fires and also for the evacuees and other people in the community who need that emergency relief and shelter. So as I announced yesterday with the Premier the Disaster Recovery Allowance has been activated and so people who have had the income affected because they can’t get to work, their sole business for example – we talked to Fiona today who’s café down at Geeveston which I recommend everybody go and visit – so we’re providing that sort of support. It is uncapped, it is by need. As we move forward over the months and years probably to come, given the scale of this disaster, I’ll be working still with the Premier, with Michael Ferguson, your state Minister and the Commonwealth will be providing all the required resources to go through the recovery and reconstruction phase. So there is no cap, it’s as needed and as per our agreement.

PRIME MINISTER: I just want to make a point on top of that; there are other supports. There’s the Building Better Regions Fund which actually can support tourism businesses and that fund is available. I mean the aerial assets that you’re seeing in place, the communications arrangements, these are all joint-funded initiatives that are pout together as part of the standing arrangements to deal with disasters right across Australia. So, these things kick in. So how much? As much as is needed, as much as is asked for under those arrangements and the Commonwealth will just continue to meet all of our responsibilities here enthusiastically, leaning forward into it, working in close partnership.

JOURNALIST: Do you have any idea about how many people may be affected and need that funding?

PRIME MINISTER: Not at this stage and the funding is there to support the demand. It’s a demand-driven programme, so as many as need it will be given it.

JOURNALIST: What are you doing to ensure Tasmania’s wilderness World Heritage areas are being protected in these fires?

PRIME MINISTER: Will might want to comment on that as well, but one of the impressive things I’ve seen here is the way the Parks Services here have been taking those precautionary steps. Linda was just reminding me this morning of some of the work they’ve been doing in terms of the sprinkler system that were put as defensive lines against some of the more sensitive parts of the wilderness assets that are here. So I think it’s a very forward looking, innovative, technology-driven approach and these are responsibilities that sit primarily obviously, with state governments but we’re always keen to support these things where we think we can lend a role. But I’ve got to say Tasmania is right on top of it Will.

PREMIER OF TASMANIA: Yeah and look, I’d just make some observations about what we’ve been doing to prevent bushfires, wildfires, as best we can across a very expansive natural estate. As reticent as I am to, myself, engage in any political arguments, it has been the Greens and environmentalists who in the past have been critical of us undertaking fuel reduction burns. We’ve put about $55 million in and considerably increased our effort to reduce fuel loads across the state for times such as this. It’s been attributed to preventing a broader-scale fire activity on the west coast fires that are currently underway. So we’ve been taking preventative action to reduce fuel loads and to ensure that those communities most at risk – and they’re right across the state – have less of the fuel-load threat to them.

ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS: Can I just add to that. In the briefings that I’ve had over the last couple of days, I’ve been extraordinarily impressed with the Parks and Wildlife Services’ approach. You’re doing things here in Tasmania that I don’t think any other state or territory is doing. As the Prime Minister has said, it’s the sprinklers in the areas of most natural importance and heritage significance. But it’s also, I saw yesterday firsthand that you’re actually making sure you know where all the raptor nests are, you know where all the beehives are and so it’s not just the trees, but it’s also that they’re doing an extraordinary job making sure that after lives and property, that your natural heritage and those businesses were protected. So it’s certainly something that I’m going to take back to the Ministerial Council and also highlight to other states and territories. Because they’ve done an extraordinary job.

JOURNALIST: Just on other matters [inaudible]? 

PRIME MINISTER: Before we go to other matters, I might make a comment about some other matters and then I’m happy to take some questions on those things. But are there any other questions on issues relating to - ?

JOURNALIST: [Inaudible]?

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah, please. I’m very happy to, this is why I’m here.

JOURNALIST: Would you consider calling in international resources to help with water bombing in remote alpine areas, either Premier or Prime Minister?

PRIME MINISTER: Well these arrangements are already being met by the aerial assets programmes we already have in place. We already have around - what was it – I think around 25 kiwis who are here who are part of a specialist firefighting unit. I mean they’re literally like firefighting commandos. They get dropped in to these quite remote areas and they have highly specialised skills. There are Australian firefighters who also have those skills and they’re working together in what is quite an elite team and the coordination of that is, I think, quite impressive. So that need is already being met.

ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS: Just on that, the Federal Government has committed an extra $11 million this year to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre and it’s done an extraordinary job. So there will be a lot of lessons learned for us nationally again out of this programme.  So as the Prime Minister was briefed this morning, Tasmania has seven aerial assets based here on the east coast mostly, in Tasmania. That has been seamlessly supplemented by up to another 30 aerial assets, everything from additional helicopters to fixed wing aircraft, to the very large bombing assets. I think this is going to be one of the as yet untold, great stories to come out of these protracted fires.

PRIME MINISTER: Most pilots who have come – we were chatting with the pilots – there was one here from Brisbane, there was one here from Canada too – so he’s a boot.

ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS: Yes, so they’ve done an extraordinary job. The very large tankers have been flying in on rotation from Avalon Airfield in Melbourne, so have a talk to them, they’re fantastic. 

PRIME MINISTER: The need is being met with our standing arrangements. Anything else on those matters? I particularly want to say that Senator Abetz and Senator Colbeck are here with us as well today and I want to thank you guys for the work you’ve been doing. This is your home as it is Will’s and I’m told he’s run around this park a few times maybe a few years ago maybe not too many and he’s very much a part of this community. So I want to thank you Will for your welcome to your home here today and to Tasmania. I’m here just to stand with the people of the Huon and the people of Tasmania, I want to thank them for their great spirit as I’ve moved around and chatted, that humble resilience that we see in Australian communities all across our country and it’s very much on display here. While this is a difficult time, you always see things to celebrate and the nature of the people and their resilience and their generosity and their grace I think is extraordinary. I thank them and commend them.

JOURNALIST: Just one more on the fires again?

PRIME MINISTER: Sure.

JOURNALIST: We’ve seen so many resources called in from interstate and overseas, is there a need for more funding and more resources based in Tasmania, just to nip things in the bud before they get to this point?

PRIME MINISTER: Well look – Will may want to comment on that but this is the whole point of our national approach to managing the assets that are available. It is meant to be able to actually move and be flexible to bring those assets to bear where they’re needed, to anywhere around the country. So there are assets that are present in the state and there are others that can be called in at very short notice. I think that’s what we’ve seen here today and I think what we’re seeing is that programme and those standing arrangements are working. We’re always boosting those resources and funding.

PREMIER OF TASMANIA: Yeah and it’s something obviously that once this event passes, we will of course take the opportunity to talk with other jurisdictions in the Commonwealth about how we best coordinate our effort. One of the first questions I’ve asked and my minister has asked from day one, is whether or not we have satisfactory capability here in Tasmania and whether with supplementation from forces from interstate, that’s adequate to meet the fire challenge we face. The answer has been unequivocally yes. We do have that capability. It does not mean that there wont be lessons we learn from this experience, there will of course be an opportunity to again revisit this once the event passes. But the most important thing that Tasmanians can be assured of – and this comes from experts, true experts, not those who are in the game of offering political advice and gratuitous advice, this comes from our experts that are fighting the fires, whether it be our aerial capability or on the ground, supplemented by those who have come from other places, which we are so grateful for – we have the capability to fight the fires.

ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS: Just one final note on that is, again reminds, the question is that these are very important assets. The aerial assets are very, very important and they’ve made a very significant difference here, but still, it is still the men and women on the ground from the Tasmanian fire service that have done an extraordinary job over the last week fighting these fires. The aerial assets are important but they assist the men and the women on the ground. What they have done is they’ve used them in very clever ways, each different aircraft, to actually assist those on the ground to get in and actually fight some of these fire fronts. So they’re an important tool but it never replaces the men and women on the ground.

PRIME MINISTER: Any other questions? Okay, well let me make a couple of comments about other issues. I don’t plan to be making any comments, obviously, on the Royal Commission at this press conference, there is a process in place for that. There is a lockup that is going on this afternoon and the Treasurer will be releasing the Government’s response to the royal commission later today and that’s the appropriate time for any comments on that matter, particularly given that markets are open at the moment. We have a very careful process for managing the release of this very significant report and the Government’s response.

On the second, I just want to confirm again, what the Minister for Immigration has announced this morning. That is, that the Government must remain in control of our border protection regime. It cannot be subcontracted out to anybody, anybody at all. So what we’ve announced today is the Government will be ensuring, solidifying the fact that the Government remains in control of our border protection framework. What we’re doing is we’re putting in place an independent panel to be appointed by the government, by Cabinet, no one else. The Government will appoint those members. This is a process of transparency and assurance over the processes that we have in place to manage medical issues in relation to services and support that are available in Nauru and Manus. We are not taking away the decisions one bit, from those officials and clinical professionals that are currently making those decisions, but I believe it is an improvement to the system, to ensure that there is a review process for those clinical decisions. That where that review process suggests that particular clinical matters should be reconsidered, that can be done. That would be done through the Home Affairs Department but the final decision will remain with the Home Affairs Department and there will be a biannual reporting process for the purpose of transparency, back to the Parliament, through the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. These are improvements to, I believe our border protection framework. Because it gives Australians the assurance and that transparency that no longer will we have a place where people can go and make all sorts of outrageous allegations against those who are providing medical care in these places, there will be the assurance of an independent panel that will report to the Parliament. I think that will provide that certainty and that guarantee but the process will remain as it is and this provides, I think, the right type of assurance for Australians who - like we are all – are concerned about the welfare of any individuals. So what the Parliament does next week is a matter for them. But I do know this and I’m writing to the Leader of the Opposition today, it’s a pretty clear message and I made it very clear yesterday; with the last four of the children who were on Nauru, with their bags packed and ready to go to the United States, we will have gotten all the children off Nauru. That’s what we’ve achieved as a Government and we’ve done it without compromising our border protection framework. Secondly these new transparency and assurance arrangements for the delivery of health services which includes additional mental health services in Papua New Guinea, will mean that Australians can be very confident about the way that those services are being delivered. The bill that Labor currently supports would see offshore processing regional processing abolished as we know it. It would basically render it useless in our border protection framework because it would subcontract out those decisions from the Government, to any two clinicians on Skype. There wouldn’t even have to be, wouldn’t even have to be an understood treatment requirement only the need to be able to see the patient in person. These patients are being seen in person by clinicians in each of these countries and the independent process with the panel will give Australians the assurance that will now be oversighted. So there is no reason whatsoever for Labor to abolish offshore processing as we know it and I would urge the Leader of the Opposition to change their position on this. Because what will happen, the advice we have received from our security agencies is, that this will see detention centres reopened in Australia, hundreds of people being transferred from regional processing locations to Australia within weeks and months. This will come at great cost and then we will see the boats start again. There is no reason to support these amendments other than cheap politics of trying to pull on a vote in the House of Representatives next week. So that’s what that issue is about. Bill Shorten should reconsider his position and put the national interest first.

JOURNALIST: Did Cabinet approve this change?

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah it was approved by the National Security Committee of Cabinet.

JOURNALIST: Have you had any, regard from independent Cathy McGowan? Has she indicated to your Government whether she backs this change?

PRIME MINISTER: I’ve been in discussions with Cathy for months -

JOURNALIST: You said in December; “We’ve got a clear policy, it’s working it’s worked for five years.” What has actually changed between now and then?

PRIME MINISTER: Well nothing has changed, I’m simply providing a layer of assurance and transparency. I think we’re adding, adding to this. I mean I think these debates over the last few months have said that the public are looking for greater assurance. Now I don’t have a problem with that and I’m happy to provide it. But the border protection framework is unchanged, it is not compromised one inch. I would never compromise a border protection framework that I built.

JOURNALIST: So is it actually necessary, this kind of …?

PRIME MINISTER: I think it provides an assurance to the health services that are being provided, to Australians and it actually protects the border protection framework from I think, the spurious and unfair commentary that is made on the delivery of those services. So I think it improves public confidence in the integrity of the system.

JOURNALIST: Are you announcing this to avoid possible embarrassment next week when Phelps’ bill is debated in Parliament?

PRIME MINISTER: No, it is a decision of the Government that is proceeding, it is made in it’s own right. What I’m saying to Bill Shorten is, don’t blame the independents if you’re going to go and dismantle Australia’s border protection framework.

They’re already going to get rid of temporary protection visas and provide permanent visas to people who have illegally entered Australia.

They have already made that decision. Now they’ve already made a decision to abolish offshore processing and regional processing, by contracting out the powers over that to people other than the Government.

So two of the key planks are gone under Labor and Labor should reconsider their position. I’ve simply provided further assurance about the medical processes that are already in place. I think that adds to the system and I consider it a step up, not a step back.

JOURNALIST: But why announce it now, one week out?

PRIME MINISTER: Because I had to take it through Cabinet.

JOURNALIST: Are you confident in Ian Goodenough’s position?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

JOURNALIST: Can you guarantee he’s done nothing wrong?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, that’s a matter for the independent processes that have been set up to investigate any of those matters, so I’m not going to prejudice those, I’m not going to prejudice Ian either. I don’t think it’s a good thing to do to jump to any conclusions, there’s an independent process for that and I’m sure it will do its job and Ian, I know, will be very happy to work with that.

JOURNALIST: Are we close to getting a final signature on the Hobart City Deal?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

JOURNALIST: Any idea of the timeframe for that?

PRIME MINISTER: Soon.

JOURNALIST: We’ve been saying that since before Christmas.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah well that means it’s even sooner.

[Laughter]

Will knows, we’ve been working closely together on this. You know, it’s the first week of February and we’ve been working very closely on this. So has Eric and so has Richard and we’re very close on this front and I’m looking forward to that. But to be honest I didn’t come here today to as you know, to talk about Hobart city deals and other issues in Tasmania. The reason I’ve come today is to stand with the people of Huon and to stand with the people of Tasmania and let them know that all Australians are supporting them and backing them in.


PRIME MINISTER: Nǐ hǎo. Gong hei fat choy. It’s wonderful to be here - can everybody hear me? It’s wonderful to be here with the Lord Mayor, it’s wonderful to be here with my wife Jenny who has joined me and come down from Sydney today. It’s great to be here with Gladys Liu, my Liberal Candidate here for Chisolm and Kate Ashmor, the Liberal candidate here for Macnamara and all the other distinguished guests who are here. Members of the committee, those who have been part of this celebration for so many years.

It’s a great thrill for me to be here as a Sydneysider because so often we come down to Melbourne to see how these things are done and they’re done so well here in Melbourne. And it’s wonderful to come and enjoy the celebrations for Lunar New Year, as Jenny and I have often enjoyed the celebrations for Chinese new year up in Sydney and Chinatown there with our magnificent Chinese community as well. So it’s great to be able to bring those two together here tonight.

Now, Chinese New Year has a very long history here in Melbourne. Indeed, right across Victoria, as you go back into the 1860’s where the Chinese has been celebrating this most important time for their families and their communities. And there was the famed Imperial Dragon Loong who was brought to Melbourne from Bendigo in 1901 to take part in the procession and to celebrate Federation. So when our very nation, our very nation was formed, there in the middle of the procession was Loong the Chinese dragon that was a part of those celebrations and continues up until 1970. I understand the same dragon was part of the celebration here in Melbourne every single year.

So this is a wonderful time for family, it’s a wonderful time for community and it’s an opportunity for me as Prime Minister to say to all Australians of Chinese heritage and to those who celebrate the Lunar New Year out of Vietnam, out of Korea, out of other places, to say thanks for the wonderful contribution that all of you have made to Australia over so many generations. Not just recently, but over 160 and more year where we have seen the Chinese community first of all coming and making a great contribution.

Now I look over here at the emblem of the pig, the twelfth of the Chinese zodiac as I understand it. And it is the year of prosperity, it is the year of working hard, it is the year of wealth and that’s why Chinese immigrants came to Australia so long ago. To understand that they could have the opportunity to work hard, to start businesses, to support their children in education and to be able to go on and do such tremendous things. Helping build our cities, helping build our regions. This is the great legacy of Chinese Australians over such a long period of time.

We have 1.2 million Australians of Chinese heritage here and Gladys Liu is of course one of them. When she first came here in 1985 as a student and studied speech pathology and went on to become an Australian citizen in 1992 and raised here family here as so many Chinese Australians have come and done that very thing.

So that’s what we celebrate. Chinese New Year is now a great Australian celebration, not just a celebration within the Chinese community. And as I look out tonight, I see Australians of all backgrounds. I see Indian Australians, Namaste to all the Indian Australians who are here tonight. And Australians from so many different backgrounds. I see children, I see people of all generations and that’s so wonderful that we can celebrate it here as a true Australian community tonight. So xièxiè and thank you all very much.

PRIME MINISTER: This is the year of the pig, which means it’s the year of prosperity and wealth, and this is something that I know the Chinese community understands here well in Australia, coming to Australia more than 160 years ago to find both prosperity and wealth here in Australia.

There are 1.2 million Australians of Chinese heritage here in Australia. There are some 200,000 more Chinese students studying here in Australia and almost 560,000 or thereabouts who have been born in China and come to Australia.

You have worked hard for what you have achieved here in Australia. You’re working hard here in Australia and I want to thank you on behalf of all Australians for making Australia stronger, for making our economy stronger, and for making Australia a more prosperous and wealthy nation.

Australia brings stories from all over the world and our timeless indigenous stories to make Australia what it is today, and the Chinese Australian story is a very strong one and a key part of who we are as a modern nation. And it is important that we celebrate here, as a local community, this wonderful Chinese heritage here in Australia. May it forever prosper.

So to all of you, to the organising committees, to the sponsors, to the leadership of the local Chinese community here in Box Hill and the city of Whitehorse I say thank you very much on behalf of Jenny and I for your welcome here today and the wonderful presentation that you have put on. I trust you will enjoy today, I trust you will have a very prosperous, a very happy new year with you and your family.


PRIME MINISTER: It’s been great to here in Brisbane all week actually, we’ve had a really, really strong week and great to see so many wonderful people out and about.

HOST: Before we have a proper chat we should take care of business because we’ve been saying that we’re going to do ‘Smarter than Suse’ so let’s do that first and then we’ll have a proper chat after, see how you go against Sue.

PRIME MINISTER: Sure this is, you know, this is crunch time.

SUSIE: Yeah it’s cattle stations

HOST: Are you aware of the stickers? There’s that one if you win.

PRIME MINISTER: Well my secret in life is to always have assumed that I’m never the smartest person in the room. Plenty of people assume the opposite and usually get themselves into trouble.

HOST: Either with the honest part or Suse sticker-

HOST: A lot to play for.

HOST: I’m not smarter than Suse either.

SUSIE: Here we go.

[Introduction music audio played]

Australian swimming legend Susie O’Neill versus Australian Prime Minister Scott ‘ScoMo’ Morrison.

HOST: So Suse is in the sound proof booth, you can testify to that ScoMo.

PRIME MINISTER: [inaudible]

HOST: It is legit she can’t hear us in there. Now I don’t if your people behind the scenes have explain the rules or I’ll go through it here.

PRIME MINISTER: Go through them.

HOST: So what you’ve gone on, I’m going to ask you five questions. You’ve got 30 seconds to answer those five questions, OK? Now if you want to you can pass and we’ll come back to it.

PRIME MINISTER: OK.

HOST: But Suse never gets beaten on time and if it’s a draw the person with the quickest time wins.

PRIME MINISTER: Sure.

HOST: So don’t pass, just say you don’t know and move on.

HOST: If you say don’t know I’ll just go straight on to the next question.

HOST: Won’t come back to it.

PRIME MINISTER: OK let’s see how we go.

HOST: Alright, Prime Minister you’ve up against Susan. Prime Minister you’ve got 30 seconds on the clock and your time starts now. What is the capital of New Zealand?

PRIME MINISTER: Wellington.

HOST: Name the comedian who withdrew from hosting the 2019 Oscars?

PRIME MINISTER: Pass.

HOST: Spell vacuum.

PRIME MINISTER: V A C U U M.

HOST: What kind of animal is the Disney character Dumbo?

PRIME MINISTER: An elephant.

HOST: What is 176 minus 86?

PRIME MINISTER: 90.

HOST: Name the comedian who withdrew from hosting the 2019 Oscars? Dunno?

PRIME MINISTER: Dunno.

HOST: So stop, stop. Yeah so we had to go back because you said pass.

PRIME MINISTER: Oh sorry.

HOST: You burnt some time there, that’s what I’m sort of saying but that’s alright. Not bad, not bad on time you had five seconds left.

HOST: It was pretty good.

HOST: So if it comes down to it that could be enough-

HOST: She sometimes struggles on the spelling too.

HOST: Here she comes now by the way PM you are playing for Brenda from Aspley so if you beat-

HOST: She’s one of your constituents. Is Aspley one of your seats? I don’t know what that would be um, I don’t think is.

PRIME MINISTER: No, no it’s a long way north.

HOST: You could win, you could a win a vote here.

PRIME MINISTER: Cronulla is a long way from Aspley.

HOST: Yeah I think Aspley might be within a Labor seat.

SUSIE: I was just checking my previous results against ah, I beat Turnbull.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah.

HOST: Oh did you?

SUSIE: I lost against Shorten.

HOST: Oh OK, alright.

PRIME MINISTER: I’m not planning to do that.

[Laughter]

HOST: This could be a benchmark here, let’s see how we go.

HOST: [Advertising read out].

Now this is tradition Prime Minister that Susie has her own song.

HOST: Pump her up for code of conduct? In general terms don’t put a balaclava over your head when you’re in the same room as the Prime Minister but he has to do this as a thing.

[Music played]

HOST: We’ve got to explain to the Prime Minister why you’re wearing what you’re wearing right now.

HOST: Susie says it distracts from the fact that I’ve got a huge nose and I’ve got a forehead, a massive forehead and googly eyes and I sometimes put her off so she’s asked for me to wear the ski mask-

SUSIE: It’s self-explanatory you didn’t really need to explain it.

[Laughter]

HOST: It’s really ugly, that’s what it is, yeah.

HOST: Do you do that with any of your employees, do you ask them to wear a ski mask?

HOST: There’s one in every office.

PRIME MINISTER: No.

HOST: Don’t do it?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

SUSIE: Don’t answer that.

HOST: Alright, Susan O’Neill up against the Prime Minister you’ve got 30 seconds on the clock and your time starts now.  What is the capital of New Zealand?

SUSIE: Christchurch.

HOST: Name the comedian who withdrew from hosting the 2019 Oscars?

SUSIE: Jimmy Kimmel.

HOST: Spell vacuum?

SUSIE: V A C double U M.

HOST: What kind of animal is the Disney character Dumbo?

SUSIE: He’s an elephant.

HOST: What is 176 minus 86?

SUSIE: 90.

HOST: Stop the clock.  

HOST: Quick, that’s good on time. You had ten seconds left Suse. Prime Minister had five so in the event of a tie breaker Susie wins.

PRIME MINISTER: Well done Susie, well done.

HOST: [inaudible]

HOST: Only in the event of a tie breaker.

PRIME MINISTER: Oh we’ve got to go again?

HOST: No, no. We just go through the score, yeah.

PRIME MINISTER: Let’s go through it.

HOST: OK the capital of New Zealand, Prime Minister said it was Wellington. Suse you said it was Christchurch.  It’s Wellington.

SUSIE: Is it? How do you know that?

HOST: Because he’s the Prime Minister.

HOST: He went to Sydney Boys High.

PRIME MINISTER: If I didn’t know it would be a problem.

[Laughter]

HOST: How offended would New Zealand be?

HOST: Can you imagine if you answered that incorrectly? That would have been worldwide news today.

HOST: The New Zealand PM on the phone. You what? You said what?

HOST: It’s one nil to the Prime Minister. Name the comedian who withdrew from the hosting the 2019 Oscars. PM passed and then came back and didn’t know.  You said it was Jimmy-

HOST: Jimmy Kimmel or something.

HOST: Kevin Hart.

SUSIE: Oh, that’s right.

HOST: It’s one nil Prime Minister.  Top of the third spell vacuum, you both said V A C U U M. You’re on the board Suse.  Two one to the PM.  What kind of animal is the Disney character Dumbo? You both said elephant it’s three two to the Prime Minister. 176 minus 86 is 90 you both said that it’s a four three victory and the PM has done what Malcolm Turnbull couldn’t and what Bill Shorten did and that is prove that he’s smarter than Suse. 

HOST: Well done.

SUSIE: Well done Scott.

PRIME MINISTER: Well-

HOST: And we hand over the official sticker which I’m sure you’ll appreciate.

PRIME MINISTER: She’s the bigger legend there’s no doubt about that.

SUSIE: She’s the cat’s mother [laughter] sorry that’s a private joke.

HOST: Brenda out at Aspley picked up 100 bucks too and maybe a vote for you I’d have to say.

PRIME MINISTER: Good on you Brenda tell your friends.

HOST: And we’ll come back and chat with the Prime Minister right after this.

[Advertisement/traffic advice/music break]

PRIME MINISTER: That’s what this stuff is about I mean, I mean I’m you know families are important, families should have meals together at night and not spend, you know, the evenings-

HOST: [Inaudible] in traffic, what you realise is how quickly Brisbane is growing, I mean Ash drives from the coast every day I did it this morning from down at Coolangatta and if you’re not past Springwood by 20 past 5 you’re done, like it’s gridlock at that hour, people are up early, there’s so many more people on the roads so it’s moving, the wheels keep moving.

PRIME MINISTER: That’s the big thing I think in Brisbane say over the last ten/15 years I mean, you know, I grew up in Sydney and it’s always been congested and we’ve got to do a lot there too and Melbourne is the same but Brisbane has been growing really rapidly and that’s been great because people’s businesses have been growing and they’ve been doing well and there’s lots of jobs and that’s all fantastic but you’ve got to keep the congestion busting happening.

So I was at Indooroopilly public school yesterday and we’re upgrading the drop off area there as well so these really small things in the scheme, these aren’t you know billion dollar projects they’re just $7 million here, $5 million here, $12 million here and they’re going to make a big difference to those intersections. Safety as well, as well as getting home and getting on the site, you know, plenty of tradies I’m sure listening this morning they don’t make any money sitting in traffic they make it when they get on site.

HOST: Have you noticed the scooters around? Because Brisbane is like the test city for those electric scooters.

PRIME MINISTER: Oh yeah, I saw a bloke zipping along Story Bridge yesterday.

HOST: Yeah, they’re everywhere.

PRIME MINSTER: He was fanging it, he was-

HOST: I don’t get it quite frankly.

HOST: I reckon they’re brilliant, yeah. So what do you reckon about them? Do you have an opinion on them yet?

PRIME MINISTER: Oh I don’t really care but so long as they’re safe and they don’t run into people.

HOST: I mean you could have idiots riding ‘em because that’s human nature but you know on the whole they’re getting people off the roads you know, getting people scooting-

HOST: So is that only Brisbane?

HOST: Only Brisbane at this stage.

HOST: It’s a test for Australia, yeah.

PRIME MINISTER: Kids like Segways and these things, I mean Segways are important tools for people with disabilities.

HOST: Yeah, yeah that’s alright, yeah.

HOST: I would never step on a Segway, it seems incredibly dangerous to me.

HOST: And the PM was telling a story, sorry Suse, PM was telling us off air that you swim every day, like you started incorporating swimming into your, into your routine now.

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah I do well it’s for exercise but I’m a firm believer that politicians’ exercise should be kept very, not done in public, it’s not a pretty sight.

HOST: Well how do you do that then?

PRIME MINISTER: Oh you make the time, it’s a good head space and it’s also, you know, good exercise and you know you’ve got to do that in these sorts of jobs and I’m enjoying it.

HOST: DTs or boardies?

PRIME MINISTER: As I said it’s done in private.

[Laughter]

HOST: It’s very much done in private.

HOST: I want to say nude?

HOST: What’s a tip Suse, what’s the tip?

SUSIE: Not a tip I was going to, I was actually going to say don’t wear budgie smugglers-

[Laughter]

HOST: It’s been done hasn’t it?

SUSIE: [Inaudible] I love it, it’s great stress release isn’t it?

PRIME MINISTER: Yeah it is I just got to get the breathing right and I’m getting it there, I’ve got up to about 600 metres a day so that’s, if I can do it all in one go it will be even better.

[Laughter]

HOST: Good on ya.

HOST: How long are you in Brissy for?

PRIME MINISTER: Oh I’ve been here all week, I’m heading back down to Sydney tonight.

HOST: Thanks for coming in.

PRIME MINISTER: No, no it’s great to be here, thanks for the fun and thanks for the opportunity to-

HOST: You might have to race Susie in the pool next time.

SUSIE: Oh that’s a good idea because I’d win that one.

PRIME MINISTER: I’ll just take this one, I’m not faster than Susie right now.

HOST: And finally we all saw a picture of Shorten during the week making his kids’ lunches which I’m sure he does every day, I’m sure that wasn’t a photo op-

PRIME MINISTER: The strategically placed Vegemite sitting there. I didn’t think there was anything contrived about that.

HOST: No, no it seemed very natural.

PRIME MINISTER: Really fair dinkum.

HOST: But he was making his, that was the worst picture by the way, but he was making his kids’ sandwiches with wholemeal bread. Don’t do that to your children.

PRIME MINISTER: I don’t make the kids’ lunches.

HOST: You don’t?

PRIME MINISTER: I don’t make them. They’ll be happy about that. I can cook them a great curry which I often do on a Saturday night with the kids and they help but no, no, I don’t make the lunches.

HOST: Have you ever said when a kid goes Dad can you do something, you go gosh I thought I was the Prime Minister?

[Laughter]

HOST: I’d be dropping that every day.

[Laughter]

PRIME MINISTER: That’s true at most places but not my house. 

LEIGH SALES: Prime Minister welcome to 7.30 for 2019.

PRIME MINISTER: Great to be back Leigh.

LEIGH SALES: The Coalition has been in an election losing position in the polls for virtually its entire term. You have members of your frontbench choosing not to contest the election, high profile independents are running in key Liberal seats, cashed up groups like GetUp! are targeting you in vital marginal seats, all this against the recent backdrop of Coalition disunity and instability.

Is the kind of talk you’re engaging in today of re-election and ten year plans wishful thinking?

PRIME MINISTER: No, Leigh, I mean, just as well I’m a fighter when you listen to what you’ve just relayed out there which is I think is a particularly pessimistic way to look at things. I’m not looking at things like that at all.

What I’ve announced today is that we’ve got a goal, a pledge in fact of one and a quarter million new jobs and that’s not a vague promise because we’ve already delivered 1.2 million jobs as a government since we were first elected so that’s what I’m focussed on; a stronger economy to guarantee the essentials that Australians rely on.

That’s our record as a government, a good strong policy record and a clear plan that I announced today to take us into the future. Not a future with higher taxes but a future of a stronger economy which Australians need.

LEIGH SALES: When you’re talking about, as you say 1.25 million jobs, also income tax cuts, more spending on health and education, return to surplus, a ten year plan to eliminate debt. For you to achieve all of that you have to assume a continual best case scenario on lots of economic external factors instead of a pragmatic one. That is the definition of wishful thinking.

PRIME MINISTER: No that’s actually not true, Leigh, I mean doing what we’ve pledged today on jobs would actually not be at the peak rate of jobs growth that we’ve achieved over the last couple of years so I think that-

LEIGH SALES: But it’s the environment with all those other factors-

PRIME MINISTER: No, no not at all, Leigh. One of the marks of our economic management is that we’ve always exceeded expectations. One of the reasons that as Treasurer I was able to ensure that we maintained our AAA credit rating is I said we would hit a surplus in 2021, well we’re going to hit it in 19/20.

I have a track record of under promising and over delivering whether it’s on the economy, border protection, welfare reforms Leigh. My record, our government’s record is delivering and today we’ve set out new plans to deliver in the future for the stronger economy which enables us to list lung care medicines and get meningococcal vaccines to young Australians.

LEIGH SALES: On this point though that you’ve exceeded, that your government has exceeded expectations the Coalition record, doesn’t that pitch simply confuse voters along the lines of ‘well, hang on if your record is so good why did you need to dump Malcolm Turnbull?’

PRIME MINISTER: Well that was last year, Leigh, and what we’re focussed on is the plan we’re taking to the next election. It’s a plan based on our policy successes as a-

LEIGH SALES: [inaudible]

PRIME MINISTER: …government over the last five, I know your point is-

LEIGH SALES: My point is that-

PRIME MINISTER: Your point is about politics-

LEIGH SALES: [inaudible] aren’t you confusing, no aren’t you confusing voters? You’re saying our record is so fantastic, we’ve exceeded expectations it’s confusing to people, they just saw a Prime Minister get dumped a matter of months ago.

PRIME MINISTER: My break over the summer involved talking to people who were sharing with me about their need for having their job secure, being able to get home in time to spend time with their families which is why today I announced another $240 million going into urban congestion busting projects here in South East Queensland and that’s what we’re focussed on; the things that actually improve people’s lives. We’ve got a great track record of delivering on infrastructure because people can see the earth machine, moving machinery on sites now. 

We’ve got a great record on tax cuts because we’ve passed that through the Parliament with legislation. We’ve got a great track record on bringing the budget back to surplus because we will have the first surplus achieved by a government in 12 years when Josh brings that down on the 2nd April this year.

So that’s our policy record. What you’re talking about is politics. That’s a different thing.

LEIGH SALES: On policy you also have a plan you were discussing today, a ten year plan to wipe out debt, but that would mean for that plan to reach fruition the Coalition would be re-elected three times, there would be no external shocks. What do you say to the suggestion that that’s a plan at best based on rose coloured glasses and at worst a fantasy?

PRIME MINISTER: No what I said today is my goal is to see that debt gone, net debt gone by 2030. Now the decisions that made in the next three years in the budget will determine what happens with that budget over the next ten years. How do I know that? When Labor last came in 2007 the decisions they took in their first term actually led to the debt position we are in today. 

So no it’s not fantasy, it’s fair dinkum.  The decisions that are taken and in the next budget, the budget after that, the budget after that will determine the debt trajectory of our nation and the tax trajectory-

LEIGH SALES: Sorry, just while you’re on debt, you’ve been in office now for six years, you point out that Labor had a debt problem. Net debt at the end of their term in office was $202 billion, net debt today is $341 billion, you’ve taken it in the wrong direction.

PRIME MINISTER: Well because we’ve had to wind back the deficits of Labor and get the budget back into balance. You can’t reduce debt, Leigh, if you’re still running deficits. And so we’ve had to take down, from the record deficits of Labor, to bring the budget back into a surplus position for the next financial year. Now you can’t pay down debt until you get back into surplus and it has taken us the last five and a half years to wind back the baked in spending excesses of the Labor Party, to get the budget under control, and now we’ve turned the corner on debt and if we keep making those decisions that’s why my goal is you keep making those decisions and you will wipe out debt within 10 years. If you go down Labor’s path, you won’t.

LEIGH SALES: While we’re on Labor, you’ve said repeatedly today that the Australian economy will be weaker under a Labor government because it will impose higher taxes.

PRIME MINISTER: Correct.

LEIGH SALES: Where’s your evidence that higher taxes weaken an economy?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I think it’s just fundamental economics 101, Leigh.

LEIGH SALES: But the Howard Government imposed a very big new tax on Australia, the GST, are you saying they weakened the economy?

PRIME MINISTER: No, they abolished taxes at the same time, Leigh. They actually lessened the overall individual tax burden on Australians. That’s why I don’t want to see, and I’ve legislated it at this end, in 94 per cent of cases, more than 32.5 cents in the dollar in tax. I’ve already cut taxes for small business. Today, I announced we’re cutting taxes further for small business by increasing the instant asset write off to $25,000 and that’s over $750 million worth of small businesses’ own money that they get to keep.

Lower taxes have been a key part of our economic plan that has generated record jobs growth, 1.2 million. The strongest growth in a year for young people, for people over 55, for women, right across the board, getting people off welfare and into work and a key part of our economic plan has been lower taxes. Labor wants to put a sheet anchor on the economy in $200 billion in higher taxes.

LEIGH SALES: But by your logic, if higher taxes in and of themselves generally weaken an economy, a country like Norway should be weak but it has some of the highest taxes in the world and yet the average Norwegian is richer and has a higher standard of living than the average Australian.

PRIME MINISTER: Australia has had 27 years of continuous economic growth. We are at the top of the leader pack when it comes to advanced developed economies in the world for economic growth, the world is looking to us in terms of how we’ve been able to succeed and how we’ve been able to succeed as a government is by keeping taxes low, backing small business, investing in infrastructure so people can get home on time and tradies can spend more time on the time and not in a traffic jam, expanding our export markets, defence industry procurement plans. I mean, this is how we’ve been growing the economy and the plan I announced today builds on that success.

LEIGH SALES: On the 1.25 million jobs that you’re promising if re-elected, of those how many will be filled by migrants?

PRIME MINISTER: Well migrants form part of the overall population flows into the country, we don’t have a breakdown of that, Leigh.

LEIGH SALES: Of the million jobs you’ve created how many have been filled by migrants?

PRIME MINISTER: I don’t have those figures to hand, Leigh. What I do know is that population growth has not run as high as jobs growth. So that means jobs growth has been at a higher rate than population growth and has been running at a higher rate than migration growth.

LEIGH SALES: Would it surprise you that half of the million jobs you’ve created were filled by migrants?

PRIME MINISTER: What I’m saying, Leigh, is that all Australians who are living here are getting more jobs today than they were before. When we came to office, the rate of jobs growth in Australia under Labor was 0.2 per cent, today, it’s 2.2 per cent. It’s 11 times higher. We inherited a basket case of a jobs program under the Labor Party and we’ve turned it into one of the biggest jobs generating governments in the history of the country.

LEIGH SALES: Let’s quickly run through some other issues before we run out of time. The Banking Royal Commission, does your government commit to implementing all of Commissioner Hayne’s recommendations?

PRIME MINISTER: Well in principle this is what our intention would be, but we’ve obviously got to see a report before we make a decision on that and that’s why the Treasurer has announced today that in a very measured process, over the weekend, once we receive that report which will be in the middle of a market day so you wouldn’t go and release it while the markets were open, the government will consider that over the weekend and provide an interim and initial, if not final, response on the Monday after the lockup after markets close. Now that’s important to ensure that there’s stability in the financial system, you don’t go shocking financial markets, you take your time on this. But I think that is a reasonable timeframe to ensure the Royal Commission report is released in a timely way and done so in a way which maximises stability for the financial system.

LEIGH SALES: We’ve seen evidence in those hearings of banks effectively stealing from customers, for example charging people for financial advice that they never intended to provide, would you expect criminal charges to flow from the Royal Commission?

PRIME MINISTER: I’m going to wait to see what he recommends, I’m not going to speculate on it. But I want to commend Commissioner Hayne for the outstanding job he has done. He has kept it in the time frame, he has got it done. He has also been very mindful, I think, of the impact of this Royal Commission on the financial system, and I think he’s been very careful not to exacerbate problems, particularly around credit restrictions. Now we have seen a fair bit of that happening. That has been impacting on the economy. So it’s important we ensure stability on how we respond to this report, and making sure the economy can continue to kick along without any unnecessary shocks.

LEIGH SALES: Three of your ministers, as I mentioned earlier, have said that they won’t recontest the federal election. You’ve said today that it’s offensive that their stated personal reasons for leaving are twisted into politics, for a political motivation.

PRIME MINISTER: It is actually.

LEIGH SALES: Perception is everything in politics, and three ministers quitting gives voters the perception of rats deserting a sinking ship.

PRIME MINISTER: Well who is creating that perception? The Labor Party have.

LEIGH SALES: Well haven’t three ministers in a row by saying they… [inaudible]

PRIME MINISTER: No they haven’t, because they have made very clear their personal reasons for doing that. Just like Gai Brodtmann did, just like Kate Ellis did, just like Jenny Macklin did, just like Wayne Swan did, just like Jacinta Collins has done, and what I find upsetting is, you know me Leigh, I’m for family values and when people raise issues like miscarriages with me, I’m not going to be so insensitive as to not understand fully the reasons for that decision. I think it’s pretty disappointing that Bill Shorten would cast a slur on Liberal members for genuine family reasons for leaving, but when it comes to Labor members it’s ok, I think this shows a failing of character, he should have just wished us well. He should have just wished Kelly O’Dwyer well. It’s ok for Tim Hammond, a bloke from Western Australia to say he is not going to stay one term of parliament, but for Kelly, who has served the parliament for almost 10 years, for her to leave because of quite personal reasons, particularly relating to issues that I’m sure all Australians would want to wish her well, I just find frankly quite disappointing.

LEIGH SALES: Just quickly, if the Coalition loses the election do you commit to staying on as leader of the party and therefore opposition leader?

PRIME MINISTER: I’m committed to winning the next election, and in the Liberal Party…

LEIGH SALES: If you lose though? As you said before it is a tough job.

PRIME MINISTER: It’s a tough job. That’s not my plan. Australia can’t afford Bill Shorten as a Prime Minister so I’ve got every energy flying into that and the leadership of the Liberal Party is always the gift of the parliamentary Liberal Party and I never make any presumptions upon it.

LEIGH SALES: And just finally on this programme recently Mr Shorten committed to doing two prime time interviews with 7.30 during the election campaign, would you be prepared to commit to the same?

PRIME MINISTER: We’ll go through the normal process of setting those Leigh, I’ve always been very available to 7.30 and always enjoy our friendly chats. 

LEIGH SALES: Well in that vein I look forward to seeing you twice in the election campaign, thank you very much.

PRIME MINISTER: Good on you Leigh. Good to talk to you.

DOORSTOP, CANBERRA

PRIME MINISTER: It’s great to be out here enjoying Australia Day. Make sure to be sun smart and be conscious of the heat and take a look at the people next to you and make sure they’re OK as well as they’re out enjoying this wonderful day all around the country. And with that, we know that around the country today, particularly down in Victoria and Tasmania, there are Australians fighting bushfires down there today and our thoughts are with you and our support is there with you today on the frontline there. I particularly want to thank the New Zealand Government for the support New Zealand firefighters who are joining in on that fight. The terrain in New Zealand and Tasmania is quite similar and they have particular expertise. I spoke to Will Hodgman about all of this yesterday and we’re being kept up to date. So a difficult Australia Day down in Tassie and of course in Victoria with the other challenges they’re facing there.

But to Richard and Craig, congratulations on becoming our Australians of the Year. This is a story, this is an achievement and they are the first to tell you they were part of a very big team, as they did last night, that was able to perform this miracle up there in Thailand. It showed the best of Australia's expertise, the best of Australia's compassion, the best of Australia’s outward-looking nature and adventurous nature to be there and providing that support. But you know, a strong field, Kurt Fearnley and others, congratulations to the other nominees. You’re all heroes, you’re all absolute champions and you all deserve to be celebrated. And Michelle thank you for the wonderful job you've done over the last 12 months as Australian of the Year. And we look forward to those messages getting out over the next 12 months from our new Australians of the Year. It will be a tag team, it will be a double act. It has worked well once before as they went into partnership up there in Thailand and I know will again.

But this is a great day for Australians to come together. I'm looking forward to the rest of the day and for Australians to come together. As you know, Jenny and I and the girls had a wonderful time with the Ngunnawal people reflecting on the ancient and living history and culture that was there all the way up to this day 231 years ago and how we have gone into a new chapter of that time, and even now in our federation era, a new chapter again bringing the peoples of the world together as you saw recognised this morning. So happy Australia Day.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister on that point, we can see on the bridge behind you indigenous activists are marching. They want to see the Australia Day date changed out of respect. For them it’s a day of mourning. What do you say to indigenous Australians who find today a very difficult day, not a day for celebration?

PRIME MINISTER: Well today is not a day for crab-walking away from our history, as you heard me say today. I mean, 1788 26th of January for my ancestors it was a pretty difficult day as well. They came not by choice and in some pretty desperate circumstances. The thing is, Australia is the story of being overcome, to be able to see the better nature of Australians and the values we hold together, all races, all peoples, all cultures, all religions, all languages even. That’s what we actually celebrate today, that we are the great country we are today, despite many of the things we've had to face in the past. So you can't walk away from these things. You've got to come together around these things and that's why I think there is the opportunity for reconciliation, and to tell the stories of all Australia. Not just some. Today I spoke of all the stories of Australia. The ancient stories, the settlement stories, and of course there are the many other stories post-federation, of our Diggers and the service and the sacrifice. So they’re all there to be celebrated in our achievements. But everything else to be remembered because it gives us context, it gives us learnings, it gives us perspective. In my first speech, my maiden speech in the Parliament I said I want our history in full, high-definition colour, all elements of it, so we can appreciate it and understand it.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Nigel Scullion has now told you and announced that he will not be recontesting. It comes after Michael Keenan also announced he’ll be leaving the Parliament. How big a blow is this to your Government, Michael Keenan and Nigel Scullion will not be standing at the next election?

PRIME MINISTER: Well I mean in both cases, both Nigel and Michael had come to me and told me, first in Nigel’s case that he was retiring. Let’s not forget that both of these gentlemen have been serving in the Parliament for a very long time, Nigel in particular, over 20 years of service. He is retiring and it is OK to retire in this country. And in Michael's case, he entered Parliament in 2004. He has served as a Minister, he has served in the Parliament, he has served in his community and has four children. The youngest is an infant. I think in both of these cases - because this is how it has been shared with me by both of these men - about their own personal circumstances. We’ve had members retiring and not standing at the next election from both sides of politics, and it means nothing more than that. This is the time when people go away at the time of the break, they reflect on things, they make choices about their future. Australians are doing that all round the country at the moment. I don't think these cases are any different. Both will continue to serve in their ministerial portfolios. I had them sworn in with the Governor-General and they will continue to perform all of those duties. Both Nigel and Michael have done a great job and I thank them for their service to their country on this Australia Day.

JOURNALIST: Are they jumping off a sinking ship, Prime Minister?

PRIME MINISTER: No, I think that’s a… no, I don’t think that’s a very kind way to put it and I don’t think that really does respect the decisions that they’re made.

JOURNALIST: Can you guarantee that no other minister will resign from now until May?

PRIME MINISTER: Well there are none others before me.

JOURNALIST: Can you guarantee that no others...

PRIME MINISTER: Well members make their own decisions about these things. I'm sure Bill Shorten cannot make the same commitment.

JOURNALIST: Are you having any conversations with anyone else at the moment? Are we going to see sort of over the next week or two is it possible that we will see more?

PRIME MINISTER: Look I’m not having any other conversations about those matters. The conversations I’m having are about is an even stronger Australia. My team is focused on a stronger Australia. That guarantees the essential services that Australians rely on, that keeps Australians safe, that keeps Australians together, particularly on a day like today. I'm ensuring that our Government, both now and into the future as we seek re-election, will be able to continue to deliver on our plans for a strong economy that is guaranteeing those essential services that Australians rely on. That's our plan, that’s what we’re focused on. That's what our people are showing up to do. I thank Michael, I thank Nigel, for their service. I would ask the media to respect the decisions they have made and the context of those decisions which is about family and is about personal issues. I respect their choice, I respect Kelly's choice, I respect the members of the Labor Party and the choices that they have made about these things. I don't see any difference between any of those decisions.

JOURNALIST: How can you be sure the Coalition MPs aren’t losing hope of winning?

PRIME MINISTER: Because of their direct conversations with me. And I have had many of them over the break, I've met with many members. I see the reports about Craig Laundy and I catching up today. I caught up with him for about an hour during the week, he was overseas when I was calling many members over the break as you’d expect me to do as the leader, and I said let’s catch up for brekky when you get back and that’s what we did.

JOURNALIST: Did you urge Mr Laundy to recontest his seat of Reid?

PRIME MINISTER: Craig, when we discussed what he was doing back in August of last year, he stepped down from the ministry at that point. And these are matters for Craig and his family and at present he is continuing forward.

JOURNALIST: Are you concerned these departures will affect the Government's chances of winning?

PRIME MINISTER: No.

JOURNALIST: They are both strong performing ministers, describe what their loss will be for the team.

PRIME MINISTER: Well they will continue to serve in their roles up until the next election. But what I will be equally pleased to see those who will come up and refresh behind them. All governments refresh and that’s a process which is going on in three of these seats. During the course of the week I had the opportunity to announce that Warren Mundine is part of the team. Now I don’t know the last time that the national president of a major party has decided to swap sides and say that that party no longer represents working people and they believe that the Liberal Party is the party that does that best for this country and provides the best hope for the future. Now I was greatly pleased to be able to sign up Warren. Warren's signing up to the Liberal Party I think is in direct conflict to the assertions that have been put about these other decisions being made by my colleagues for purely family reasons. So I've got people signing up to be part of my team and I've had people who have had a role in public life. I particularly pleased that Warren has signed up to our team and the contest he is now engaged in in Gilmore.

JOURNALIST: Do you want to say anything about Michael Keenan and...

PRIME MINISTER: I have worked with Michael over a long period of time. In fact Michael and I shared the border protection portfolio responsibilities when we were in opposition and we saw and lived through the horror of those years under Labor’s border protection failures and worked together as we went into the 2013 election and then implementing our policies in government. Michael’s history as a minister, he has served both in our national security agencies. The work he has done to keep Australians safe I commend him for. He has been a great member of the team and more recently he’s worked in human services. He's had a great vision around the way we can use digital technologies and other advances to make sure we have integrity in our social welfare net, but also that it can deliver to support where it needs to be delivered most. So I think he has been driving a very good agenda in digital government

And for Nige, I mean, there's no-one like Nige. There is no replacement for a Nigel Scullion. They broke the mould after Nige. He’s a passionate Territorian who I note is retiring. He's been serving a long time, and he is keen to pass on that mantle now to a new Senator who would seek to represent us out of the Northern Territory, and his passion for indigenous people is unequalled in the Parliament. His work on their practical circumstances, particularly in indigenous procurement policy, that is something that Nigel has championed as Minister. He has delivered real jobs to Indigenous Australians all around the country. As Warren Mundine reminded us this week, it was when his grandfather got a job that that changed the course of his family's life down generations. Nigel has been a champion or jobs for indigenous Australians. I’ve sat in the dust with Nigel in plenty of communities and his empathy and his ability to connect and respect with indigenous Australians is something I thank him for.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can you still guarantee a surplus on April 2?

PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

JOURNALIST: You mentioned Nigel handing over to a new Senator, who will that Senator be if you’re successful in getting that Senate spot?

PRIME MINISTER: Well we will have a preselection and the CLP are going to decide.

JOURNALIST: Do you think they would have retired if Malcolm Turnbull was still the Prime Minister?

PRIME MINISTER: Well you would have to ask them. Circumstances are the ones they reflected on over Christmas which you tend to do. I know Michael has been thinking about this for a long time, a very long time, and that would predate that change over. And Nigel also, Nigel has been in the Parliament through very long time and he has now decided it is the time to move on. And you know how it is with Senators, Senators contest elections and then they can stand down after an election and be replaced by the party. That’s enabled under our Constitution. That is not Nigel's form. Nige is an upfront person who wants to be upfront with the people of the Northern Territory and I think that’s a mark of the integrity and the honesty of the bloke.

JOURNALIST: If Julie Bishop moved out of Curtain, would you support Christian Porter moving into that seat?

PRIME MINISTER: Christian is 100 per cent plus committed to where he is running right now and always will be. He is passionate about his community and he has been running a very strong program for his local community and we will continue to do that. That’s where he’s committed, that’s where he lives, that’s what he is focused on and he is an outstanding Attorney and a key member of my team.

JOURNALIST: Are there any of your other colleagues who might be reflecting and considering leaving at the next election?

PRIME MINISTER: I think there has been the time for that and I respect all members' choices and I would ask you to respect all members' choices too and the reasons for why they are saying they are doing this. As Kelly pointed out, there are plenty of people who try, our political opponents and others, who try and use these circumstances I think for political opportunity and that is disappointing and I encourage people to not endorse the approach by giving that oxygen. I think that would be very disappointing and very discourteous to both of the gentlemen and their families. I mean, Michael's youngest child is an infant for goodness sake, so it's not surprising. Members, Tim Hammond, made the same decision, the same decision and he has only been here for a term, he hadn’t even finished a term. Michael has served many terms as a Western Australian MP, with three young children before that and now a fourth. Add so it comes a time when members really have to make these decisions in the best interests of their family, just like I am sure any of those listening to me would know and indeed all of you would do. So happy Australia Day. It's great to be here in Ngunnawal country celebrating the wonderful country Australia has become. We've got an amazing history and I think we always need to understand the lessons of our history but we should never look down on our achievements as a nation and today is a day for celebrating those achievements. Happy Australia Day. Thank you.


PRIME MINISTER: Well thank you very much and good morning everyone. Can I start by acknowledging the traditional owners, the Ngunnawal People here in Canberra, and their elders past, present and of course to acknowledge those in the future, who carry forward Australia’s oldest and indeed the world’s oldest living culture. This is a very important time to be acknowledging that.

Can I acknowledge my colleague who is also here, Steve Irons the Assistant Minister and can I particularly acknowledge Jen and the girls, who are very happy to be here hosting you all today for this very special gathering. To Danni Roche and all of her fellow board members and can I thank you in particular Danni on behalf, I think, of all of those who are participating here today, for the great work that you’ve done in bringing this all together. It’s such a big job to work through the incredible contributions that you have all made and it’s a great privilege for Jenny and I to host you here and welcome you here and most importantly, to hear all of your stories.

Doing this job is a wonderful privilege and you wake up each day in awe of the privilege you’ve been given and of course, the responsibility that you have. But today is a very special day, because today and tomorrow we remind ourselves of our shared history as Australians and we re-dedicate ourselves to Australia’s future. Our Australians of the Year, our Local Heroes, our Young Australians and Senior Australians of the Year, are a reflection of the very best of Australia. The very best of our stories. The very best of our contributions.

I was raised to understand that life wasn’t about what you accumulate, it’s about what you contribute – and everyone here is I think a model of that way of life and that way of thinking. You’re all incredible contributors to making Australia the strong nation it is today and even stronger into the future.

You’re very different. It’s a very eclectic bunch and you all got to know each other last night, I understand, on multiple occasions as the fire alarms went off at the hotel.

[Laughter]

You could all get together, so you’ve had some real togetherness time and I’m sure you enjoyed that on top of the additional chances you’ve had to meet in recent times. Paralympians are here, police officers are here, researchers, rescuers, mathematicians, mavericks, veterans, volunteers, footballers and fundraisers. You’re all here and you’re all Australians first and foremost.

In other ways you aren’t that different. As I’ve just mentioned, you’ve all grasped a very important truth; that a truly successful life is always one that embodies service to others. You love our country, as we all do. You love it so much that you’ve done exactly what you’ve done to bring you here today.

The story of Australia Day is the story of a country that is always trying to do better, that understands its past, it understands its failures and it understands how it has achieved its successes. No country is perfect. We’re not, but we have a lot to celebrate and we’re celebrating that in all of you and your contributions today. Our national story is one of good-hearted people making the best possible choices that we can, always striving to be better. You embody that. You’ve had a go. You’ve taken risks, you’ve suffered great setbacks. You’ve dealt with very difficult challenges in your lives, many of you and the most tragic and saddening of circumstances. But you’ve all gotten up, you’ve all risen up, you’ve all faced those challenges. Success in life is never linear, it’s always a result of struggle. It’s the resilience that comes from that struggle and learning from those failures and successes, that have brought you here today. In that, you are exemplars, demonstrating the power of a life dedicated to something bigger than each and every one of us individually.

I am very grateful for that spirit of generosity that you have demonstrated in each of your lives and I particularly want to thank the support people here today; wives, husbands, mums, kids, grandmas, whoever is here I want to thank you for the support that you’ve given those award recipients here today. They know better than anyone that those who are being honoured here today could not be standing here without your love and support and sharing their passion.

In politics it’s often said that we are the volunteers and our family are the conscripts. I’m sure that’s often the case in your service. But in your case also, you know that love and support and I’m pleased that you can come and share this with your family and your friends today.

So thank you for turning your own mistakes and your own misfortunes and struggles, turning that into making Australia stronger and better. So I honour you all. I particularly want to welcome today those who have been serving in these roles for the past year. I want to start by acknowledging Professor Michelle Simmons who is here with us today. I’ve had the opportunity to meet her on numerous occasions both in my former role as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister. Michelle’s work in quantum computing is opening new worlds. Not just for Australia, but the world and where we go as a world and our opportunities into the future. It’s incredibly exciting stuff. I don’t understand it.

[Laughter]

I’ve tried, I’ve got a pretty good idea of what it’s trying to achieve, which is the important thing. But so long as you do, I know we’ll get there.

[Laughter]

This time last year she was whispering to herself; “What on earth am I doing here?”I see a few nods of understanding today. She didn’t see then what we see; leadership, brilliance and above all, service. She’s got a pretty good sense of humour too. Service to science, to advancing our human cause and our nation. This past year, she has travelled right across our country, speaking to schoolkids about the wonders of science and seeing them just light up before her, as she opens their worlds to new possibilities.

She wasn’t the only scientist that we acknowledged last year, our 2018 Senior Australian of the year Dr. Graham Farquhar is also here. Graham, I want to thank you also for the great job you’ve done and your life of service, again. Graham, as you know, is a biophysicist who is helping reshape our understanding of photosynthesis.

I also want to acknowledge our young Australian of the Year Samantha Kerr, one of Australia’s great women’s soccer players. It’s so good isn’t it Samantha, to see the rise of women’s sport in this country? We’ve got our first women’s AFL umpire here today who has been recognised and when we were down there last Sunday with Jen and the girls, seeing Ash Barty play her way into the quarter final, it was not surprising that when we met Ash’s mum and dad, and groundedness she had, this is what is seeing, I think, the great success of Australian women’s sport. We want to see that go forward, so thank you Samantha for your year of service.

And of course, Local Hero and mathematician, teacher – sometime tutor to myself at various functions - Eddie Woo. Thank you Eddie again. Like most dads, it takes a lot for me to impress my kids. But when I told them I was meeting Eddie – and other kids around the country - they thought that was not bad.

[Laughter]

It was great to join you on Instagram and Facebook, social media and all of those things and hopefully I pass the test mate. What you’ve been able to do to enliven young minds to the wonder of mathematics and learning and to do it in such an exciting and accessible way, that’s what we need. It just shows that it is teachers that make the difference, because they’re people and they relate and they connect and you do that so well Eddie. I know you’ll keep doing it as you move on from this wonderful recognition that you’ve had.

So to our winners in past years and to our nominees this year, I want to thank you for everything you do for your country. I want to thank you, that you’ve done it for Australia and that we’ve joined today, Australians all, to celebrate the achievements of a nation, but in particular the contribution of you who are with us today.

So all the best for tonight’s announcements. It may surprise some outside of this place – you all know – but these awards are determined by the Australia Day Council, by Danni and her team. They don’t bring in a list and put it on my desk and say: “Prime Minister can you pick one please?” That’d be fun and I’d have a view I suspect, but that’s not how it works. This is an independent process, this is about Australians recognising Australians and to ensure we recongise the best in Australians.

I know you won’t consider yourselves as ‘winners’, because that’s not how you see your contribution. You just see it as service and that is a truly tremendous thing. I think that’s what we celebrate above all. So thank you all for being here today, it’s great to host you and it will be good to get around and have a chat to you.

I thank you again, for your wonderful efforts to make Australia even stronger.

Thank you.

[Applause]



INTERVIEW, HIT 103.5 CAIRNS

PRESENTER: ScoMo, how are you?

PRIME MINISTER: Good, Shad and Carly, it’s great to be back here and with you guys again today. We’ve had a great couple of days up here in Far North Queensland and thanks to all those who gave us such a warm welcome.

PRESENTER: Now more importantly, how is the first pup, Buddy, doing?

PRIME MINISTER: Buddy is doing great, he has made a number of appearances. When we had the Australian and Indian cricket teams around on New Year's Day, he took to howling every time Kohli spoke and he got himself on the news that night. But he was quite a hit with the entire Indian cricket team, I’ve got to say, as he was with the Aussies. Buddy is doing great.

PRESENTER: Can we chuck him on the team, because I think we’re struggling a little bit out in the field.

PRIME MINISTER: He’s a pretty good fielder, he gets after those quick ones towards the boundary I think. Very, very fast.

PRESENTER: Now, you’re also here for a big announcement around Cooktown and Captain Cook’s voyage around Australia. ScoMo, what is going on?

PRIME MINISTER: It’s an important part of our history and up in Cooktown, they’ll tell you all about it. I mean, if you go back to that day when they called him the ‘little old man” who came out of the bushes with the rest of his mates and they reconciled with Cook over a dispute that they’d had, it’s a beautiful story. And these stories are important about reconciliation in Australia, and they’ve been doing this in Cooktown for 60 years. So the voyage that will go up along the east coast of Australia, which is what Cook did obviously, so there’s a re-enactment element to that and Captain Cook is a big part of that, he’s a big part of the far north coast and Far North Queensland. It’s a big part of our tourism sector as well and I want to see those stories told. I’m proud of Australia’s history. I see Bill Shorten is out there today, he is sneering at Australia’s history today. This is the problem, he sneers from behind his...

PRESENTER: Can I just be honest here, ScoMo. I was questioning whether this Government’s priorities lie, because as a woman in this country living through a domestic violence epidemic, coming fresh off the back of the latest horrific crime that has happened against a woman, I was waiting to hear kind of the next move on that and then this kind of come out of left field. You know, then we’ve got what’s happening down you know in New South Wales with the Murray Darling and this just seemed to come out of left field and a lot of people were going where is this Government’s head at, why is this funding going towards this when we have way more pressing issues going on in this country?

PRIME MINISTER: We can do more than one thing at a time. We’re investing...

PRESENTER: I understand that, but it’s priorities.

PRIME MINISTER: $350 million to combat domestic violence. That’s what we’re doing on domestic violence. Almost half a billion dollars to invest in the Reef, we’ve announced further work that we’re doing on the Murray Darling Basin. All these things are happening at the same time. But focus on the things that matter Carly, and it’s good for you to raise the things that do matter.

PRESENTER: Well I hope so, because we want to keep you accountable, we are all voters.

PRIME MINISTER: Sure.

PRESENTER: And as a woman in this country, as a woman that watches these news reports time and time again, I just hope that this epidemic is really being taken seriously.

PRIME MINISTER: We have had three national action plans now on countering domestic violence in Australia. That’s been $350 million, we’re going to announce the fourth one. Now I was down in Melbourne on the weekend and I took my daughters and my wife and we went along and we went to the memorial for Aiia down there - I know there has also been a terrible murder here up in Far North Queensland as well - and I met Aiia’s father. I reached out to him and we had a private meeting that afternoon and, you know, as one dad to another, what do you say? I’m a father of two girls. The women of my life have been everything in my life and I fear for them as well, but in these horrific attacks, they start with disrespect of women. Disrespect of women doesn’t always, as Malcolm Turnbull used to say, doesn’t always end in that violence but it’s certainly where it starts. And that’s why respect for women is incredibly important and that’s why we’ll continue to invest in domestic violence initiatives and I really don’t want to see that issue - I’m not suggesting you are saying this, either - I don’t want to see that politicised at all. Because there is, I think, a bipartisan commitment to address domestic violence in this country. I don’t question any other MP’s commitment to that and I would be very disappointed if any other MP did likewise to another.

PRESENTER: Well, now we’ve covered the big topics, that got a lot more heated. Can we do the fun now? Let’s have some fun, ScoMo.

[Inaudible]

What I want to know is, and we were having a discussion about this in the office, what’s the toilet situation for MPs? Is there like a big group urinal area? You’re the PM, does Malcolm give you the keys to the fancy throne? What’s the sitch?

PRIME MINISTER: Well there is one in every MPs office.

PRESENTER: So they’ve all got their own?

PRIME MINISTER: They do.

PRESENTER: So there’s no joint urinal?

PRIME MINISTER: Well if you’re walking around the building, yeah there are those as well. And you can often have a quiet conservation.

PRESENTER: Is that where some of the secrets are all done?

PRIME MINISTER: There’s often the odd chat.

PRESENTER: Do you ever look?

[Laughter]

PRIME MINISTER: No.

PRESENTER: Oh everyone has had a look?

PRIME MINISTER: No, no.

PRESENTER: Just a peek, just a little, even an accidental look.

PRIME MINISTER: I think you’re sort of self-revealing there, mate.

PRESENTER: Has anyone ever looked at you?

PRIME MINISTER: I hope not.

[Laughter]

PRESENTER: What about Bill Shorten, have you ever...

[Laughter]

PRIME MINISTER: No, we’ve never actually found ourselves in that situation to the best of my recollection. He’s probably as thankful for that as me.

PRESENTER: Because if you were yelling at each other across the thing and you know, it’s kind of like, it almost gives you a little bit of a prop up doesn’t it?

It’s the ultimate political move, the ultimate power play.

PRIME MINISTER: I think we’ve got to keep you out of Parliament House.

[Laughter]

And if you do see Shad, cover up.

PRESENTER: If you see me walking the halls of Canberra, I’m having a look. Go to the cubicle.

I do often wonder this, about you and Bill, because obviously you’re both doing a job and obviously that job requires you to be constantly in this debate against each other. But is that a personal thing? Would you have… if he invited you around for a barbeque, would you accept the invite?

PRIME MINISTER: Oh look, Bill and I, many years ago, before we were in politics, we travelled to Israel together on a joint delegation.

PRESENTER: Really?

PRIME MINISTER: Many years ago. And there are some pretty embarrassing photos of, you know...

PRESENTER: Got a bit loose, did you?

PRIME MINISTER: Ah no, more because we were… our wardrobes back then were a little different to what they are today.

[Laughter]

PRESENTER: And we both had a bit of a tease of each other about that. But look, politics is a serious business and you respect people professionally. Doctors disagree with each other, lawyers disagree with each other. Professional respect is always important/.

PRIME MINISTER: So would you go to the barbeque?

PRESENTER: I mean, Chloe and Jenny get on quite well, actually, because they’re conscripts to what Bill and I do.

PRESENTER: My last question for you - might have more after that though - is there a red phone in your office that you’re afraid if it rings?

[Laughter]

PRIME MINISTER: No there’s not.

PRESENTER: There’s no such thing as that?

PRIME MINISTER: There’s not. There’s one phone, and it’s this one, and it rings all the time.

[Laughter]

But you know, if Jen’s name comes up, obviously, or the girls - well they don’t have phones - but if Jen’s phone comes up, that’s the one that gets answered.

PRESENTER: That’s the one you answer straight away.

PRIME MINISTER: Not all the time, I’ve got to say, on occasion I have… that’s been raised with me on occasion.

[Laughter]

PRESENTER: Well ScoMo, it’s been a pleasure having you in the studio this morning.

PRIME MINISTER: Thanks guys.

PRESENTER: Good luck with running the country.

PRIME MINISTER: Well look, we’re getting stuff done, the economy is going well, but there is a lot of… you know, this year is going to be a tough year in the economy, so we can’t take this stuff for granted. And that’s my number one priority, because it pays for everything else.

PRESENTER: 100 per cent. Well don’t forget, make sure some of that money keeps coming up here.

[Laughter]

PRIME MINISTER: Well as you can see, Entschy has nailed that for a long time.

PRESENTER: He kills it, he is a very tall human being as well. He intimidates me every time he steps into studio. Alright, thanks.

PRIME MINISTER: Good on you, thanks Shad, thanks Carly.
