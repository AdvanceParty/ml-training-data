      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " Yeah, we were at Sporties last night with Johnsy who cleaned me up on the pool table, he’s a bit of a local legend there as I understand. It was great to spend some time there last night, just chatting with people with Bridget Archer, our Liberal candidate here in Bass."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " Well, when you’re in deficit your debt goes up and it has taken us the last 6 years to get the Budget out of deficit and get it back into surplus. I mean that was the legacy the Labor Party they left us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",
      "value": " Prime Minister in saying that, in the polls it shows  if an election was held now you’d be wiped out. The only shining light is your popularity, obviously  over Bill Shorten as preferred Prime Minister."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " Well I think it’s pretty clear since we’ve come to Government, we’ve got the Budget  back into surplus. We’ve reduced unemployment to levels we’ve not seen in a decade."

    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",

      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",
      "value": " These funds will only be available for people wanting to go into specific skills, it won’t be for all trades?"

    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " The Skilling Australians Fund – Michaelia might want to speak to this as well – that is already funding the additional training arrangements for the traditional skills and things like that. On top of that, we also have the apprenticeship program we announced, the half a billion dollar skills package in the Budget last week, which goes to a range of different apprenticeships which will also, I think, be of great input here in Tasmania."

    },

      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " That’s the same answer to the question that was just put. We would not be doing the business case and putting investment into the Marinus Link project if we had no intention of then following through with a positive result."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " Well I’ve spoken with Peter Dutton about this and there are no issues here that trouble me at all. I mean there’s no suggestion that Peter, in any way shape or form, has a sought or been provided with any benefit here."
    },

      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",
      "value": " Was the Environment Minister ever pressured to get those Adani agreements done, will this free you up in your decision to call the election? And you’re a religious man, does Easter factor into any plans for an election date?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " Let me say a couple of things about the last issue. On Easter Sunday and on Easter Friday and on Anzac Day, the Liberal and National parties won’t be running any political advertisements if we’re in an election campaign at that time."

      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",

      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",

    },

      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",
      "value": " Okay, the reaction to the Budget seems to be pretty positive, but there's a couple of things that I wanted to jump into that aren’t as obvious a headline to everyone else. I think that regardless of who is Prime Minister or what Party is in power, I love that we live in a country that yesterday made a decision that leukemia drugs shouldn't cost $140,000, they should only cost $40."
    },
    { "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER", "value": " Yeah, or even less on a concession that's right, $6.50." },
    {
      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " I mean last year when we did the Budget - I think I remember talking about spinal muscular atrophy and how that's changing the lives of young Australians and their parents - the letters I've had, the stories I've heard, I mean Greg Hunt has the best job in the world I think as the Health Minister to be able to make these changes. But I got to say the other one that I felt very strongly about and I put at the top of the list for what we had to do in this year's Budget, that was our $461 million investment in tackling youth suicide and youth mental health."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",
      "value": " That’s it, clusters of as you say, clusters of teenagers, kids as young as 12 and even younger. The fact that you are so hopeless."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " They decide not to live, that seems to them the right option for you. Now there's mental illness that's attached to that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",
      "value": " One of the knocks that seems to be coming from the obvious sections of the media, most likely informed by your political opponents, is the only way you get to surplus is because somehow you're skimping on the NDIS. I'm assuming this is something you believe not to be true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " Well, it's a lie and it's a stupid lie. Look, there's a reason why Labor clearly haven't been able to deliver a surplus since I had long curly hair and I understand Josh had a mullet."
    },
    { "speaker": "INTERVIEWER", "value": " And I was thin." },
    { "speaker": "ATMOS", "value": "[Laughter]" },
    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " It’s because they don't even know how Budgets work. The NDIS is fully funded."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",
      "value": " But do you care that something as clearly inaccurate as that, takes hold in the media as quickly as it does? It frankly flushes out the people that, it wouldn’t matter if you gave people $100,000, they still would have found a way to say; “Terrible Budget, they're on their way out”"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " Well, I mean if that's what the Labor Party have to rely on - and I thought their response today to the Budget was the most feeble I've seen in a long time. If that's all they could talk about, some concocted story like that which was misusing politically the National Disability Insurance Scheme which is supposed to be a bipartisan initiative - if that's how desperate they are, well I think that reflects very poorly on them and anyone else who was suckered by it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",
      "value": " A lot of people watching us are involved in small business. This is going to be one of the big fights of the election, not just about the impact of minimum wage changes, but most importantly for one of the big boosts - and you could feel it a few years ago when the Government did it - which was the asset write off."
    },
    { "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER", "value": " Yep." },
    {
      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",
      "value": " The fact that even more companies will now be able to claim up to $30,000, This means you get to, people reinvest in their business and now they get to keep even more of their own money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " Well that's how the economy grows; small and family businesses employ people, they invest, they develop new products, they open new stores. They buy a new coffee machine, they buy new fridge, they get a new toolmaking unit or whatever it is."
    },
    { "speaker": "INTERVIEWER", "value": " Good luck with that. " },
    { "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER", "value": " Yeah, good luck with that." },
    {
      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",
      "value": " So this is the thing; the commentariat, the polls whatever, we all know the game that exists now. But isn't it interesting that when the NSW election was 50/50 in the polls, the media covered it in a completely different fashion that meant Michael Daly blew himself up in the last week, it mattered."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " No I don't think – increasingly - that people do think that it’s clear. I think as we get closer to the election, the issues will be come into sharper focus."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",
      "value": " To those people that, either in the past have strayed, or find it hard to go as hard as they may have in previous years, what do you say not to the paid-up and proud members of the Liberal Party, but the person who has voted more than not for the Liberal Party, about why they should fight just as hard in the next couple of months, as they did six years ago?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",

    {
      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " No, it'll just be done when we know who the nominees are, because we learned this; we've had people with very extreme views pop up in all sorts of seats. So you know, let's just wait to see who nominates and then we'll make the decision in the normal way."

      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",

      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",

      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",
      "value": " Because I don't think it helps Neil, for us to just get into this slanging match between all of the personalities here. What happened last Friday was abominable and I think the right response in relation to that, is not to get into tit-for-tat between political parties and start with; “This person is this”, or “that person is that” and “they’re to blame for this” and “they're to blame for that”."

    {
      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",

      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",
      "value": " The reason I did raise it by the way, is Kevin Rudd has tweeted; “It's appalling that Morrison,” you, “can't simply state Liberals and Nationals, put One Nation last. Hanson’s racism and religious bigotry is as clear as day."

      "speaker": "PRIME MINISTER",

If that's the case, then you really need the left of your party to stay on board with you, don't you? Instead, you have key unions reportedly this morning threatening to withdraw financial support because you continue to support, for example, the TPP."

    {
      "speaker": "SHORTEN",
      "value": " Well all the research and science and experts make it clear that the more early years learning we can give our kids before they go to school, it just absolutely, quantum improves their learning experience at schools. So Labor has made a decision that we want to offer universal preschool, 15 hours a week, 40 weeks of the year, to all three and four year olds in Australia."

      "speaker": "SHORTEN",
      "value": " Well, we've been doing a lot of hard work in the last five years as a united and stable opposition. We're not willing to face the next election and just rely on the Government's mistakes to get us across the line, our democratic system is too important."
    },
    {

      "value": " But just paying for it though, where are you going to get the money?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORTEN",
      "value": " Well we are winding back the negative gearing tax concessions on future houses and we are also making other changes to the system of taxation, which will see that some tax concessions which are given to the top end won't be so generous in the future, and instead we're going to use that money to educate the next generation of Australians."
    },
    { "speaker": "INTERVIEWER", "value": " What will happen to the housing market if you do that?" },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORTEN",
      "value": " Well, first of all, we have said that if you currently negatively gear, you will keep negative gearing. So it has no change to any Australian watching this show today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORTEN",
      "value": " No, not at all. Did you know Karl that since they have got into power they have doubled the national debt? And what we have also seen is that they've had deficit upon deficit."

    { "speaker": "INTERVIEWER", "value": " When was the last time Labor had a surplus, in government?" },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORTEN",
      "value": " Oh back in the 80s mate, but neither government has managed to produce a surplus - the Coalition hasn't managed to produce a surplus since they've been in power this time around."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORTEN",
      "value": " We do think that Western Australia has had a bad deal in the past, but we've got to make sure that if we legislate to give a better deal to Western Australia, which is what Labor has called for, that we just make sure that no other state is worse off. I think it's very important that Mr Morrison doesn't rush this, what we've got to do is make sure Western Australia gets a proper deal but no other state should be worse off."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",
      "value": " Okay, despite Labor being well in front, Scott Morrison is selling a better story at the moment isn't he? He's miles in front of you personally on personal approval ratings. Do you worry about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORTEN",
      "value": " Well I don't think this country is getting a better deal from the third Liberal Prime Minister in five years. I don't think they do have a clear plan except to respond to events."
    },

      "speaker": "INTERVIEWER",

      "speaker": "SHORTEN",
      "value": " Yeah, I was with the Australian Workers Union, I was the Victorian Secretary and I was involved in trying to protect the workforce from the unfair blame of the company and trying to make sense of what had happened. And I met some fabulous local workforce at Longford, some have passed, but some I hope to see today at Longford."

    },

      "speaker": "SHORTEN",

Do you support those comments?"

      "value": " Well, I think that there's been a lot of developments, hasn't there? This is not just Labor saying there's a cloud over the eligibility of a senior minister - it's now Malcolm Turnbull, it's now Julie Bishop. The Solicitor-General's advice that the Government relies upon, says that it thinks that it is the better position that Mr Dutton's Constitutionally eligible, but it doesn't give a 100 per cent guarantee and having learnt the hard way myself, you're better removing all ambiguity and submitting it to the High Court."
    },

      "value": " Well, I think Mr Porter's problem is that the Prime Minister who he supported for the last three years say's there a problem and for the sake of certainty, you're best off referring it to the High Court. "

The Solicitor-General is saying that, listen, they think that Minister Dutton is okay, but I wouldn't want to be trying to get a bank loan based on the certainty of that advice of the Solicitor General."

      "speaker": "SHORTEN",
      "value": " What we want to do, and we think, without question, the preferred position will be to refer it off to the High Court - let's get resolution. I think that the Australian people hate the fact that the politicians can't guarantee if they're eligible to do their day job."

      "speaker": "SHORTEN",
      "value": " I think there's a lot more water to go under the bridge but the real issue here in terms of Australians and why it matters to the everyday voter, is that you have the Minister for Home Affairs, a very important person, making very important decisions, there shouldn't be any Constitutional cloud over his eligibility to make those decisions, and I think that the Government needs to just clear the issue up."
