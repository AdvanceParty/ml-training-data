INTERVIEWER:  And 900 have come to Australia and that hasn’t seemed to undermine the border protection policy
SHORTEN:  I choose to invest in schools and hospitals, reducing the aged care waiting list, making sure people can get apprenticeships, making sure that we can reduce the out-of-pocket costs in Medicare
PRIME MINISTER:  Lots of members lobby about lots of things. 
INTERVIEWER:  Oh forget him, forget him. 
SHORTEN:  It will be a matter for the legal system to proceed, he should receive the support any other Australian citizens should receive, the matter is going before court so I don't think there is much more I can add
PRIME MINISTER:  In an alternate present-day version of Oakland, black telemarketer Cassius Green discovers a magical key to professional success – which propels him into a macabre universe
INTERVIEWER:  40 Stories.  Twelve Terrorists
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we’ve both always been on that side, for a long time
SHORTEN:  What we have said is that we are going to review the Newstart allowance
INTERVIEWER:  Was it an afterthought?
SHORTEN:  Well he already is and this is the real heart of the issue
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I can't afford to lose any seats anywhere in the country
INTERVIEWER:  OK.  Let’s talk about climate change
SHORTEN:  Well, I want to try and answer -
PRIME MINISTER:  I've already answered that question previously.  We will be determining that at the time of nominations closing, because frankly, there are many candidates for who should go last
INTERVIEWER:  No, no, but let me talk about the future -
PRIME MINISTER:  No.  This is the big lie of what Labor's been saying about their tax plan
SHORTEN: What does that mean, he's not going to assassinate someone? I mean, sorry, but if you want to change the era I think the Liberals need to do some time in opposition to understand how fundamentally people don't like this
INTERVIEWER:  Stop the clock.   
PRIME MINISTER:  Scientist Will Rodman is determined to find a cure for Alzheimer's, the disease which has slowly consumed his father
SHORTEN:  We'll change that when we get into government because I don't agree with that
INTERVIEWER:  We will have to leave it there, Bill Shorten thank you very much
SHORTEN:  Not at all, it depends if you want federal tax money or not
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I look forward to your support and we will be doing it
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, but where is the wages growth going to come from?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I’m not making any statements on that…
SHORTEN:  Jerry, a small-town Minnesota car salesman is bursting at the seams with debt
INTERVIEWER:  Alright, well look we do have a few minutes to talk to you, so if you change your mind, I’m here
PRIME MINISTER:  People won’t have to wait too long to find out.  But obviously, there were three dates, the 11th, 18th and 25th  and those options are now narrowing, so I don’t think people will have to wait too much longer
SHORTEN:  A hotshot Washington criminal lawyer becomes the target of a rogue security executive videotaped in the act of murdering a congressman when the incriminating tape is surreptitiously slipped into his shopping bag by the videographer, who is fleeing the executive's assassins
INTERVIEWER:  But the Howard Government imposed a very big new tax on Australia, the GST, are you saying they weakened the economy?
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s a very customised plan.  We have a plan to keep our economy strong and we have a plan to keep the Tasmanian economy strong
SHORTEN:  I think that putting in a black and white legislation just puts it beyond doubt
INTERVIEWER:  Sure, okay.  So let me just run through some things and perhaps you can help me understand better or explain motives or whatever it might be
SHORTEN:  We can legislate to restore the penalty rates on Sundays and public holidays that have been cut
PRIME MINISTER:  I absolutely didn’t agree with what she did in the Parliament, when she wore the burqa to Parliament
INTERVIEWER:  All pirates must die. 
SHORTEN:  Set in the Depression-era Franklin County, Virginia, a bootlegging gang is threatened by authorities who want a cut of their profits
PRIME MINISTER:  Good on you Neil, cheers mate. 
INTERVIEWER:  So you haven't decided on preferences there either
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.   Because some of those policies were unpopular
SHORTEN:  No.  I have got to say that what concerns me is the waiting list that someone - the waiting time that someone has to get an elective surgery
INTERVIEWER:  Sure. 
SHORTEN:  I have no plans to review the approvals.  But if we want to be fair dinkum, let's be fair dinkum and let's tell the voters the truth here, all of us
PRIME MINISTER:  No, all I’m saying at this stage is that we will never do a preference deal with One Nation and that we will settle those matters at the time of nominations closing, when we know who all the candidates are
INTERVIEWER:  Because the rumor mill runs hot as I'm sure you're aware
SHORTEN:  Well, changing the Constitution is very difficult
PRIME MINISTER:  We are not going to do any preference deals with One Nation
INTERVIEWER:  Well that's true, if they’re a reality. 
SHORTEN:  Yes, we've got to have more diversity in our media, got to hear more voices, can't just be the same old couple of large media companies in Australia
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes. 
INTERVIEWER:  All right, Prime Minister, time is unfortunately against us as always
SHORTEN:  Well there's no doubt that there's lessons federally and you've mentioned a whole range of seats where there was a significant swing to Labor
PRIME MINISTER:  I go to church in Sydney, yeah. 
INTERVIEWER:  Bill, originally the Marriage Act of 1961 had no definition of who could or couldn't get married in Australia
SHORTEN:  give in to the terrorists and sacrifice his family, or risk everything to uphold his principles - and the integrity of the nation
PRIME MINISTER:  Well what if Fraser Anning is running candidates?
INTERVIEWER:  Well, what –
SHORTEN:  I will let the review look at all of those issues, that is a legitimate issue
PRIME MINISTER:  But they don’t. 
INTERVIEWER:  Now, you’re also here for a big announcement around Cooktown and Captain Cook’s voyage around Australia
SHORTEN:  If we want to talk about conflicting positions, let's be even handed here, Leigh
PRIME MINISTER:  And when Kyoto was set Fran, it was set on the basis that you could carry over credits
INTERVIEWER:  Absolutely. 
SHORTEN:  Sorry what was the last bit of your question?
PRIME MINISTER:  Ex-hitman John Wick comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from him
INTERVIEWER:  Because that might cause the house prices to fall even further?
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah he has, we got a response the other night.  I have also written to him again, that letter crossed over on my second because I was very disturbed at the appearance of Hakeem at the hearing the other day
SHORTEN:  Snoopy embarks upon his greatest mission as he and his team take to the skies to pursue their arch-nemesis, while his best pal Charlie Brown begins his own epic quest
INTERVIEWER:  And do you feel emboldened by the result in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne? I guess everywhere in Victoria in relation to your position on climate change and your Emission Reduction Targets and so on, is that reflective of a broader view nationwide? 
PRIME MINISTER:  I'll tell you why it's important.  Because this year's Budget, the year we're currently in, which was the Budget I handed down last year, we have bettered what I said a year ago by around about $10 billion and in the previous year, we did exactly the same thing
SHORTEN:  I'd welcome an overdue look at the aged care sector in Australia
INTERVIEWER:  No, that's not - 
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Kier, it's great to be here in the studio and great to be here in Cairns again
SHORTEN:  Fiscal responsibility is important, I don't accept the Liberal argument that somehow Dan Andrews isn't fiscally responsible, they've made some very strong decisions
INTERVIEWER:  What’s a tip Suse, what’s the tip?
SHORTEN:  Because for the last three years, and indeed six years, we have been united
PRIME MINISTER:  When you're running deficits, obviously your debt continues to increase Leigh, that's why it's so important to get the Budget back into surplus
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, let's start with the business end of things
SHORTEN:  I think there is a bit of a difference there Baz.  First of all, what we are saying is that in workplace relations, just one set of laws
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I think we're not going to sugar-coat to the public the implications of laws passing the Parliament and Waleed, it's important that you don't either
INTERVIEWER:  I was going to ask you that, how are you going to fund it?
SHORTEN:  Well I think that is essentially Mark's judgement, that he doesn't think it is going to happen and he doesn't support it
PRIME MINISTER:  It is a great story and these are the stories we’re looking to be told with this re-enactment of that voyage
INTERVIEWER:  Once upon a time in Nazi occupied France. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I want to make some simple points.   Yes, we know of course we must address climate change and more importantly, we have been
SHORTEN:  Super.  Thank you
INTERVIEWER:  The polls aren't good, you didn't get any real bounce from that offshore processing issue and that was pushed pretty hard
SHORTEN:  Well, prices go up and prices go down.  It really depends if you're trying to buy or sell a house
PRIME MINISTER:  How can it be ‘too little, too late’ when what we’ve put in place means we exceed our targets by 367 million tonnes? Explain that to me
INTERVIEWER:  Well PM, he has already supported it.  Labor have supported it in the Upper House
PRIME MINISTER:  What you've just said. 
SHORTEN:  Well, fair's fair.  In the six years that the current government have been in, Labor has been united
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, thanks for your time. 
PRIME MINISTER:  You too. 
SHORTEN:  Wow.  
INTERVIEWER:  Last night when those payments were announced, or it was actually on the weekend, they weren't going to apply to people on Newstart
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Ben. 
SHORTEN:  Well, let’s go back to this.  When you give a tax credit to someone who is not paying income tax, that is a gift
INTERVIEWER:  Now, you are taking the fight to Labor on the issue of climate and your Party we know has been tearing itself apart on this for years
PRIME MINISTER:  Then when we put that together, it works exactly like we work the Melbourne Airport Rail Link
SHORTEN:  It's not even true so it's not that tough to counter
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, will any elected WA Labor members make their way onto a Government front bench if you win?
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks very much Sabra. 
SHORTEN:  Sure.  But I actually think Sale Secondary College is also important
INTERVIEWER:  He's back. 
SHORTEN:  Cheers. 
PRIME MINISTER:  This is the leader of the Labor Party in New South Wales who was has said Asians are going to take people’s jobs
INTERVIEWER:  No -  
PRIME MINISTER:  We've just increased the payment and for providers
SHORTEN:  You've declined.  I am sorry if you are busy at lunchtime
INTERVIEWER:  Isn’t it scaremongering to say this will keep people off the public waiting list?
PRIME MINISTER:  Ethan and team take on their most impossible mission yet—eradicating 'The Syndicate', an International and highly-skilled rogue organisation committed to destroying the IMF
SHORTEN:  No, what we are able to do is we are prioritising schools and hospitals over creating richer multinationals and more tax minimisers in you know, Caribbean Islands
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  So if suddenly that incentive doesn’t exist, I’ll take my $600,000 and I’ll put it into BHP shares
PRIME MINISTER:  90. 
SHORTEN:  Oh no I don’t accept that, I accept that what we are doing is creating fairness
INTERVIEWER:  And finally we all saw a picture of Shorten during the week making his kids’ lunches which I’m sure he does every day, I’m sure that wasn’t a photo op-
PRIME MINISTER:  No, Jon, none of that is true. 
SHORTEN:  When a young boy makes a wish at a carnival machine to be big—he wakes up the following morning to find that it has been granted and his body has grown older overnight
INTERVIEWER:  Two worlds.  One voice
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no it’s great to be here, thanks for the fun and thanks for the opportunity to-
SHORTEN:  A man struggles with memories of his past, including a wife he cannot remember, in a nightmarish world with no sun and run by beings with telekinetic powers who seek the souls of humans
INTERVIEWER:  What do you mean by ‘common sense’? Are you suggesting that Australians put their travel plans on hold?
SHORTEN:  Well whilst I'm not running for Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, especially as Michael Gunner is doing such a good job, gee the new Gunner Government was left with a lot of problems by the outgoing administration, the CLP-run people
PRIME MINISTER:  Vignettes weaving together the stories of six individuals in the old West at the end of the Civil War
INTERVIEWER:  And the public service.  Now, you made a similar request to Malcolm Turnbull and he was, I think from memory, open-minded about it at the time?
SHORTEN:  A deaf woman is stalked by a psychotic killer in her secluded home
PRIME MINISTER:  The Scorpion King teams up with a female warrior named Tala, who is the sister of The Nubian King
INTERVIEWER:  My last question for you - might have more after that though - is there a red phone in your office that you’re afraid if it rings?
SHORTEN:  Liquidated after discovering a corporate conspiracy, mild-mannered graphic artist Patience Phillips washes up on an island, where she's resurrected and endowed with the prowess of a cat -- and she's eager to use her new skills 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I wanted to see the payment passed through the Parliament and the Labor Party and others, you know, we were aware of the position and I wanted to see passed
INTERVIEWER:  Let the Magic Begin. 
PRIME MINISTER: They sought to solve a problem that didn't exist. 
SHORTEN:  Well, it has caused havoc and some can argue the rule is outmoded but it wouldn't be my immediate priority
INTERVIEWER:  Live or die.  Make your choice
SHORTEN:  Good, that's good.  There you go
PRIME MINISTER:  V A C U U M. 
INTERVIEWER:  I got a few messages today when I promoted the fact that you were going to be calling in, from political journos who said, “Oh look, Scott Morrison kind of dodged a question today about Julie Bishop and when people asked whether or not she was going to run at the next election you said I refer you to her statement
PRIME MINISTER:  No, Jon, what I’ve got is a sensible, practical policy which is based on reducing our emissions, which we need to do and have done, and a plan to keep doing that out to 2030 and meet our targets which will see emissions per capita fall per person by more than 50 percent and our emissions intensity fall by more than two thirds
SHORTEN:  We need to see the final detail.  Anyone who says that they can commit to something that they haven't seen is selling you something which isn't real
INTERVIEWER:  So you won’t change your targets?
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s just what she told you herself.  That’s what she said, that’s what her public statement is and that’s a matter for Julie
SHORTEN:  A couple with a newborn baby face unexpected difficulties after they are forced to live next to a fraternity house
INTERVIEWER:  Malcolm Turnbull called some of the people in the media partisan and thought that they stepped across the mark
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I will say, I don’t care where the power comes from, so long as it’s reliable and it turns up every day…
SHORTEN:  Well, I've got a general rule in life that you’re always better talking than having a standoff
INTERVIEWER:  I want to do something I never thought I would do
PRIME MINISTER:  I want to rule a line under this issue.  It never happened, I’ve always been deeply concerned about attitudes towards people of Muslim faith in our community
SHORTEN:  Kit, a troubled girl, is sent to the exclusive Blackwood boarding school, where she discovers that only four other female students have been admitted to learn the four pillars of knowledge under the ominous wing of the mysterious headmistress Madame Duret
INTERVIEWER: Prime Minister, I did ask my listeners to submit questions
SHORTEN:  There's 250 companies caught by our safeguards mechanism, the same safeguard mechanism the current government applies to 120, each company will respond differently
PRIME MINISTER:  Through a series of daring escapades deep within a dark and dangerous criminal underworld, Han Solo meets his mighty future copilot Chewbacca and encounters the notorious gambler Lando Calrissian
INTERVIEWER:  Are you relieved given a woman was not pre-selected in Stirling
SHORTEN:  In 2019, Lincoln Six-Echo is a resident of a seemingly "Utopian" but contained facility
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, that’s not gonna happen.  I’ve spoken to the Minister this morning, the service will go ahead at dawn as usual
INTERVIEWER:  Jeff Kennett - the oft outspoken Mr Kennett -
SHORTEN:  I just didn’t realise that we had a technophobic government who is afraid of new technology
PRIME MINISTER:  Labor had a lot to say about that, so where is Bill Shorten today? Tanya Plibersek? Anthony Albanese? When it comes to the leader of the Labor Party in the New South Wales Parliament –
INTERVIEWER:  Right. 
PRIME MINISTER:  We work constructively with China.  I've met with [inaudible] as well as the President and we have a very important relationship with China and I'm very positive about particularly the economic growth of China
SHORTEN:  An uproarious version of history that proves nothing is sacred – not even the Roman Empire, the French Revolution and the Spanish Inquisition
INTERVIEWER:  We spoke to numerous people who were involved in drafting the bill, there seems to have been no advice that those people, with those track records, would be able to –
SHORTEN:  All right, good chat.  Thank you
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks, Leigh great to be with you. 
INTERVIEWER:  You have been accused of scaremongering on this issue
PRIME MINISTER:  Not all the time, I’ve got to say, on occasion I have… that’s been raised with me on occasion
SHORTEN:  Well, let's sort out population, cost of living, workers’ rights, build a strong economy to make it work in the interest of everyone - 
INTERVIEWER:  In the Budget though, last night the Treasurer did point out that there were headwinds the economy is facing - the slowdown in the global economy, the housing market is in a slump and forecasts of further house price falls to come?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I have.  So again Waleed, look to the experience that I've laid out for you tonight and don't prejudge me
SHORTEN:  When the girl that detective Joe Hallenback is protecting gets murdered, the boyfriend of the murdered girl attempts to investigate and solve the case
INTERVIEWER:  But it’s the environment with all those other factors-
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes, I did that ages ago. 
SHORTEN:  Babe is a little pig who doesn't quite know his place in the world
INTERVIEWER:  And if the Minister has discretion to stop that person?  
SHORTEN:  A naive young man assumes a dead man's identity and finds himself embroiled in an underground world of power, violence, and chance where men gamble behind closed doors on the lives of other men
PRIME MINISTER:  The little witch is only 127 years old – too young for the annual coven of witches
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  PM, thank you very much for joining us.  I look forward to talking to you on the election campaign
SHORTEN:  The story of British officer T. E
PRIME MINISTER:  Nah, I don’t go a thickshake. 
INTERVIEWER:  But you talk about white collar criminals, and in this case that’s who you are targeting, and yet you oppose an ABCC in the area of industrial criminality
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks mate, cheers.   
SHORTEN:  In terms of the commercial high jump bar, yeah they've passed that
INTERVIEWER:  Bring Him Home. 
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, I understand the frustration of Australians about crowded infrastructure, and our immigration should be what's in the national interest but part of that debate has to be fixing up our infrastructure
PRIME MINISTER:  Well –
INTERVIEWER:  Why are they here?
PRIME MINISTER:  Henri “Papillon” Charrière, a safecracker from the Parisian underworld, is wrongfully convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in the penal colony of French Guiana, where he forges a strong friendship with Louis Dega, a counterfeiter who needs his protection
SHORTEN:  No, I’ll tell you what my Labor colleagues they are adults, they can sign or not
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  What if there was a Saturday night going and I really had to cover an election? The 11th, the 18th, or the 25th?
PRIME MINISTER:  In Stockholm, Sweden, hacker Lisbeth Salander is hired by Frans Balder, a computer engineer, to retrieve a program that he believes it is too dangerous to exist
SHORTEN:  We will have a good look at them.  We have backed 15 sets of changes
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister I’m not suggesting anything.  I’m simply -
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we’ve announced half a billion dollar water infrastructure fund

INTERVIEWER:  You could feed Asia, you could feed Asia, people would willingly live west of the Great Dividing Range and the quality of life if they knew they weren't going to be immersed and surrounded and enveloped by drought
PRIME MINISTER:  What we've done over the last five and a half years is increased funding for hospitals by over 60 per cent
SHORTEN:  Well, that will be up to the people of Australia, but I think our message is one which resonates
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister I know your time is tight this morning and you must go, so one final question
SHORTEN:  Well I made the decision, when they first proposed having the plebiscite I thought it was the wrong process, I thought it was an abdication of leadership but then I thought why on earth should we let some Australians go through this process on their own
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh I don’t really care but so long as they’re safe and they don’t run into people
INTERVIEWER:  [Laughter] I did want to come back to that. 
SHORTEN:  our tax system is making it harder for our young ones, our millennials, the younger people to be able to even buy their first home
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that’s exactly what Labour set out when they announced that they were going there in the first place
INTERVIEWER:  I would say none, which is what the authors of the bill contend
PRIME MINISTER:  And that’s what the process will determine. 
SHORTEN:  We had a bus long before Scott had it, and we've even been on the bus!
INTERVIEWER:  I was under the impression that you would be voting against the bill
SHORTEN:  No.  Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand, the Labour Prime Minister there, went to a series of countries on provisions which a conservative government had signed up to, and executed letters with those countries and both countries agreed not to go ahead with that
PRIME MINISTER:  Well this is right.  In cases when you take in all the benefits and so on, you can have cases of people earning up to 80,000 a year and they pay no net tax
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  But you’re –
PRIME MINISTER:  We established the Skilling Australians Fund last year Jon, that was in last year's Budget
SHORTEN:  Well, we'd have to see the numbers and decide if we wanted to do that
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Bringing the children of terrorists here is a risk, isn't it?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well our commodity price forecasts for example are well below, right now, what the price is

INTERVIEWER: Yes. 
SHORTEN:  Set in Las Vegas, the film centers on a man who attends his best friend's bachelor party, unaware of an insidious agenda that plays into hunting humans
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s a mystery Ben.

PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t think you believe that’s true either. 
SHORTEN:  "Dirty" Harry Callahan is a San Francisco Police Inspector on the trail of a group of rogue cops who have taken justice into their own hands
INTERVIEWER:  The bloke’s in jail. 
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, the issue of climate change has been getting away from Australia for the last ten years
PRIME MINISTER:  Well who?
INTERVIEWER:  So, I fully –
SHORTEN:  Yes, Labor believes that we need to fund more preschool
PRIME MINISTER:  You mean particularly after Friday?
[Advertisement/traffic advice/music break]
INTERVIEWER:  We've been there before.  
SHORTEN:  Well we are going to review it.  First things first - I do think Newstart is too low
PRIME MINISTER:  I’ve been in the job for just over six months, one of the first thing that it was we we got this dam project underway up in Hughenden
INTERVIEWER: But you’re talking about a preference deal, which is not what I’m talking about
PRIME MINISTER:  No worries. 
SHORTEN:  Using a special camera that can see spirits, a family must protect their daughter from an evil entity with a sinister plan
INTERVIEWER:  It’s a carbon price. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Why? Because they wanted to encourage countries to overachieve…
SHORTEN:  There's a point of difference but not the one he's claiming to make
INTERVIEWER:  Can we chuck him on the team, because I think we’re struggling a little bit out in the field
PRIME MINISTER:  I think it's rubbish. 
SHORTEN:  Pakistan-born comedian Kumail Nanjiani and grad student Emily Gardner fall in love but struggle as their cultures clash

SHORTEN:  Fletcher Reede is a fast-talking attorney and habitual liar

INTERVIEWER:  You are aren't spending too much already are you?
SHORTEN:  It'll be great.  Long overdue
PRIME MINISTER:  Well not under our laws, but they can under Labor's
INTERVIEWER:  I feel like it’s very difficult to get through a sentence at the moment
SHORTEN:  Well, between five to six years, we've seen the recoup in the solar panels
PRIME MINISTER:  Mt.  Doom, the only place where it can be destroyed
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  But are you going to throw any money in there to restore and rehabilitate these people?
PRIME MINISTER:  So how can they be providing more tax relief when they’re actually halving the amount of tax relief that is currently legislated before the Parliament?
SHORTEN:  The parents of a soon-to-be married couple make the final preparations for the wedding ceremony
INTERVIEWER:  Same Planet.  New Scum
SHORTEN:  A young man struggles to access sublimated childhood memories
PRIME MINISTER:  I agree.  And when this matter was brought to my attention, I dealt with it
INTERVIEWER:  Okay and you –
SHORTEN:  Of course we want people to get off the dole and get a job
PRIME MINISTER:  And in comes the big dark hand of Labor to rip it out of your pockets
INTERVIEWER:  Only Brisbane at this stage. 
SHORTEN:  Yeah, okay. 
PRIME MINISTER:  [Laughter] I think that’s great too. 
INTERVIEWER:  When does that start?
PRIME MINISTER:  There’s been no reduction in funding.  I mean we asked the ABC to actually do the same thing that every single Department and agency has to do in terms of an efficiency dividend, which they weren’t required to do for years and years and years
SHORTEN:  Who gets on the front bench is ultimately decided by the Caucus
INTERVIEWER:  You’ve got to tell us, do you own a Burberry trench coat at this point, and if you do, I’d get rid of it very quickly

INTERVIEWER:  On breast cancer I just want to raise for our listeners
SHORTEN:  Lucky Luke becomes the Sheriff of Daisy Town and runs out all the criminals
PRIME MINISTER:  Against his father Odin's will, The Mighty Thor - a powerful but arrogant warrior god - recklessly reignites an ancient war
INTERVIEWER:  You've come up with a recommendation of your own around the new protections for whistleblowers but it’s this financial incentive that’s thrown in as well
SHORTEN:  Okay sure. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I am saying we have a clear plan based on a great track record of which Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott were key parts of putting together and driving that success
INTERVIEWER:  He's no worry to you.  Just tomorrow though, are you going to be undermined in a way because - unless you've got a bit of an insight, I'm sure as Prime Minister you most probably have - because these net overseas migration figures come out tomorrow
SHORTEN:  Well, you made a preamble to this question.  I have answered questions on climate change many times, many times
PRIME MINISTER:  In the dark heart of a sprawling, anonymous city, two assassins carry out a sinister mission, a teacher battles a fatal illness, and an enigmatic janitor and a curious waitress lead dangerous double lives

INTERVIEWER:  Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire. 
PRIME MINISTER:  This is so important and we're changing when you set the threshold as well
SHORTEN:  I've spoken to him a few times.  But I notice the conspiracy of the far right against Malcolm Turnbull
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Have you got little lights you can put on your car so you can come roaring down the middle of the road?
SHORTEN:  After watching their respective partners die, a cop and a hitman form an alliance in order to bring down their common enemy
PRIME MINISTER:  I’ve got another tough Western Australian behind me and they just stay focused on what their job is and what their responsibilities and their accountabilities are
INTERVIEWER:  None at all?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's a terrible lie, Jon. 
SHORTEN:  extortion.  To achieve his goal, he recruits musclemen Paul and Adrian as accomplices
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  The park is open. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, Leigh, I mean, just as well I’m a fighter when you listen to what you’ve just relayed out there which is I think is a particularly pessimistic way to look at things
SHORTEN:  A young boy whose parents just divorced finds an unlikely friend and mentor in the misanthropic, bawdy, hedonistic, war veteran who lives next door
INTERVIEWER:  Well I mean that's what we're meant to do, that's what we stand there and do you know?

INTERVIEWER:  The search begins. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's why you need your economy to be strong and the only people are going to get a wage rise under Bill Shorten are the people smugglers
SHORTEN: Absolutely we do, and I certainly think the decision -  because it should be for the new government whoever they are, Liberal or Labor 
INTERVIEWER:  You’re dead right.  Dead right
SHORTEN: I think, Fran, is this the way we want immigration laws and strong borders being made by people whose constitutional eligibility has a cloud over it? 
PRIME MINISTER:  But the Tax Office – if the Labor Party says they support our tax cuts, then the Tax Office can administer it on that basis
INTERVIEWER:  Coal, you mean. 
SHORTEN:  the fabled Bracelet of Anubis.  Unfortunately, a newly resurrected Imhotep has designs on the bracelet as well, and isn’t above kidnapping its new bearer, Alex, to gain control of Anubis’s otherworldly army
PRIME MINISTER:  Lara Croft, the fiercely independent daughter of a missing adventurer, must push herself beyond her limits when she finds herself on the island where her father disappeared
INTERVIEWER:  I want to take you to another matter basically it’s self-interest, but we are talking about the future of our port at Trinity Inlet
PRIME MINISTER:  Well again, whatever we might say would be a matter that I would consult with the National Security Committee of Cabinet
SHORTEN:  I think you just said earlier on that it was just, in very recent moments, that Tanya made that comment so, I haven't seen them
INTERVIEWER:  And Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten joins us now from Queensland's Sunshine Coast
PRIME MINISTER:  My last advice on all of those of whom there were some serious concerns on character issues, I think was over about 50
SHORTEN:  Kevin McCallister's parents have split up.  Now living with his mom, he decides to spend Christmas with his dad at the mansion of his father's rich girlfriend, Natalie
INTERVIEWER:  Because if I'm wrong, if I am wrong and it's the core of your government is not about taxing wealthy people to redistribute income to lower incomes, in a sentence, what is going to be the core of the Shorten Labor Government?
SHORTEN:  Well Mr Morrison will have to call an election in the next five months, they have to
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, it’s going to depend on people’s holding.  But it’s going to be a hell of a lot lower than they’re paying right now
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  He has after he got caught. 
SHORTEN:  We can afford to do this because we are making the tough economic decisions
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t know what he was talking about. 
INTERVIEWER:  Just finally, Married At First Sight sadly beat the Budget in ratings last night
SHORTEN:  We need an independent national broadcaster.   
PRIME MINISTER:  The real choice is who is going to be the Prime Minister after the next election
INTERVIEWER:  So this comes without a budget allocation yet?
SHORTEN:  Thank you.  In terms of the treatment of the children on Nauru, I have been watching very carefully what the AMA have been saying
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s exactly what happens, that’s exactly what happens
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister Good morning, if we are to meet our Paris targets in a canter as you have repeatedly promised why do we need to spend another $3
SHORTEN:  Well I tell you what the numbers on me were the same before the State Election as they are now, but we’re doing pretty well
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I think it’s important to continue the Dawn Service in the way it’s been done
INTERVIEWER:  And implement a policy –
SHORTEN:  First of all, the election hasn't been held. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t think it would get you from Northies to North Cronulla, I don’t think it’d get you that far
INTERVIEWER:  Well you are the leaders of the country and we do look towards Canberra to lead us and thank you for standing up and doing it
SHORTEN:  Yes, let's do that, Leigh.  That would be great
PRIME MINISTER:  I'm sorry, this is his own Party. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Don't Miss the Climax. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m committed to winning the next election, and in the Liberal Party…
SHORTEN:  The Coast Guard makes a daring rescue attempt off the coast of Cape Cod after a pair of oil tankers are destroyed during a blizzard in 1952
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten on the question of tax cuts, there's a report in newspapers this morning suggesting that Labor has taken a decision not to offer additional tax cuts for people on incomes between $90,000 and $120,000 or $125,000 a year
PRIME MINISTER:  They do. 
SHORTEN:  Oh, two questions, OK. 
INTERVIEWER:  No. 
SHORTEN:  Yeah you're right, we did want to see it but the problem is Mr Turnbull couldn't even bring it to the Parliament and we encouraged him to, we thought this was a good thing to do but this is the big problem in Australia and I didn't want to talk too much about my opponents
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I mean if that's what the Labor Party have to rely on - and I thought their response today to the Budget was the most feeble I've seen in a long time
INTERVIEWER:  A deadly tool. 
SHORTEN:  Well, but are they Jon when you think about the issue that Australians haven't voted for Scott Morrison
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, or even less on a concession that's right, $6
INTERVIEWER:  Is it right Bill Shorten has written to you advising the Opposition front bench will be having meeting with senior public servants in the next couple of weeks to ensure a smooth transition of power?
PRIME MINISTER:  In your commentary on these things, all journalists I think, have to be careful that they don't create a false impression of the risks that need to be managed
SHORTEN:  I think that we can miss out on what's happening around the world, you know climate change and the investment in renewables is one example but I think your question is going to a deeper point
INTERVIEWER:  Do you know - I don’t know how old you were in 1988 - but when the big event, the ships around Australia, those beautiful sails when they came into the inlet the place was chock-a-block
SHORTEN:  Well we want the subsidy to go to the parents and what we're going to say to child care operators though is that we don't want them ramping up the prices
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I know what the accusations are.  I was accused of that when the boats were turning up thick and fast when we were in Opposition and people said I wouldn't be able to, as a team, turn it around
INTERVIEWER:  Can I come - no, no, I’ve got to ask you this question
SHORTEN:  Maybe not the lollies.  See you, bye
PRIME MINISTER:  We’re doing all of these things Jon. 
INTERVIEWER:  Is this dependent on the federal election result?
SHORTEN:  The subsidy will be for parents.  If your household income is up to $68,000 we will provide a 100 per cent subsidy up to the capped amount of $11
PRIME MINISTER:  Of course there is.  There's always that
INTERVIEWER:  But hasn't Nauru fixed it now?
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m sure you’ll always be on air, I’m sure your viewers will be demanding that you be on air all the time
SHORTEN:  I certainly don't think the outcome of the next election is at all decided
INTERVIEWER:  Scott Morrison, Prime Minister of Australia, thank you for your time in studio today
SHORTEN:  His unholy sexual passion for his sister, his marriage to Rome's most infamous prostitute, his fiendishly inventive means of disposing those who would oppose him, and more
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I'm not saying at this point, because when I've made that final decision, when I go out to see the Governor-General, that's when that will be public
INTERVIEWER:  Opposition Leader Bill Shorten joins us now from Melbourne
PRIME MINISTER:  An other-worldly story, set against the backdrop of Cold War era America circa 1962, where a mute janitor working at a lab falls in love with an amphibious man being held captive there and devises a plan to help him escape
SHORTEN:  An IRS agent with a fateful secret embarks on an extraordinary journey of redemption by forever changing the lives of seven strangers
INTERVIEWER:  That's already being done.  So basically, this is a heap of humbug
SHORTEN:  So, we're committed to our reforms to make our budget sustainable
PRIME MINISTER:  There’s not.  There’s one phone, and it’s this one, and it rings all the time
INTERVIEWER:  Okay yeah. 
SHORTEN:  The fact that bank said this tells me a couple of things
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, when you’re in deficit your debt goes up and it has taken us the last 6 years to get the Budget out of deficit and get it back into surplus
INTERVIEWER:  He went to Sydney Boys High. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Ben, you are absolutely right.  And mate, I saw those same reports as I’m sure you did over the break and I’m not pleased you’ve raised it for the obvious reasons but I am glad you’ve raised it, if you know what I mean
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, it is just a nonsense claim.  It is a nonsense claim and it is built upon the back of a big lie
INTERVIEWER:  It’s nice to see you down here.  Let me ask you off the top, hey, you’ve really got in and met some of the locals, including I believe one of my favourite places, Sporties last night? Is that true?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I think it’s just fundamental economics 101, Leigh
SHORTEN:  if you want to keep driving a petrol car, you can
INTERVIEWER:  What do you say to the comments from Imre Salusinszky who is the former advisor to the New South Wales Premier Mike Baird, that conservative politicians have a tendency to cave on policy decisions due pressure of broadcasters like Ray Hadley?
SHORTEN:  One thousand years after cataclysmic events forced humanity's escape from Earth, Nova Prime has become mankind's new home
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh I’ve been here all week, I’m heading back down to Sydney tonight
INTERVIEWER:  Which bit?
PRIME MINISTER:  …out of their bottom smear draw because they were under pressure in the Parliament
SHORTEN:  We want to put forward positive views.  Some people say the Government's such a disorganised shambles, just sit back and buy a box of popcorn, but the point is that puts more pressure on us, because people think the system is broken
INTERVIEWER:  Well specifically with monies allocated from the Commonwealth
SHORTEN:  NYPD detectives Christopher Danson (Johnson) and P
PRIME MINISTER:  Captain Glass of the USS “Arkansas” discovers that a coup d'état is taking place in Russia, so he and his crew join an elite group working on the ground to prevent a war
INTERVIEWER:  Now, you have said it’s your job to have a plan for managing our population, we agree with you
SHORTEN:  Batman and Nightwing are forced to team with the Joker's sometimes-girlfriend Harley Quinn to stop a global threat brought about by Poison Ivy and Jason Woodrue, the Floronic Man
PRIME MINISTER:  Given the country's overcrowded prisons, the U. S
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Do we need to be concerned about any similar attacks here? Any extra protection for mosques in particular?
SHORTEN:  In a dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods
PRIME MINISTER:  Hi Deb. 
INTERVIEWER:  I’ve made you late for your next appointment.   I’ve got your staff glaring at me through the glass, I’ll have to let you go
PRIME MINISTER:  One year after outwitting the FBI and winning the public’s adulation with their mind-bending spectacles, the Four Horsemen resurface only to find themselves face to face with a new enemy who enlists them to pull off their most dangerous heist yet
SHORTEN:  A troubled psychologist is sent to investigate the crew of an isolated research station orbiting a bizarre planet
INTERVIEWER:  In search of salvation, he'll make the city rain blood
PRIME MINISTER:  I think that's what the bubble worries about.  But what Australians are going to decide at the next election –
SHORTEN:  Well I don't buy what you are selling there, but I will go to this point, I did say that I don't comment on polls - good or bad, but if Mr Morrison, if he thinks that he is doing really well at the moment go and ask his Victorian colleagues
INTERVIEWER:  The greatest escape adventure ever told. 
SHORTEN:  In a futuristic world where the polar ice caps have melted and made Earth a liquid planet, a beautiful barmaid rescues a mutant seafarer from a floating island prison
PRIME MINISTER:  No, not even the ABC. 
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, really appreciate your time, thank you so much for joining News Breakfast
SHORTEN:  Just hang on, hang on, gentlemen, ladies, we've a fair go at this press conference, perhaps I'll allow one more question and then we got to finish up, we've got to go to Tiwi
PRIME MINISTER:  Great to be back Leigh. 
INTERVIEWER:  Ok. 
SHORTEN:  No, she has strong views.  I like Melissa
PRIME MINISTER:  I would. 
INTERVIEWER:  LNP candidate Gerard Rennick has been caught spreading conspiracy theories about climate change and some curious ideas about your preschool policy
PRIME MINISTER:  Batman raises the stakes in his war on crime.  With the help of Lt
SHORTEN:  We believe that anyone who comes here via people smuggler should be resettled in a third party nation, yes
INTERVIEWER:  Firstly PM, Erdogan, the Turkish President.  Do you have a comment on that?
SHORTEN:  – sure 
PRIME MINISTER:  I think you’re sort of self-revealing there, mate
INTERVIEWER:  So stop, stop.  Yeah so we had to go back because you said pass
SHORTEN:  Ms McGowan has always said she's concerned about all of the people in detention, not just the kids
PRIME MINISTER:  But he's got a thing called Gumnut Designz and they're selling hats to raise money for Sisters of the North which is supporting those local charities up there
INTERVIEWER:  What will happen to the housing market if you do that?
SHORTEN:  It will work cooperatively and constructively.  I always had the view, back from my days representing workers in negotiations with employers, that no one has got a monopoly on having all the good ideas
PRIME MINISTER:  They provided a response and the police have accepted that response and they haven't sought any I'm advised, any further statement
INTERVIEWER:  But I mean I'm worried that the situation.  The US could say these 265 people are not coming here but do they end up in Australia?
PRIME MINISTER:  That is a separate process which continues to be underway which is agnostic about what the source of reliable energy is and that is a separate process
SHORTEN:  Well the franking credits, that's still prospective
INTERVIEWER:  The Prime Minister is also in Queensland at the moment
SHORTEN:  Nada, a wanderer without meaning in his life, discovers a pair of sunglasses capable of showing the world the way it truly is
PRIME MINISTER:  England, early 18th century.  The close relationship between Queen Anne and Sarah Churchill is threatened by the arrival of Sarah's cousin, Abigail Hill, resulting in a bitter rivalry between the two cousins to be the Queen's favourite
INTERVIEWER:  But wasn't there a warning to upgrade the system in 2015, three or four years ago?
SHORTEN:  CIA Analyst Jack Ryan is drawn into an illegal war fought by the US government against a Colombian drug cartel
PRIME MINISTER:  Sure. 
INTERVIEWER:  God Created Man.  Man Created Immortality
PRIME MINISTER:  Well of course it does.  So does reliable energy
SHORTEN:  Well what we want to do is create a level playing field, first of all
INTERVIEWER:  But will your changes to negative gearing mean that houses will be even cheaper?
PRIME MINISTER:  They’ve already voted for it. 
SHORTEN:  OK let's go through each of those three points very briefly
INTERVIEWER:  If people see a direction they're happy and that's what you said, you explain where you're taking us, why you're going and if it's not going to work in 12 months, 2 years, 3 years we reevaluate and move back through
SHORTEN:  Barrie, is this Liberal government, this protection racket for the banks scandals and rip-offs we’ve seen, are they really telling Australians that the only way that we can have a banking sector is to have an unethical banking sector? I don't buy that, nor do thousands of farmers and small businesses and people who have been ripped off by the banks
PRIME MINISTER:  Teddy Walker is a successful salesman whose life takes an unexpected turn when he accidentally blows up his place of employment
INTERVIEWER:  We're in election mode, though, clearly Mr Shorten
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah. 
SHORTEN:  When Russia's first nuclear submarine malfunctions on its maiden voyage, the crew must race to save the ship and prevent a nuclear disaster
INTERVIEWER:  The reason I did raise it by the way, is Kevin Rudd has tweeted; “It's appalling that Morrison,” you, “can't simply state Liberals and Nationals, put One Nation last
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I can, and I'm also fortunate to have people of the calibre of Senator Dodson here and I might give him a run on the ball, but I'll just make this
PRIME MINISTER:  Not only those but also people who had serious character assessments –
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  All right well let's move on to other things but I'm basing my beliefs not on what the Labor Party have briefed us on
PRIME MINISTER:  True. 
SHORTEN:  I think the nation is sick and tired after ten years of arguing about climate change that we just don't get on with it
INTERVIEWER:  ASIO also says the leak on their advice was incorrect and you were in part using that leak publicly to convince us the boats were coming
PRIME MINISTER:  He already is. 
SHORTEN:  It was a big time.  I remember, of course, that two men got killed and another two were badly burnt
INTERVIEWER:  An afterthought. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Waleed, the other night, you were very emotional and I’m sure you may have said some things about me, that based on our conservations since, you think may have been a bit over the top, about my own motives when it comes to these issues
SHORTEN:  No, that wouldn't be right.  What we want to do is have real change, because, frankly, more of the same under this government isn't good enough for Australians -
INTERVIEWER:  Who paid for them?
PRIME MINISTER:  There only needs to be one Waleed, that’s my answer
SHORTEN:  Well no, Fran, what I'm not going to do is engage in that debate
INTERVIEWER:  In the interest of flexibility, like on the Newstart thing, if you do look at it, if you look at it and go; “Alright we're in a pretty strong position as far as finances are concerned, we might be able to do a few more things for people with cancer considering the number of people impacted by it,” you're willing to take a look at that?
SHORTEN:  Well, what we'll do in our way is we’ll put more investment in the Territory
PRIME MINISTER:  Absolutely, as I just said, in the last two budgets we bettered what we said we would do, by $10 billion each year
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, you've come back in the polls.  Is that the message you're getting from the ground, you’re back in the fight?
PRIME MINISTER:  What today is is about a comprehensive plan for Australia's future population growth
SHORTEN:  We will once we have announced all of our policies
INTERVIEWER:  Well those very promises that you just ran off there, that Daniel Andrews was promising, you know spending on schools and hospitals - we heard the Federal Treasurer on AM suggest that obviously the Federal Coalition is going to have to counter that kind of campaign, that kind of spending
PRIME MINISTER:  Once it was drawn to his attention, he paid it back
SHORTEN:  This movie was followed by a sequel (The Japanese Wife Next Door – Part 2) which features the exact same cast, but follows Takashi’s fate if he had married Mina (the other woman he shared the drink with that night) instead
INTERVIEWER:  No one promised them a fair fight. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we did and have been. 
SHORTEN:  Nicky, a veteran con artist, takes a novice named Jess under his wing
INTERVIEWER:  What difference will it make in terms of power supply on the grid?
SHORTEN:  Yes, I understand that linkage.  But what I want to make clear and they are two separate issues
PRIME MINISTER:  No, it’s not.  No, it's their money
INTERVIEWER: So you can just go to the Sydney residence?
SHORTEN:  What we want to do, and we think, without question, the preferred position will be to refer it off to the High Court - let's get resolution
PRIME MINISTER:  What I’m saying, Leigh, is that all Australians who are living here are getting more jobs today than they were before
INTERVIEWER:  Not for the past, hence the surplus. 
PRIME MINISTER:  We have no plans for subsidies at all, no, we don't have such a plan
SHORTEN:  18-year-old Penny Cooper spent years pining for Johnny Sanders Jr
INTERVIEWER:  But just paying for it though, where are you going to get the money?
PRIME MINISTER:  No, this was just a shadow cabinet meeting. 
SHORTEN:  Young Shakespeare is forced to stage his latest comedy, "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter," before it's even written
INTERVIEWER:  Happy Halloween to you this morning.  Are you going trick or treating this arvo with the kids? Maybe you could go around Malcolm's house, he has got plenty of goodies for the government
PRIME MINISTER:  It's going to require a reconstruction plan, property by property
SHORTEN:  Well that's good he went there, I'm not going to complain about that, that's good he went there
INTERVIEWER:  Why else would you be hacking into the Parliament?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well Neil, what I'm not going to do today - which is I think what you're inviting me to do -
SHORTEN:  Yeah no, that’s somewhere with the Burberry trench coat
INTERVIEWER:  Sorry, just while you’re on debt, you’ve been in office now for six years, you point out that Labor had a debt problem
PRIME MINISTER:  I understand that and this will cost hundreds of millions of dollars if not more
SHORTEN:  I tell you what, the last Prime Minister or the last leader who worried about the polls, is probably watching this on iView from New York
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Refuse to Be a Victim. 
PRIME MINISTER:  So no, I wouldn't agree with your rather negative view of our performance
SHORTEN:  we are grandfathering our proposals.  Most people don't know quite what grandfathering means
INTERVIEWER:  And if you doesn't, will you?
SHORTEN:  Six years have elapsed since Guantanamo Bay, leaving Harold and Kumar estranged from one another with very different families, friends and lives
PRIME MINISTER:  A good program should get support, but what we are able to do is fund Medicare to its highest rate of bulk-billing in history without it increasing people's taxes
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah but you’re also saying you're going to stay in surplus
SHORTEN:  If you want to talk about bullying, how about that LNP trying to threaten Melissa Price's job?
PRIME MINISTER:  There have. 
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, good morning to you. 
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, we have said that if you currently negatively gear, you will keep negative gearing
PRIME MINISTER:  With his wife's disappearance having become the focus of an intense media circus, a man sees the spotlight turned on him when it's suspected that he may not be innocent
INTERVIEWER:  But you see, the date today Scott, the date today Prime Minister, is the 18th February 18
SHORTEN:  Let's say it as it is, the Australian people are so far ahead of the politicians on renewable energy it's not a joke but what I am going to do if we get elected is we're backing renewables, we're backing the batteries, we want people to get between a 60 and 90 per cent reduction off their household bills
PRIME MINISTER:  Well for the last six months, Ben, since I've taken over as Prime Minister, it's been my task really to get out to Australians all over the country and explain what we're doing as a Government, where we're going to take Australia after the next election if we're successful
INTERVIEWER:  Joining the ranks of the great journalism of the ABC, it would be a nice fit, it seems
PRIME MINISTER:  I think what they're going to do at the next election is decide who they want to continue to lead the country over the next three years
SHORTEN:  It is up to them.  
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  You know that’s not the question I’ve asked. 
SHORTEN:  Do you know what? I think Mr Dutton should refer himself
PRIME MINISTER:  I didn't support that at the time. 
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, good morning, welcome. 
SHORTEN:  Yes, for the vast bulk of people we are offering the same thing
PRIME MINISTER:  So would you go to the barbeque?
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister thank you for your time this evening
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m looking forward to that. 
SHORTEN:  About a million Australian families will benefit from our initiative on child care
INTERVIEWER:  Okay on the question of immigration - and here I’m not talking about the policy of immigration so much as the rhetoric of immigration, the discourse around immigration - do you think it's a problem when we talk about asylum seekers in particular through the prism of the possibility of them being rapists, of being murderers, of being paedophiles? This kind of ‘quasi Trumpian’ language? In his case applied to Mexicans
SHORTEN:  Cab driver Max picks up a man who offers him $600 to drive him around
PRIME MINISTER:  Collin must make it through his final three days of probation for a chance at a new beginning
INTERVIEWER:  Very quickly you popped up on Snapchat in the past couple of days and we in fact played one of your videos yesterday
SHORTEN:  Yes, but it is a development.  Also there's a Nationals Member of Parliament, perhaps a quiet achiever is what you would call him, Mr Hogan up in Page, and he's said he's going to sit on the crossbench as well
PRIME MINISTER:  I just answered that question. 
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah. 
SHORTEN:  Well, my absolute conviction and belief, is that if we don't change, then the cost will be far greater than any initial investments
PRIME MINISTER:  When Tony Stark tries to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and Earth’s Mightiest Heroes are put to the ultimate test as the fate of the planet hangs in the balance
INTERVIEWER:  What is the difference between your Climate Solutions Fund and the Emissions Reduction Fund created by Tony Abbott?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well again Fran you’re seeing it as expenditure.  We don't see it as that, we see it as an investment in Australians to keep our economy growing
SHORTEN:  lower the prices, take real action on climate change and ensure reliability
INTERVIEWER:  13 minutes to 9, Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister is with me, we’re running out of time rapidly
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah look you've got to be everywhere to talk to Australians these days and of all ages
SHORTEN:  Well I don't think this country is getting a better deal from the third Liberal Prime Minister in five years
INTERVIEWER:  $46 million - let's hope it saves some lives, 65 deaths since the start of December, way too many
SHORTEN:  In the future, a strange fungus has changed nearly everyone into a thoughtless, flesh-eating monster
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we’ve already had more than 1. 25 million jobs created since we were first elected and one of the reasons we’ve been able to do that is through these services
INTERVIEWER:  Thank you very much for your time. 
PRIME MINISTER:  The Queensland Government is working with us on that
SHORTEN:  Well I think you've got to work on that.  We've got to make the kids safe
INTERVIEWER:  Let me rephrase it Prime Minister –
SHORTEN:  Yeah.  I would pick a more positive number than costs
PRIME MINISTER:  After his career is destroyed, a brilliant but arrogant surgeon gets a new lease on life when a sorcerer takes him under her wing and trains him to defend the world against evil
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, good morning to you. 
SHORTEN:  Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt return as heads of the Baker family who, while on vacation, find themselves in competition with a rival family of eight children, headed by Eugene Levy,
PRIME MINISTER:  Buddy is doing great, he has made a number of appearances
INTERVIEWER:  And I'll have the chance to ask the Prime Minister about some of that when he comes on the program
SHORTEN:  There will be no change to existing investors. 
PRIME MINISTER:  That’ll be done by the Tasmanian Government, to the extent to which they’ll bring in other partners
INTERVIEWER:  We do know, as you also know, that the economy is slowing, so won't this hurt the economy down the track?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I'm not commenting on where it might come from other than to say the sophistication, as I said in the Parliament yesterday, has led agencies to advise that this is a state actor but I'm not
SHORTEN:  Yes.  I mean, the Prime Minister, you said something that he said which deserves answering and this is the first occasion I've had to answer it since his remarkable press conference
INTERVIEWER:  You wanted to look forward and you wanted to talk about the tone
SHORTEN:  Well all the research and science and experts make it clear that the more early years learning we can give our kids before they go to school, it just absolutely, quantum improves their learning experience at schools
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m no expert.  We’ll put the tips in but I was there for the Swans game against Richmond, but they had I say seem to be coming good in that that second quarter and the third quarter, it unravelled a bit
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, good morning to you.  
PRIME MINISTER:  And I have. 
SHORTEN:  The place would erupt if if they rolled him.  
INTERVIEWER:  Right, just a couple of things here because there is thousands of pages this stuff
SHORTEN:  A tough Russian policeman is forced to partner up with a cocky Chicago police detective when he is sent to Chicago to apprehend a Georgian drug lord who killed his partner and fled the country
PRIME MINISTER:  Harry, Ron and Hermione continue their quest to vanquish the evil Voldemort once and for all
INTERVIEWER:  She’s the cat’s mother [laughter] sorry that’s a private joke
SHORTEN:  To the best of my knowledge, no Labor candidate believes three year old child care is a political conspiracy
PRIME MINISTER:  Nothing will change under our Government because we know what we’re doing works
INTERVIEWER:  Can I just be honest here, ScoMo.  I was questioning whether this Government’s priorities lie, because as a woman in this country living through a domestic violence epidemic, coming fresh off the back of the latest horrific crime that has happened against a woman, I was waiting to hear kind of the next move on that and then this kind of come out of left field
SHORTEN:  We will in principle.  I mean it would have to be a pretty amazing reason not to
PRIME MINISTER:  That program has been running and we’re extending it as part of what I’m announcing today
INTERVIEWER:  Do you need the address of the Governor-General’s joint?
SHORTEN:  Of course. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no you will see current ones. 
INTERVIEWER:  The New Zealand minister over there Andrew Little says that authorities there were only really alert to this midway through last year
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s not too bad?
SHORTEN:  Well, if you think we're catching, if you think that we are hearing all of the insider deals that go on well I don’t share that view
INTERVIEWER:  But is it about funding? What is it that seems to be at the core of this? What is the problem with aged care?
PRIME MINISTER:  I think they should exercise caution and await further official advice
SHORTEN:  Sherlock Holmes and Dr.  Watson find themselves in 1890s London in this holiday special
[Inaudible]
INTERVIEWER:  You were photographed over the break wearing rainbow coloured board shorts
SHORTEN:  After defeating Frieza, Goku returns to Earth and goes on a camping trip with Gohan and Krillin
PRIME MINISTER:  A number of issues.   I was in Gippsland yesterday, meeting with drought affected farmers, and they have raised a number of issues with me about support
INTERVIEWER:  I get that and fair enough, but I do want to pick you up on a point you made there on the Government and them being a house divided
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks, Deb. 
SHORTEN:  And it didn't exist before we got there but I spent a lot of time talking to people with disability and their careers and then we built up a coalition of people who really wanted to see a better deal
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Are we still trusting them?
PRIME MINISTER:  The NDIS is a massive social programme, it’s the biggest change since Medicare
SHORTEN:  If you don’t start – you are quite right, and what sort of world are we passing on to the next generation? We know this government is paralysed on climate change, and if they weren’t, Malcolm Turnbull would still be the Prime Minister, wouldn’t he?
INTERVIEWER:  Surpluses have been promised though and not delivered in the past
SHORTEN:  As America's stock of athletic young men is depleted during World War II, a professional all-female baseball league springs up in the Midwest, funded by publicity-hungry candy maker Walter Harvey (Garry Marshall)
PRIME MINISTER:  Well you know I'll be taking that up with Border Force
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister Scott Morrison, good morning to you
PRIME MINISTER:  That's right.  As all cancer sufferers tell you when you talk to them, they also want to see more money going to research and treatment facilities
SHORTEN:  First of all it’s a silly policy and it’s a policy that isn't going to happen
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, just a final issue before you go.  You used to appear very regularly on Ray Hadley's radio program, what is your reaction to the allegations that 730 has aired this evening regarding Mr Hadley's workplace conduct?
SHORTEN:  I think we are, but I think some of the shenanigans at the top level and the personality conflicts has left people disillusioned, but the way we will get around that is that we'll just go back to a more independent process to pick the senior leadership of the ABC
PRIME MINISTER: Well, we have been tracking through our agencies, this form of extremism
INTERVIEWER:  No, no let me explain it. 
SHORTEN:  We've said that we don't want to see any Commonwealth tax-payer money directly or indirectly go into it, we've seen the missed deadlines, we're sceptics
PRIME MINISTER:  (laugh) No, I think one is enough.  
INTERVIEWER:  Captain's call?
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah. 
SHORTEN:  We want to try and get things done in the Parliament - that's why we're going to keep pushing for a national anti-corruption commission
INTERVIEWER:  That's a matter for me to Scott Morrison about.  With all -
SHORTEN:  Complete strangers stranded at a remote desert motel during a raging storm soon find themselves the target of a deranged murderer
PRIME MINISTER:  When an IMF mission ends badly, the world is faced with dire consequences
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Only the strong will survive. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Obsessed with teaching his victims the value of life, a deranged, sadistic serial killer abducts the morally wayward
SHORTEN:  That's an issue for a plebiscite.  
INTERVIEWER:  A better reality awaits. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah it is I just got to get the breathing right and I’m getting it there, I’ve got up to about 600 metres a day so that’s, if I can do it all in one go it will be even better
SHORTEN:  Well we set up the National Disability Insurance Scheme when I was last in government
INTERVIEWER:  It wasn't sold well. 
SHORTEN:  Yeah, sure.  
PRIME MINISTER:  They are already doing that in terms of how they manage their burn management programs and that is part of the reverse auction process
INTERVIEWER:  Overnight, its been announced by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs that the Dawn Service in France at the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial Centre, the Monash Centre, which has just been completed at a cost of, I think, $100 million, they don’t want to run a Dawn Service anymore, they want to move it to a 10 o’clock ANZAC Day service, what’s your view, is it good or bad?
SHORTEN:  The Wishbone family is far from happy.  With a struggling bookshop, an overworked husband, and two misunderstood teenagers, Emma is at her wit's end trying to be the perfect mom
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s what this stuff is about I mean, I mean I’m you know families are important, families should have meals together at night and not spend, you know, the evenings-
INTERVIEWER:  But now to other news, a bit closer to home and Bill Shorten is promising to fund $200 million worth of free blood tests for cancer patients and older Australians on day six of the federal election campaign
SHORTEN:  I'm confident, based on the economic reforms that we've engaged in in Opposition, that we will a very positive position on surplus over the four years, and a much better position than the Liberals over the 10 years, because we're winding back unsustainable tax subsidies at the top end, which in fact the Government want to keep
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s reasonable that Peter would have found that quite offensive –
INTERVIEWER:  Superannuation I'm talking about.  Paul Keating and others set up superannuation so it would entice people to save for their retirement so they would be less of a burden on Government across all demographics
SHORTEN:  No.  I've written to Mr Morrison - this is all pretty fast moving as you’d appreciate -  what I have written to Mr Morrison is a letter where I congratulate him, but I've also read media reports that they are rushing to appoint a new Governor-General, although the existing Governor-General's term doesn't finish until the end of March next year
PRIME MINISTER:  What you yourselves said would be its allocated money and people are desperate for services and not getting them
INTERVIEWER:  I want to ask you about housing prices now, housing prices have gone up in Sydney and Melbourne by close to 10% in the last 12 months
SHORTEN:  No, that's right.  Someone's got to have the courage to stand up for the next generation, that's what we will do
PRIME MINISTER:  This is true and they were our Australians of the Year, in fact
INTERVIEWER:  True. 
SHORTEN:  Yes.  So I think the Government doesn't want to have an election, but on the other hand I think the people of  Australia are feeling quite left out of all the decisions that have been happening recently
PRIME MINISTER:  And temporary protection visas. 
INTERVIEWER:  The Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten, joins me now from Melbourne
SHORTEN:  Nothing at all, all I'm saying is that when we talk about fiscal management what happens in Australia is that it's not the politicians who drive for good fiscal outcomes in Australia it is the companies, it's the people who go to work
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, the $5. 8 million that we’re spending up in Cooktown, that includes the reconciliation of the Rocks Precinct, the development of the Botanical Gardens, the upgrades to the Gamaay Dreaming Track and the Waymburr Story Project
INTERVIEWER:  But where's your credibility on apprenticeships, if you've in fact, as you have, been cutting TAFE? You may have been putting money into private training up providers
PRIME MINISTER:  Whatever you like. 
SHORTEN:  And did you know since then - what is it? 5,420 marriages have occurred
INTERVIEWER:  I say this with respect this morning, Mr Shorten, back on the bus
SHORTEN:  Well, if they have a surplus we think this is a good thing but it's because there's increased taxation on companies
PRIME MINISTER:  Well no that's not quite what it said, to be honest
INTERVIEWER:  Yay well done!
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, that’s what they say. 
SHORTEN:  An American pilot is sent to a Chinese province to teach a crew of would-be pilots how to fly war planes against the Japanese during World War II
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  What was the ambassador's explanation for the President's comment?
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I accept that some of the unions would rather that we handled it in a different way –
PRIME MINISTER:  There is a reason we're going into a surplus Budget next year is because of the hard work of Australians
INTERVIEWER:  You have been on the bus.  
SHORTEN:  This all-female horror anthology features four dark tales from four fiercely talented women
PRIME MINISTER:  A picture-perfect family is shattered when the work of a serial killer hits too close to home
INTERVIEWER:  Power.  Grace
SHORTEN:  It was a relief.  That was the point
PRIME MINISTER:  Tony Abbott was there and he said it didn’t happen
INTERVIEWER:  Was the Environment Minister ever pressured to get those Adani agreements done, will this free you up in your decision to call the election? And you’re a religious man, does Easter factor into any plans for an election date?
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks Paul. 
SHORTEN:  Baby Bink couldn't ask for more; he has adoring (if somewhat sickly-sweet) parents, he lives in a huge mansion, and he's just about to appear in the social pages of the paper
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  But what is the initial - 
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh no, we’re good, we’re good. 
SHORTEN:  No, it was everyone.  It was a collective effort
INTERVIEWER:  It probably is. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I think it’s important for all of us – and today is Harmony Day
SHORTEN:  Coal and our gas are important industries going forward
INTERVIEWER:  I mean, Chloe and Jenny get on quite well, actually, because they’re conscripts to what Bill and I do
SHORTEN:  Well, you'd have to say that we're on board somewhat reluctantly
PRIME MINISTER:  Bill Shorten didn’t declare a donation to his own campaign for eight years
INTERVIEWER:  Yesterday a boatload of Vietnamese people arrived up at the Daintree River in far north Queensland, is that a failure of Australia to secure its borders?
SHORTEN:  Sorry about that Lisa. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, I was the shadow immigration minister at the time and I was very concerned about these issues and the way people were feeling in the community
INTERVIEWER:  Given that track record of behaviour –
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no, it was all shut down about October last year and so when they do that and decommission a facility like that, they have a procedure for actually standing it up again
SHORTEN:  No, I haven’t quite got around to that. 
INTERVIEWER:  Where’s your evidence that higher taxes weaken an economy?
PRIME MINISTER:  That is my Budget. 
SHORTEN:  A look behind the scenes at Bernie Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme, how it was perpetrated on the public and the trail of destruction it left in its wake, both for the victims and Madoff's family
INTERVIEWER:  Thank you for joining us.  You went to Christmas Island yesterday
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks guys, good to talk to talk to you. 
SHORTEN:  Graced with a velvet voice, 21-year-old Violet Sanford heads to New York to pursue her dream of becoming a songwriter only to find her aspirations sidelined by the accolades and notoriety she receives at her "day" job as a barmaid at Coyote Ugly
INTERVIEWER:  No, it’s ordinary people. 
SHORTEN:  Arthur is a spirited ten-year old whose parents are away looking for work, whose eccentric grandfather has been missing for several years, and who lives with his grandmother in a country house that, in two days, will be repossessed, torn down, and turned into a block of flats unless Arthur's grandfather returns to sign some papers and pay off the family debt
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh okay –
INTERVIEWER:  Doesn’t pass the sniff test, does it?
SHORTEN:  Well good point.  I think back in 2004, the then Labor Party in Parliament felt a bit stampeded
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I said we’re going to make these decisions at the time nominations close and then we'll apply those decisions at that time as a Party organisation
INTERVIEWER:  Yep. 
SHORTEN:  How does that help keep us safe and strong?
PRIME MINISTER:  he's yet to tell his family or friends he's gay and he doesn't know the identity of the anonymous classmate he's fallen for online
INTERVIEWER:  But you would rather they didn’t. 
SHORTEN:  John Carter is a war-weary, former military captain who's inexplicably transported to the mysterious and exotic planet of Barsoom (Mars) and reluctantly becomes embroiled in an epic conflict
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we'll wait for who is on the list of every candidate all around the country
INTERVIEWER:  Just a peek, just a little, even an accidental look
SHORTEN:  The problem with what you're saying is that you assume that there's no cost to doing nothing, and there is
PRIME MINISTER:  The Labor Party's answer to every question.  Bill Shorten’s answer to every question is higher taxes
INTERVIEWER:  Does Labor support boat turn backs and will that policy continue if you're in office?
SHORTEN:  Cinderella's Hot Night presents a lively retelling of the classic fairy tale
PRIME MINISTER:  There will be applications, I have no doubt about it, and the asylum groups are doing what they always do and that is seeking to undermine the Government's policies
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Okay let’s just turn our attention to the current sort of crisis happening on the Murray-Darling Basin as well
PRIME MINISTER:  Good on you, thanks Shad, thanks Carly. 
SHORTEN:  My preference is questions from the audience, just direct
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  So we don't know who did it. 
SHORTEN:  High School student David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) has a talent for hacking
PRIME MINISTER:  Between personal obligations and training for his next big fight against an opponent with ties to his family's past, Adonis Creed is up against the challenge of his life
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah.  
SHORTEN:  That's Kevin's opinion.  What I'm going to do is -
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh, we’ll see. 
INTERVIEWER:  There seems to be a lot more detail coming out about what this is going to do, some of Bill Shorten’s changes when it comes to tax
SHORTEN:  A young soldier faces profound disillusionment in the soul-destroying horror of World War I
PRIME MINISTER:  Correct. 
INTERVIEWER:  Not committing you to but starting conversations about the possibility of a preference deal
SHORTEN:  Lara Croft ventures to an underwater temple in search of the mythological Pandora's Box but, after securing it, it is promptly stolen by the villainous leader of a Chinese crime syndicate
PRIME MINISTER:  Thirty years after the events of the first film, a new blade runner, LAPD Officer K, unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos
INTERVIEWER:  All right.  Prime Minister we're out of time
PRIME MINISTER:  What I’m saying today is we that we’ve got a very strong record of achievement
SHORTEN:  We've got the policies which are in the interests of working and middle Australia
INTERVIEWER:  It’s a good argument, that.  They’ve paid tax all their life, that answers that argument
SHORTEN:  Rachel Keller must prevent evil Samara from taking possession of her son's soul
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh, I’d probably pop in once or twice a month, maybe
INTERVIEWER:  The ones who changed will change everything. 
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s not a traditional clobber, it should be a respectful ceremony
SHORTEN:  A woman turns to prescription medication as a way of handling her anxiety concerning her husband's upcoming release from prison
INTERVIEWER:  I was watching Q&A at the start of the week. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, it's a satellite city and it has been. 
SHORTEN:  Thank you very much. 
INTERVIEWER:  Only the act of true love will thaw a frozen heart
PRIME MINISTER:  Cheers. 
SHORTEN:  After a mysterious global crisis, a young girl is left alone to hide from a malevolent power that stalks her home
INTERVIEWER:  Firstly, tell us why you’re here today?
PRIME MINISTER:  No because what I'm announcing is an infrastructure project in the context of an entire population strategy Neil, this isn't just a one-off announcement
SHORTEN:  We are up for reviewing it and we want to review it positively
INTERVIEWER:  A New Age Has Come. 
SHORTEN:  But we got the right outcome.  That day, in front of the State Library was awesome
PRIME MINISTER:  Do you think it’s reasonable –
INTERVIEWER:  But by ‘modest impact’ it will cause a further decline in the price of houses
SHORTEN:  Slightly disturbed and painfully shy Angela Baker is sent away to summer camp with her cousin
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t make anything of it. 
INTERVIEWER:  Hello Scott and thank you for giving the time to me
PRIME MINISTER:  Absolutely.  At the last Budget, I said we were going to do the Melbourne Airport Rail Link and we have signed the heads of agreement with the state government there in Victoria to achieve just that
SHORTEN:  Undercover Las Vegas police officer Vincent Downs is caught in a high stakes web of corrupt cops and the mob-controlled casino underground
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister good morning. 
SHORTEN:  It doesn't matter if it's a union who comes to me or a business, an environmental activist
PRIME MINISTER:  Michael, this is our economic plan to ensure that our economy is built strong over the next decade and that Australians have the opportunities that they're seeking for themselves, because this is a Budget that is backing hardworking Australians
INTERVIEWER:  Susie says it distracts from the fact that I’ve got a huge nose and I’ve got a forehead, a massive forehead and googly eyes and I sometimes put her off so she’s asked for me to wear the ski mask-
SHORTEN:  The story of a young man who arrives in Hollywood during the 1930s hoping to work in the film industry, falls in love, and finds himself swept up in the vibrant café society that defined the spirit of the age
PRIME MINISTER:  Talking about policy. 
INTERVIEWER:  Has the Coalition given up on cutting the company tax rate for large business? You were telling us a couple of years ago that our international competitiveness was being destroyed by the comparatively high company tax rate
SHORTEN:  See you. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No that’s not true.  That report was rubbish
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  What do you remember of that time?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well can’t you see that what you’re suggesting –
SHORTEN:  Follows a young man named Albert and his horse, Joey, and how their bond is broken when Joey is sold to the cavalry and sent to the trenches of World War One
INTERVIEWER:  So how can it start in 18 months when cash flow starts in three years?
PRIME MINISTER:  A story of encounters and partings interwoven between people; this is a human drama with feelings that touch one's heart gradually, which everyone has experienced at least once
SHORTEN:  Well, far be it from me to judge the Turnbull legacy but I think that this is another opportunity that he missed
INTERVIEWER:  Kevin Rudd. 
SHORTEN:  Three detectives in the corrupt and brutal L. A
PRIME MINISTER:  I’ve said we're going to make that decision at the time of the nominations closing
INTERVIEWER: It’s wonderful to welcome the Prime Minister Scott Morrison live in the studio
SHORTEN:  Well, some people say that to me.  But with the division and the instability of the government, the fact that the Liberals sacked Malcolm Turnbull nine weeks ago, then they have got to send him to Bali to clean up the new Prime Minister's foreign policy mess, the chaos has got to end
PRIME MINISTER:  I hope not. 
INTERVIEWER:  Obviously. 
SHORTEN:  Rodney Copperbottom is a young robot inventor who dreams of making the world a better place, until the evil Ratchet takes over Big Weld Industries
PRIME MINISTER:  Harry, Ron and Hermione walk away from their last year at Hogwarts to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes, putting an end to Voldemort's bid for immortality
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister welcome to 7. 30 for 2019
PRIME MINISTER:  To spice up a dinner party, old friends agree to share every private message that pops up on their phones -- with disastrous results
SHORTEN:  I think we're competitive but we're not arrogant.  When I come to Western Australia I don't look at Liberal Western Australians and Labor Western Australians or you know, Independent Western Australians - I just see Western Australians
INTERVIEWER:  Quick, that’s good on time.  You had ten seconds left Suse
PRIME MINISTER:  Well my secret in life is to always have assumed that I’m never the smartest person in the room
SHORTEN:  No, not at all.  What’s happening now is that this government is raising record taxes and they spend it on property investors on their sixth house with negative gearing
INTERVIEWER:  Ok
SHORTEN:  listen, you're the reason why the vote is going to go down
PRIME MINISTER:  Well because it will crash the economy.  It is not needed to have a higher target that will close industries and close jobs
INTERVIEWER:  Well, they've got a whole lot of analysis that says 300,000 voters in Labor electorates will be hit
PRIME MINISTER:  Can I just say one last thing Alan. 
SHORTEN:  Well, we've been doing a lot of hard work in the last five years as a united and stable opposition
INTERVIEWER:  How convincingly does Bill Shorten claim the moral high ground on anything?
SHORTEN:  We've already said that we would put money back into the Catholic and non-government system but Labor believes in education
PRIME MINISTER:  And you can just feel it.  I mean just talking to people at Sporties last night, talking to local tradies, talking to people in the building and civil construction industry
INTERVIEWER:  Here we go. 
SHORTEN:  Twenty-eight-year-old Georgia is convinced the man of her dreams is "the one that got away" back in high school
PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
INTERVIEWER:  Oh, it was the heat of the moment thing? Is that what you’re saying?
PRIME MINISTER:  Harry starts his fourth year at Hogwarts, competes in the treacherous Triwizard Tournament and faces the evil Lord Voldemort
SHORTEN:  Based on a true story set in pre-war Japan, a man and one of his servants begin a torrid affair
INTERVIEWER:  [inaudible] aren’t you confusing, no aren’t you confusing voters? You’re saying our record is so fantastic, we’ve exceeded expectations it’s confusing to people, they just saw a Prime Minister get dumped a matter of months ago
SHORTEN:  Well, there's two ingredients, aren't there? First of all, there's permanent migration
PRIME MINISTER:  Inside a snowflake exists the magical land of Whoville
INTERVIEWER:  You know, the Labor Party love it every time you talk about them?
PRIME MINISTER:  Robert McCall, who serves an unflinching justice for the exploited and oppressed, embarks on a relentless, globe-trotting quest for vengeance when a long-time girl friend is murdered
SHORTEN:  I have only read what you read.  Mr Assange is entitled to his day in court
INTERVIEWER:  How can it not have that impact?
SHORTEN:  Well first of all you know that we’ve offered Channel Nine the opportunity to do it through the Press Club
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah that’s right.  It’s going to focus on elective surgery, it’s going to focus on mental health care, maternity services, breast cancer diagnoses
INTERVIEWER:  Well they’re both hypothetical
SHORTEN:  we won't be spending as a company director, money chasing votes when they need to go to repay the taxpayers and the workers what they are owed to begin with
PRIME MINISTER:  As Christmas approaches, Amelia Hughes, a career-focused Chicago app developer lacking in holiday spirit, returns to her small hometown of Christmas Creek to rediscover the meaning of Christmas
INTERVIEWER:  $50 million in four years, the rest might follow. 
PRIME MINISTER:  … and I think she's an extraordinary Australian.  An Australian of the Year and there  have been few people more than Ita that I think have lifted the standards of journalism in this country and I think that says a lot about her character and her abilities
SHORTEN:  I don't see how that's possible.  We'll have to see what the Government is thinking and they need to consult on the terms of reference
INTERVIEWER:  Well coming back to the energy - because as I’ve said I actually sent a message to Josh Frydenberg, I said look, congratulations and so on, but I'm sorry, you haven't released the most important economic document this week
PRIME MINISTER:  Because I don't think it helps Neil, for us to just get into this slanging match between all of the personalities here
SHORTEN:  A Muslim ambassador exiled from his homeland, Ahmad ibn Fadlan finds himself in the company of Vikings
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, you know what - 
SHORTEN:  The evil Dr.  Kochin uses the dragon balls to resurrect his mentor, Dr
PRIME MINISTER:  Good morning Alan. 
INTERVIEWER:  At the last election when Labor proposed to wind back negative gearing, the housing market was experiencing much stronger growth than it is now
SHORTEN:  White Castle hamburgers.  Both guys are at a crossroads, about to make major decisions that will affect the course of their lives
PRIME MINISTER:  Exactly, $200 billion including the $5 billion on retirees
INTERVIEWER:  No, I’m not suggesting that at all PM.  But people have been talking underwater
PRIME MINISTER:  So I took the decision together with the Finance Minister and the Treasurer to extend that payment so it would simply pass the Parliament, as it did today without any fuss and without any trouble
SHORTEN:  It's not a simple yes or no issue.  If we can take people in based upon our infrastructure, based upon the moving to the regions that's a plus
INTERVIEWER:  Do you ever look?
SHORTEN:  Benjamin, a young German computer whiz, is invited to join a subversive hacker group that wants to be noticed on the world's stage
PRIME MINISTER:  We opposed the bill. 
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, they wouldn’t like that. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
SHORTEN:  Well, I don’t accept that.  First of all, the idea that the environment and the economy are two separate planets and separate solar systems is rubbish
INTERVIEWER:  The Legend Ends. 
SHORTEN:  In the year 10,191, the world is at war for control of the desert planet Dune – the only place where the time-travel substance 'Spice' can be found
PRIME MINISTER:  Agent Matt Graver teams up with operative Alejandro Gillick to prevent Mexican drug cartels from smuggling terrorists across the United States border
INTERVIEWER:  He did said a lot of times, eight times in fact in that speech
SHORTEN:  Well I  think that successive governments over the decades have tried to tackle this issue of big cities being overcrowded
PRIME MINISTER:  This is exactly as it is.  This is how I describe their policy
INTERVIEWER:  What kind of condition is it in, if it hasn't been used for a year? Is it full of cobwebs and mothballs?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well there are Chinese companies that already do own parts of coal mining operations in New South Wales currently and otherwise those operations probably wouldn’t even be there, which is no good for those who work in those places
SHORTEN:  Fairness.  We think that Australia Day is about Australian values
INTERVIEWER:  Did I hear you right that you said that people haven’t warmed to him?
SHORTEN:  Valerie is in love with a brooding outsider, Peter, but her parents have arranged for her to marry another man – who is wealthy
PRIME MINISTER:  That will be in the Government's bill this morning when it's introduced into the House -
INTERVIEWER:  No, no.  We just go through the score, yeah
PRIME MINISTER:  That's it. 
SHORTEN:  Ben Campbell is a young, highly intelligent, student at M
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Well exactly, so it was a mistake that Newstart recipients missed out?
PRIME MINISTER:  I'm happy to call out people, as others have sought to call me out on things, I'm not shy about doing these sorts of things
SHORTEN:  Thank you. 
INTERVIEWER:  Let me rephrase –
PRIME MINISTER:  That is all true.  And by contrast what do we say? We're saying that the instant asset write off goes from $25,000 to $30,000
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I don't know where the Government thinks they get the money they spend from
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister I wish you all the best with that endeavour
SHORTEN:  There's a couple of big hypotheticals there aren't there, Lisa
PRIME MINISTER:  Good morning Fran. 
INTERVIEWER:  On policy you also have a plan you were discussing today, a ten year plan to wipe out debt, but that would mean for that plan to reach fruition the Coalition would be re-elected three times, there would be no external shocks
PRIME MINISTER:  Members of Parliament have meetings with people all the time, the suggestion here is that something inappropriate was done
SHORTEN:  Yes, I am confident that we have got positive policies and we don't need to go down the negative divisive path
INTERVIEWER:  Oh good.  Why should we trust Border Force? I mean, they have mucked up this footballer, Hakeem al-Araibi
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes, I met with two sufferers, and they were in remission, on Monday
SHORTEN:  Well, I think that there's been a lot of developments, hasn't there? This is not just Labor saying there's a cloud over the eligibility of a senior minister - it's now Malcolm Turnbull, it's now Julie Bishop
[Advertisement/traffic advice/music break]
INTERVIEWER:  Is it wise though to be spending the extra money that we do have when there are those headwinds that are facing our economy? Should we be putting this surplus in the bank?
SHORTEN:  Well I've explained that I didn't understand the question that was being asked
PRIME MINISTER:  It doesn't excuse it. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten, well what about your sausage eating style, could that play into it? On Saturday, you know, you were doing a better job of it after going for the sideways bite
PRIME MINISTER:  One night per year, the government sanctions a 12-hour period in which citizens can commit any crime they wish -- including murder -- without fear of punishment or imprisonment
SHORTEN:  Well, I just hope that the treating medical advice gets taken seriously
INTERVIEWER:  Not planning to go to Canberra on Sunday?
SHORTEN:  Corporate downsizing expert Ryan Bingham spends his life in planes, airports, and hotels, but just as he’s about to reach a milestone of ten million frequent flyer miles, he meets a woman who causes him to rethink his transient life
PRIME MINISTER:  No that’s not right Jon. 
INTERVIEWER:  Good on you, well done and thank you for your time Prime Minister
PRIME MINISTER:  None at all. 
SHORTEN:  Cal Weaver is living the American dream.  He has a good job, a beautiful house, great children and a beautiful wife, named Emily
INTERVIEWER:  So you reject Mr Morrison's suggestion that if this Phelps Bill were to pass that it would give people smugglers an opening to restart the trade?
SHORTEN:  Well, sorry, no, it’s actually been shown that over time when you pay for less petrol, it actually costs less
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, sure. 
INTERVIEWER:  We appreciate your time this morning, Bill Shorten
SHORTEN:  The hyperactive red-headed bird enters a turf war with a big city lawyer wanting to tear down his home in an effort to build a house to flip
PRIME MINISTER:  A gritty crime saga which follows the lives of an elite unit of the LA County Sheriff’s Dept
INTERVIEWER:  Every family tree hides a secret. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Lake Tahoe, 1969.  Seven strangers, each one with a secret to bury, meet at El Royale, a decadent motel with a dark past
SHORTEN:  The war against the Bugs continues! A Federation Starship crash-lands on the distant Alien planet OM-1, stranding beloved leader Sky Marshal Anoke and several others, including comely but tough pilot Lola Beck
INTERVIEWER: But are the increased risks still there?
SHORTEN:  Oh, we don't know that yet.  We're working very hard on it
PRIME MINISTER:  The story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius
INTERVIEWER:  The Letters Are Out. 
SHORTEN:  If you're asking me to specify what a particular company in a particular factory will have to do, I can't do that, nor could you, nor can the Government
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that was last year, Leigh, and what we’re focussed on is the plan we’re taking to the next election
INTERVIEWER:  Yes, I do. 
SHORTEN: I'm not going to give the Government a blank cheque
PRIME MINISTER:  And there was there was risk and you say it didn't exist because the bill didn't allow for it
INTERVIEWER:  Dark Secrets Revealed. 
SHORTEN:  Well, maybe - but he hasn't moved to embassy either, so - 
PRIME MINISTER:  For any Senator to say that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs were responsible for the terrorist attacks in Christchurch?
INTERVIEWER:  Well haven’t three ministers in a row by saying they… [inaudible]
SHORTEN:  In terms of national security?
PRIME MINISTER:  I have no idea, I have never discussed it with her
INTERVIEWER:  Well we do need to do something because our now Prime Minister, what's his name again? I can't keep up with which one we've got
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks, great to be here. 
SHORTEN:  Oh Hamish, I think there is a little bit of excitement in your heart, you just need to find it
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister congratulations and thank you. 
PRIME MINISTER:  During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew
SHORTEN:  Yeah well, there is a way to go, things close up.  But what I'm going to do is focus on the people
INTERVIEWER:  Will you run him below Labor?
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no hang on –
SHORTEN:  But we don't take this election for granted at all
INTERVIEWER:  Never tell him the odds. 
SHORTEN:  Cheers, see you mate. 
PRIME MINISTER:  [inaudible]
INTERVIEWER:  Courage runs deep. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I’d like to have more. 
SHORTEN:  Occasionally we do. 
INTERVIEWER:  Yep.  Very much true
PRIME MINISTER:  He didn't say now, I stress, he did not say it needed to go up now
SHORTEN:  I don’t think any of us that extreme weather events are getting less frequent, are they?
INTERVIEWER:  Well, they, I, I’m referring to what their policy claims are, which is only reasonable
SHORTEN:  Spans the period from 1958 to the present day and tells the story of an unconditional love between a mother and her daughter which is endangered by an unsteady and manipulative father

INTERVIEWER:  Who qualifies for the money? How much will they get and is it paid to parents or to child care centres? 
SHORTEN:  When this government, when the current Prime Minister was the loyal Treasurer, of the previous Prime Minister - if you believe that I've got a bridge to sell you - but anyway, when the Prime Minister was the Treasurer, when the current Treasurer was the former Environment Minister and when Malcolm Turnbull was still on top, they said the National Energy Guarantee would deliver $550 in lower household prices on energy
PRIME MINISTER:  Agreed.   
INTERVIEWER:  Bill if elected you've committed $10 million towards construction of the Victorian Pride Centre
SHORTEN:  Set between Episode II and III the Clone Wars is the first computer animated Star Wars film
PRIME MINISTER:  Sure this is, you know, this is crunch time. 
INTERVIEWER:  Our top story this morning the fall out of the Victorian election, joining us now is the most senior figure in the Labor Party from Victoria, Bill Shorten the Opposition Leader
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s the same answer to the question that was just put
SHORTEN:  Well, the Solicitor General's advice that they had, that broadly said that the better view that the Solicitor-General thought was that Mr Joyce was eligible, but they didn't give that categorical assurance and that's the same here
INTERVIEWER:  No rules this time. 
SHORTEN:  First of all, there's what happens before an election
PRIME MINISTER:  Well Jon, you can make up whatever mind you like about this but when it comes to border protection, I don’t think anyone can doubt my conviction, sincerity on this
INTERVIEWER:  Yes, the cap. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Because that is our economic record, Fran.  It's our economic record and the strength of the economy that matters to Australians going about their business today
SHORTEN:  love. 
INTERVIEWER:  We have watched the Budget and your reply very, very closely
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, it would only reinforce the need for the plan that we've announced today
SHORTEN:  Sure. 
INTERVIEWER:  A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. 
SHORTEN:  Listen, I don't want to get into a debate about the facts, but your last statement is 100 per cent wrong
PRIME MINISTER:  Lara Jean's love life goes from imaginary to out of control when her secret letters to every boy she's ever fallen for are mysteriously mailed out
INTERVIEWER:  Love is the greatest gift of all. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Now that is true, as is gas, as is hydro. 
SHORTEN:  We will do that closer to the election but suffice to say we have done our maths and we are able to pay for the promises we are making
INTERVIEWER:  But as a government you are adopting it as your policy
PRIME MINISTER:  When an unexpected enemy emerges and threatens global safety and security, Nick Fury, director of the international peacekeeping agency known as S
SHORTEN:  You can't sugar-coat this.  This is an Australian citizen who has been detained in China, the Embassy has just been notified
INTERVIEWER:  Just ask your daughters, ask your daughters whether or not they should be consigned to the Vinnies Bin will you?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well anything's possible but that doesn’t mean it happened
SHORTEN:  It's so dishonest this debate.  It is so dishonest - 
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten is campaigning in Sydney this morning where he will reveal the latest details of the party's plans to cut cancer costs
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, I haven't commented on the polls for the last five years
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m not quite sure what you’re referring to.  When I refer to the Labor Party, I talk about the fact that their emissions reduction targets are going to cost wage earners $9,000 each a year
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten, the member for Solomon said that there would be a support package for the NT
PRIME MINISTER:  Léon, the top hit man in New York, has earned a rep as an effective "cleaner"
SHORTEN:  Well there's two issues there.  One is the person and the other is the office
INTERVIEWER:  If you need to have a glass of water while I ask the question, please feel free
PRIME MINISTER:  [Laughter] I'll leave that to others, but that's what I've been talking about from the day I became Prime Minister
SHORTEN:  I like the principle, that's my answer.  I think the principle of it
INTERVIEWER:  And that's right people are scared. 
SHORTEN:  I think it would, be if they rush this, this will be an act of desperation, and what they want to do is try and assert decisions for which they don't have any responsibility after the next election if they are unsuccessful
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks David, good to be with you. 
INTERVIEWER:  It was offered to him, once…
SHORTEN:  Thank you Jon. 
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s true at most places but not my house.  
INTERVIEWER:  I'll come to some of those points in a second.  I just want to ask about another of your controversial policies which is superannuation
SHORTEN:  You've got to tell people where they fit in.  Change is not too hard but you do have to make sure that you don't leave people behind
PRIME MINISTER:  That starts right away. 
INTERVIEWER:  OK quick one, as a rugby league fan, what do you make of the NRL players involved in leaked videos in these sex tapes? I know that Phil Gould from the Penrith Panthers says this goes beyond sport, it’s a massive issue for Australians mums and dads
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's only relevant if in the cases that we're talking about, that’s what is known about the actual individuals who may be subject to transfers
SHORTEN:  No, no.  Let's -
INTERVIEWER:  Oh, that’s right. 
PRIME MINISTER:  You can do that, but if we’re going to have a debate, we can have a debate or we can have an interview
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I've got to say that I think we should have an Australian head of state but my family, my eight year old is driving me crazy to meet Meghan Markle - there's no question that the royals - that every little girl loves a princess
INTERVIEWER:  We’ve got to explain to the Prime Minister why you’re wearing what you’re wearing right now
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, just on this issue of grandfathering, you are quite right, when it comes to negative gearing all of the people currently negatively geared will not be affected and you’ll still be able to negatively gear your houses…
PRIME MINISTER:  The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mysteries of Peter Quill's true parentage
INTERVIEWER:  There is no equal. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I know, but I also said that the Leader of the Opposition would be able give their reply
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, you know that when the polls are good or bad, over five years, one month and 13 days, I haven't commented
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Could you expand, please, on your comment that all options are open?
SHORTEN:  6-year-old Susan Walker has doubts about childhood's most enduring miracle—Santa Claus
PRIME MINISTER:  Sisters of the North; they have done an amazing job in raising funds for people up there and there's a bloke up there, Tim Pratt who runs a trucking company
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  I reckon they’re brilliant, yeah.  So what do you reckon about them? Do you have an opinion on them yet?
SHORTEN:  We will only ever give you facts - important facts
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m not planning to do that. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  OK.  Border protection
SHORTEN:  Only one leader in this country has done a deal with Clive Palmer
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, good luck with that. 
INTERVIEWER:  No, no, but it was only a week ago that the energy subsidy was announced and it looks like…
PRIME MINISTER:  They want to rebuild and they know it's not going to be easy
SHORTEN:  What our changes will mean is that it will be fairer, in terms of…
INTERVIEWER:  Well - 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes, that's my view and that was my view.  It has always been my view
SHORTEN:  After his wife dies, a blacksmith named Balian is thrust into royalty, political intrigue and bloody holy wars during the Crusades
INTERVIEWER:  But does that not concern you, that you are continually dropping as preferred Prime Minister?
PRIME MINISTER:  And they were wrong, they were wrong Waleed. 
SHORTEN:  Well I don't know the answer to that, but I'm not sure that Mr Morrison does
INTERVIEWER:  Well it was a great crowd, a record crowd for a women's AFL match
PRIME MINISTER:  True. 
SHORTEN:  Set on an island off the coast of New England in the summer of 1965, Moonrise Kingdom tells the story of two twelve-year-olds who fall in love, make a secret pact, and run away together into the wilderness
INTERVIEWER:  Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character
SHORTEN:  Well, that's all happened under the current government and that's at the heart of this election
PRIME MINISTER:  No, Jon, none of what you’ve just said is true at all
INTERVIEWER:  Alright, Prime Minister you’ve up against Susan.  Prime Minister you’ve got 30 seconds on the clock and your time starts now
PRIME MINISTER:  When the old-old-old-fashioned vampire Vlad arrives at the hotel for an impromptu family get-together, Hotel Transylvania is in for a collision of supernatural old-school and modern day cool
SHORTEN:  A getaway driver for a bank robbery realizes he has been double crossed and races to find out who betrayed him
INTERVIEWER:  Brenda out at Aspley picked up 100 bucks too and maybe a vote for you I’d have to say
SHORTEN:  Lovely thank you very much for your interest. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t have those figures to hand, Leigh.  What I do know is that population growth has not run as high as jobs growth
INTERVIEWER:  Isn’t the problem though that you’re trying to give something to everyone, and everyone can’t benefit
SHORTEN:  We're going to change the laws and we're going to put the resources to enforce the laws
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m very confident because that has been our form
INTERVIEWER:  So they’ve all got their own?
SHORTEN:  I don't know if he is back from Bali yet, with the old mop, cleaning up Mr Morrison's problems
PRIME MINISTER:  We stand by all of that because that was about the policy
INTERVIEWER:  So what's the point of having it then? Because I seem to recall when it was introduced, it was partly to make housing more affordable?
PRIME MINISTER:  He’s a pretty good fielder, he gets after those quick ones towards the boundary I think
SHORTEN:  There couldn't have been anyone who was committing me to a preference deal
INTERVIEWER:  You spoke about the tax on income versus the tax on capital
SHORTEN:  cement, steel, aluminium and other sectors.  We have created a $300 million dollar fund to help them invest in new technology
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t think you should vote for either of them.  That’s my view, that’s my very strong view
INTERVIEWER:  Yes, who promised that during the Wentworth election that he would have that removed within two weeks after that there
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, you tell me -
SHORTEN:  Author P. L
INTERVIEWER:  Particularly in an interview with a politician.  I'm going to let you set the agenda to begin with
SHORTEN:  I think there's a lot more water to go under the bridge but the real issue here in terms of Australians and why it matters to the everyday voter, is that you have the Minister for Home Affairs, a very important person, making very important decisions, there shouldn't be any Constitutional cloud over his eligibility to make those decisions, and I think that the Government needs to just clear the issue up
PRIME MINISTER:  He's entitled to his view but I think what Australians need and our economy needs is a balanced and responsible migration plan
INTERVIEWER:  Linda we’ve got to move on because we’ve got almost no time, we’ve got Phil on the line
PRIME MINISTER:  Cronulla is a long way from Aspley. 
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, the reason why we're doing it is there is no principle that says it is fair that a non-taxpayer gets a tax refund, a cash tax refund
INTERVIEWER:  We've got a lot to get through this morning so we will get cracking Mr Shorten
PRIME MINISTER:  We have one and we have been achieving it is.  It is a right thing to do for future generations
SHORTEN:  
INTERVIEWER:  Well no, you've squeezed the pipe. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I’m going to be busy all the way through mate, be busy all the way through
SHORTEN:  Following a wild night out with his Best Man, Rob Anderson wakes up to find himself naked in an elevator on the morning of his wedding day and is forced to relive the morning over and over again
INTERVIEWER:  Four and a half million taxpayers would receive that tax cut from the 1st of July
SHORTEN:  No.  Let's go to one
PRIME MINISTER:  Well they’re completely different things.  I mean the Great Barrier Reef Foundation that's money to actually apply over that period of time Alan and it's being done through one organization, so that wasn’t just today, that was for many, many years to come
INTERVIEWER:  We helped rescue people from a cave, didn’t we?
PRIME MINISTER:  Like it's taboo, you’re not allowed to mention it?
SHORTEN:  Yes, I thought the vote would be successful but what I realised on the morning of the vote being declared was the amount of pressure that a lot of people - LGBTQ people felt because what it was is this silly process which got the right outcome
INTERVIEWER:  No, but it’s an important difference isn’t it. 
PRIME MINISTER:  We will make those decisions –
SHORTEN:  Steve Ford is a private detective in Venice Beach, Calif
INTERVIEWER:  All right, the Financial Review front page says Morrison sticks to Paris, the Morrison Government will resist internal pressure to walk away from the Paris climate change target
PRIME MINISTER:  Let’s go through it. 
SHORTEN:  Well under Scott Morrison, immigration has gone up, not down
INTERVIEWER:  Be our guest. 
SHORTEN:  A former Secret Service agent grudgingly takes an assignment to protect a pop idol who's threatened by a crazed fan
PRIME MINISTER:  I remember the debates.  I remember when that boat crashed up on the jagged rocks of Christmas Island
INTERVIEWER:  If they've hacked in, there must be access to information
PRIME MINISTER:  All the major DC superheroes are starring in their own films, all but the Teen Titans, so Robin is determined to remedy this situation by getting over his role as a sidekick and becoming a movie star
SHORTEN:  No.  What we will do though is we're going to pick up what Malcolm Turnbull proposed
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, they're not hospital patients, they're not admitted, they're not outpatients
PRIME MINISTER:  That's my form Waleed. 
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, it's publicly available, now if we're saying, the campaign against climate change by this government is malicious and stupid
INTERVIEWER:  I'm asking you, no –
SHORTEN:  Well, it is certainly easier said than done, but we have got to do it
PRIME MINISTER:  Cheers mate. 
INTERVIEWER:  But what I’m asking you… what I’m asking you is in the government underwriting process that’s underway
PRIME MINISTER:  Good morning Deb. 
SHORTEN:  Well the Government sets great store on these matters
INTERVIEWER:  Pakenham, sorry.  Tax
SHORTEN:  Well, I think that part of the reason why Clive Palmer is copping some criticism is that he used to run a nickel plant or business interest associated with it in Townsville
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, let me talk about –
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  On Indigenous Affairs, Bill Shorten, Labor has said it will abolish the Community Development Program, and is campaigning hard on that issue here in the Territory
SHORTEN:  A deadly airborne virus finds its way into the USA and starts killing off people at an epidemic rate
PRIME MINISTER:  $144 billion is the legislated tax cuts that we currently have taken through the Parliament
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah I think Aspley might be within a Labor seat. 
SHORTEN:  Yeah –
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, it’s true. 
INTERVIEWER:  They’re not clients of hospitals at all.  They’re paid through community organisations and charities and they need more money
PRIME MINISTER:  Well Tanya Plibersek said this week that the Prime Minister has to explain to the Australian people how the facilities on Christmas Island are going to meet the need for what is now before us
SHORTEN:  Good morning Michael. 
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, regarding your claim that with your climate policies, we'd have GDP growth of 23 per cent in the 2020s, is that business as usual, the same as if you didn't have the climate plan, and where did you get the numbers from, I understand it's from the McKibbin report, but isn't that a bit outdated?
SHORTEN:  The rebellious Thracian Spartacus, born and raised a slave, is sold to Gladiator trainer Batiatus
PRIME MINISTER:  his daughter's laptop. 
INTERVIEWER:  It is a moot point I agree.  But I'm just interested
PRIME MINISTER:  Of course.  I mean, I didn't take the job on to, you know, to do anything else but that
SHORTEN:  Sorry, I didn't pluck that out of nowhere.  That was the Paris Agreement
INTERVIEWER:  OK, now sweeping changes to the welfare system are also going to be announced today
SHORTEN:  The dynamic duo of Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon return for another crazy adventure
PRIME MINISTER:  They’re criminals.  That’s what criminals do, they lie
INTERVIEWER:  Can I just be a bit critical of you here if I might
SHORTEN:  Frank Drebin is persuaded out of retirement to go undercover in a state prison

INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, welcome to Perth.

SHORTEN:  Set in the ghettos of Paris in 2010, an undercover cop and ex-thug try to infiltrate a gang in order to defuse a neutron bomb
INTERVIEWER:  The ACTU wants to see the minimum wage rise by $50 a week
PRIME MINISTER:  I am going to wait to see what all the nominations are and in our Party those decisions are made by the Party organisation
SHORTEN:  Listen I'm not going to get - sorry, there's only one person who has ever been resurrected and I'm not going to compare Clive Palmer to him
INTERVIEWER:  I’ll be watching, thanks very much. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well since I became Prime Minister, we’ve has I think now 19 women selected in key roles
SHORTEN:  Yes ours is a nine day tour, although because it overlapped with the weekend, I've had a day on the Sunshine Coast
INTERVIEWER:  There's More to Lose than a Title. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Believing they have left behind shadowy figures from their past, newlyweds Christian and Ana fully embrace an inextricable connection and shared life of luxury
SHORTEN:  Being one of 101 takes its toll on Patch, who doesn't feel unique
INTERVIEWER:  OK, good.  I'll let you go
PRIME MINISTER:  Ray Breslin manages an elite team of security specialists trained in the art of breaking people out of the world's most impenetrable prisons
SHORTEN:  Well, this is the other good news - what it's going to mean is if you can store the energy during the day - say the family watching the show this morning, the kids go off to school, mum and dad might go to work - what happens is at the moment, if you have just got solar panels, you don't get the energy when you need it which is in the evenings, when the kids turn computers on and you need the energy
INTERVIEWER:  Do you think he will?
PRIME MINISTER:  I mean last year when we did the Budget - I think I remember talking about spinal muscular atrophy and how that's changing the lives of young Australians and their parents - the letters I've had, the stories I've heard, I mean Greg Hunt has the best job in the world I think as the Health Minister to be able to make these changes
SHORTEN:  Yes, she and Penny and myself, we think that the time has come to revisit that
INTERVIEWER:  And what are the factors you’re considering?
SHORTEN:  We’re here to explain Labor’s great policies for this election
PRIME MINISTER:  In North Queensland, what we’re looking to do is establish what is the most viable approach
INTERVIEWER:  Will that include GST top-ups?
PRIME MINISTER:  Good morning Michael. 
SHORTEN:  Well, there are positives in this agreement too, for our farmers, for our steel industry, for our higher education sector
INTERVIEWER:  Would it surprise you that half of the million jobs you’ve created were filled by migrants?
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all let's look at where the house prices have fallen
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it's with Mark McGowan.  They're the ones doing the assessment
INTERVIEWER:  The road to greatness can take you to the edge. 
SHORTEN:  If he kills the king, Draco will die as well. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Has always been consistent -
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  And as a woman in this country, as a woman that watches these news reports time and time again, I just hope that this epidemic is really being taken seriously
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah. 
SHORTEN:  Sarah, you know, it’s about time we buried the sausage scandal of 2016
INTERVIEWER:  OK, we'll have to wait and see then.  Scott Morrison, I appreciate your time
PRIME MINISTER:  Let me explain what happens with the NDIS.  What happens is based on estimates that are provided by the states working with the Commonwealth to understand what the expected demand is, then you pay out what the services are that are provided in response to that demand
SHORTEN:  I will get Brendan to supplement the answer.  We are not going to pick a final number but I will state this
INTERVIEWER:  They’ve lost businesses. 
SHORTEN:  The adventures of a heroic and debonair stalwart mouse named Stuart Little with human qualities, who faces some comic misadventures while searching for his lost bird friend and living with a human family as their child
PRIME MINISTER:  Wellington. 
INTERVIEWER:  That’s not my question. 
SHORTEN:  A wife questions her life choices as she travels to Stockholm with her husband, where he is slated to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature
PRIME MINISTER:  I just focus on the plan we have, the plans that we have outlaid on the economy, our national security plans, the plans I’m announcing today to meet our climate change targets and that’s what we are putting to the Australian people
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  I watched Josh Frydenberg’s first Budget last night, is it going to win you the next election?
SHORTEN:  Because I've never forgotten the men I met there and their families, never forgotten them
PRIME MINISTER:  If I didn’t know it would be a problem. 
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister very quickly, this is another question
SHORTEN:  No, that doesn't mean that people never talk to me but listen I think that what we've got to do is - the media plays an important role, people are entitled to their opinions
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s not actually true…
INTERVIEWER:  No, no it seemed very natural. 
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, that has always been my view. 
SHORTEN:  But it's interesting, when you get off a plane at Tullamarine or at Mascot when you come from overseas, whilst you've enjoyed your visit overseas you know there's things about this country we're proud of, but we don't - when we get back to Australia - when we're overseas do we talk about our Medicare system or our tax deductions?
INTERVIEWER:  No, but will you price carbon?
SHORTEN:  I think Wentworth is a hard seat for Labor to win
PRIME MINISTER:  Harry Potter has lived under the stairs at his aunt and uncle's house his whole life
INTERVIEWER:  You have multiple journalists reporting ‘multiple sources’ –
PRIME MINISTER:  No, we’ve never actually found ourselves in that situation to the best of my recollection
SHORTEN:  The adventures of two California Highway Patrol motorcycle officers as they make their rounds on the freeways of Los Angeles
INTERVIEWER:  It certainly is.  1,600ks to cover so he has got a long way to go
SHORTEN:  Grace, a compassionate young supervisor at a foster care facility, works with her boyfriend and colleague, Mason, to help at-risk teens
PRIME MINISTER:  Well as you can see, Entschy has nailed that for a long time
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  I really got the sense watching you at the National Press Club that you are going to stick a stake in the ground on this and just stand to it and not budge a centimetre
PRIME MINISTER:  I rule them out. 
SHORTEN:  They still are.  They still are
INTERVIEWER:  But he wouldn't have been there of Border Force had done their job properly
SHORTEN:  Well you would love to know what business Tim is in, he obviously is having some business difficulties already, but let me just say this on climate change
PRIME MINISTER:  They were appalling comments on the contribution of Asian immigrants to Australia
INTERVIEWER:  So, will you bring it on this week in the Parliament?
SHORTEN:  Seven strangers are taken out of their daily lives and placed mysteriously in a deadly cube where they all agree they must find their way out
PRIME MINISTER:  We have and that BAE economic study that you’re familiar with, which I know you you’ve spoken to, their estimated cost of what Bill Shorten is talking about with his reckless carbon tax, carbon target - call it whatever you like, all I know is it’s going to increase the price of everything - that is going to cost the economy around half a trillion dollars
INTERVIEWER:  I'm just trying to drill down, Prime Minister, because in fact it can't start in 18 months if the cash flow isn't kicking till the 1st of July 2021
PRIME MINISTER:  As Harry begins his sixth year at Hogwarts, he discovers an old book marked as 'Property of the Half-Blood Prince', and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past
SHORTEN:  No, I'm not obsessed by the polls.  I've never thought that the election was a foregone conclusion
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Might be grumpy. 
SHORTEN:  Well that's going to be a matter for the state and federal regulators isn't it
PRIME MINISTER:  I'll send a videogram. 
INTERVIEWER:  I thought you might have been listening in and I know you’ve had a busy afternoon, so thank you for jumping on the line and talking to us
SHORTEN:  We get into the adjectives game, what I can say is it is too low
PRIME MINISTER:  You’re right we will have a Budget, we’ll hand down a Budget on the 2nd of April
INTERVIEWER:  But no change to your future plan?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well there's no doubt we're going to prosecute it
SHORTEN:  Well he couldn't even bring it to the Parliament. 
INTERVIEWER:  Can I just tell you what they’re saying though on struggle street
SHORTEN:  Any questions about this or other matters?
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh you make the time, it’s a good head space and it’s also, you know, good exercise and you know you’ve got to do that in these sorts of jobs and I’m enjoying it
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  True, true, but you will to an extent be judged on your reaction to parties like this
SHORTEN:  Well, I don't accept your assumption it's less enticing
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, it's a lie and it's a stupid lie.  Look, there's a reason why Labor clearly haven't been able to deliver a surplus since I had long curly hair and I understand Josh had a mullet
INTERVIEWER:  Hmm, well this is Cronulla of course, the Prime Minister is a Cronulla supporter
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I think they are highly dubious.  Bill Shorten’s answer to every question is, ‘I’ll just tax you more
SHORTEN:  Do we spend too much or we won't spend enough? The reality is for me, it's not - I don't view education and health -
INTERVIEWER:  How about the environmental one?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well again Tom, that's for the Australian people to determine, I'm not complacent about this
SHORTEN:  I'm not choosing it, the scientists say it.  It's what we've got to do to stop the planet getting warmer
INTERVIEWER:  A Nation Reborn. 
PRIME MINISTER:  the 'synthetic', David, survivor of the doomed Prometheus expedition
SHORTEN: I do think that there's too much bullying goes on and by that, I don't necessarily know what has happened to her and I don't have the facts but I have seen some of the Government rush to say oh it's all made up or that's just life
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Sure okay. 
SHORTEN:  Yeah, and I said I'd come to that issue.  I said there are two issues
PRIME MINISTER:  Thank you. 
INTERVIEWER:  But you’ve got unemployment growth slowing in this Budget
SHORTEN:  The Liberals are lying about tax.  I don't want to talk too much about it
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes absolutely, because this is the stark choice; I mean when your economy is facing stiff headwinds that we are – yesterday unemployment came down to the lowest level in seven years, 4
INTERVIEWER:  Look, the money is fantastic, you know you've got my vote - well you've definitely got out vote
SHORTEN:  Well we've had plenty of administrative heads of the Labor Party who haven't ended up in Parliament
PRIME MINISTER:  Harry, Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts for another magic-filled year
INTERVIEWER:  How much of this Budget, though, is aimed at neutralising Labor politically? I ask that question because the Labor Party has already vowed to match the first round of tax cuts announced last night?
SHORTEN:  A group of students become trapped inside a mysterious cave where they discover time passes differently underground than on the surface
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes. 
INTERVIEWER:  Thank you very much. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes. 
SHORTEN:  See you guys.  Thank you
INTERVIEWER:  Dan Andrews was claiming the mantle of the most progressive Government in Australia, is that something you would like to be able to claim if you win?
PRIME MINISTER:  Not yet, looking forward to it. 
SHORTEN:  When CIA Analyst Jack Ryan interferes with an IRA assassination, a renegade faction targets Jack and his family as revenge
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  No, Andrew Robb said that you raised the issue. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I'm simply saying Waleed that what Peter was explaining were some lessons that were learned during a period of what was a fairly tumultuous time in the world –
SHORTEN:  I think the state election had a range of state issues, there is always a lesson there and we're not complacent
INTERVIEWER:  They got this. 
SHORTEN:  Good morning. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's… the non-mining investment was actually up, mining investment was down
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Well, now we’ve covered the big topics, that got a lot more heated
SHORTEN:  Look forward to talking. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well this is the business case that is now going to be developed
INTERVIEWER:  You don't want to run the risk of bringing yourself undone though, I mean you're in the box seat, you've basically won the race
PRIME MINISTER:  The true story of how businessman Oskar Schindler saved over a thousand Jewish lives from the Nazis while they worked as slaves in his factory during World War II
SHORTEN:  Six short stories that explore the extremities of human behavior involving people in distress

PRIME MINISTER:  Under the direction of a ruthless instructor, a talented young drummer begins to pursue perfection at any cost, even his humanity
SHORTEN:  Oh no.  Listen, you and I know that, and more importantly Australians know, this is a Government who is going to run on fear and negativity
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  But he singled out the Lebanese community –
PRIME MINISTER:  Well 150 beds at Cairns hospital for a start.  You know that means you won’t have to go south to get treatment and this is important
SHORTEN:  When the evil wizard Gargamel chases the tiny blue Smurfs out of their village, they tumble from their magical world and into ours -- in fact, smack dab in the middle of Central Park
INTERVIEWER:  We're into an election campaign, can you give me four or five words, what is your pitch, what your slogan? Why should we vote for you?
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, we think that the Commonwealth and the politicians should have an anti-corruption commission
PRIME MINISTER:  Jon I’m sorry, I've got to stop you there because you cannot tell those lies to the Australian people
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah I mean, in saying that, you'd support this extra $4
SHORTEN:  there is still a man inside the machine. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Very trendy to talk down James Cook and all that sort of stuff
INTERVIEWER:  Yep. 
SHORTEN:  Well, the fact of the matter is we are arguing for a change in Australia
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m sorry Jon, you’ve got this absolutely wrong. 
INTERVIEWER: …a provision that would allow for people to be medevaced to Australia but then returned
SHORTEN:  I'll certainly be watching Four Corners and I thought one of your panellist's comments that maybe the Government was anticipating a pretty tough story, I'll be watching that
PRIME MINISTER:  They decide not to live, that seems to them the right option for you
INTERVIEWER:  The Minister in charge of finances who doesn’t look after his own credit card transactions
PRIME MINISTER:  Thrust into an all-new adventure, a down-on-his-luck Capt
SHORTEN:  No, he supports party policy and that is our party policy, a two-state solution - the right of Israel to exist behind secure borders but also recognising the legitimate aspirations of Palestinian people to their own country
INTERVIEWER:  To get that tax cut though, they will have to vote for you in the election because it won’t be introduced into Parliament this week, will it?
SHORTEN:  they want to look after the top end of town by cutting services to everyone
PRIME MINISTER:  I know, and that’s what this support does.  It provides concessional loans for businesses to get through, it provides that additional support
INTERVIEWER:  [Laughter] No he’s not.  In Flinders? Ask Greg Hunt about that
SHORTEN:  A young man goes to his father's home in Maine where, helped by a public registry, he locates and tracks down sex offenders
PRIME MINISTER:  In the electorate of Longman – no, well you’ve raised the issue –
INTERVIEWER:  And thank you for your help. 
SHORTEN:  Let's go through each of those points rather than rapid fire, let's have a conversation
PRIME MINISTER:  I know that's what the Labor Party wants you to ask me Michael –
INTERVIEWER:  Let's go to that.  How much are you raising in taxes over the next decade
SHORTEN:  It mightn't be enough, I get that so - 
PRIME MINISTER:  Tax cuts, that’s what.  We’ve already legislated our first tranche last year and we’ve taken more tax cuts for this year
INTERVIEWER:  Two worlds.  One hero
PRIME MINISTER:  Well actually, we’re down on the last one Fran. 
SHORTEN:  That will be up to the Australian people, Georgie but if I am, I won't let you or the Australian people down
INTERVIEWER:  But just summing up simply, because you’ve got to get this message through simply
SHORTEN:  I think there are some things that we can do -
PRIME MINISTER:  They do not Waleed.  I’m sorry, I’m the Prime Minister, I’m responsible for implementing it and I have the full availability of the Attorney General, the Attorney General’s Department, the Department of Home Affairs and their advice to me is, no, we don't have that power
INTERVIEWER:  Well, your figures show the emissions are going up but let’s put that aside because what has happened this week is you’ve really emerged I think as almost an evangelical supporter of pumped hydro
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s it. 
SHORTEN:  They are not correct.  There you go, short answer too
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Not a deal, will you on your how-to-vote cards, be putting One Nation last?
SHORTEN:  A young violinist unravels her long lost father's past, triggering dark forces that reach beyond her imagination
PRIME MINISTER:  Every single service that's provided and sought -

PRIME MINISTER:  That it goes to businesses up to $50 million, that we’re going to spend over half a billion dollars training among that new apprentices, 80,000 new apprentices
SHORTEN:  On the run in the year 1987, Bumblebee finds refuge in a junkyard in a small Californian beach town
INTERVIEWER:  Okay renewables revolution, so it will start with what, 100,000 homes?
SHORTEN:  Well I don't hold the children responsible for the mistakes of their parents
PRIME MINISTER:  That is very important.  It's really adding value and because migration does, migrants have added value, of course, to our country
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Did he go too far?
SHORTEN:  Well good point.  We are keeping an eye on this
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  No, let's waste some more money - 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it doesn’t need to be restored because it hasn’t been cut, it’s funding is not going backwards it’s actually being maintained
SHORTEN:  A tormented jazz musician finds himself lost in an enigmatic story involving murder, surveillance, gangsters, doppelgangers, and an impossible transformation inside a prison cell

SHORTEN:  An extraordinarily intelligent young girl from a cruel and uncaring family discovers she possesses telekinetic powers and is sent off to a school headed by a tyrannical principal
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah they were down there, it was great.  Shoalhaven Heads is a top spot, it’s sort of people from all walks of life and we had a great time down there and they had a big, the fishing club, had a huge fundraising afternoon so the family and I and friends went down and enjoyed that and they raised a bit of money for the local rural fire service and the surf club and so on
INTERVIEWER:  “Your grandparents came, some of them returned in coffins
PRIME MINISTER:  Okay and well done to the Taipans last night, cheers
SHORTEN:  Well, we have a look around the world and the Americans have been able to make some big breakthroughs in some financial scandals by basically encouraging some of the people involved to be able to come forward and get a reward
INTERVIEWER:  So you wouldn't rule out subsidies?
SHORTEN: Great to be on the show. 
PRIME MINISTER:  All of what you've said is untrue.  Let me explain why
INTERVIEWER:  Well, in Victoria they are calling it the Danslide, the weekend election result that saw the Liberal Party receive an absolute drubbing, rewarding Daniel Andrews another term as Premier
PRIME MINISTER:  No, they abolished taxes at the same time, Leigh.  They actually lessened the overall individual tax burden on Australians
SHORTEN:  No, no, hang on, Leigh.  You keep characterising my policies -
INTERVIEWER:  A lot of people watching us are involved in small business
SHORTEN:  We're certainly more progressive than the current government in Canberra
PRIME MINISTER:  They’ll be working closely with us to identify those, thanks very much, thanks for being here
INTERVIEWER:  Let me ask you about another issue that came up today
PRIME MINISTER:  Clear at the time of the nominations closing, Waleed
SHORTEN:  We're not going back to the policies of the past.  We're not going to have a carbon tax
INTERVIEWER:  He suggested that people like Kevin Andrews and Julie Bishop should be stepping aside to let new talent come through, potentially some of those new women into winnable seats, potentially
PRIME MINISTER:  You must have missed the bit that showed the difference between Bill Shorten and I when it comes to the economy and national security, we are resonating when it comes to our economic message and our national security message
SHORTEN:  A newly married couple who, in the process of starting a family, learn many of life's important lessons from their trouble-loving retriever, Marley
INTERVIEWER:  Name the comedian who withdrew from hosting the 2019 Oscars?
PRIME MINISTER:  Joe works for DFAT.  And so I am sure the Secretary will deal with whatever, if any, matters there are to be dealt with as she made clear to estimates last week
SHORTEN:  No, I’m happy if you do.  What car you choose to drive is your business
INTERVIEWER:  Well I mean I’m interested, you’re tiptoeing around One Nation
SHORTEN:  The setting is Detroit in 1995.  The city is divided by 8 Mile, a road that splits the town in half along racial lines
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, those things are mutually exclusive, Jon.  I mean, we are allowed to have reliable energy
INTERVIEWER:  Justice is Coming. 
PRIME MINISTER:  We’ve got a series, there's Terralgon, there’s Gold Coast, there’s Wollongong and there are already projects underway that we've done, into Newcastle and out of Ballarat and a range of other projects
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, we don't accept that.  This is the Government who's raised more taxes than anyone before us
INTERVIEWER:  Where does the money come from, to go out and buy the fence posts, to be able to start fencing hundreds of miles that have been destroyed?
SHORTEN:  There comes a point in everyone’s life when you have to make a decision about the direction you’re going to take
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I certainly don't agree with her on that, that's for sure
INTERVIEWER:  OK.  What's on the agenda here in Perth? You’ve been in Henderson this morning what else we up to?
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, the Government a few weeks ago said that they wanted to look at how we can break through the encrypted telecommunications of people who are criminals, terrorists and the like
PRIME MINISTER:  King T'Challa returns home from America to the reclusive, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to serve as his country's new leader
INTERVIEWER:  Do you have a view on it?
SHORTEN:  It's always possible to get airtime if you're willing to say silly things but if you want to have a strong, sensible, centrist debate and this is what Mr Turnbull perhaps missed the opportunity to do, he came in with a lot of good will, is you have to lead but you can lead from the centre
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we have record bulk-billing rates right across the country
INTERVIEWER:  All roads lead here. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well they’ve got to make it stack up, as you know
SHORTEN:  No, I'm just saying that he can make decisions which affect them now, but appointing -  this is the Head of State of Australia
INTERVIEWER:  The state governments aren't happy again with the GST carve up, will you support the changes?
SHORTEN:  No.  No
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to get into a discussion on security matters
INTERVIEWER:  You're listening to RN Breakfast.  Our guest is Opposition Leader Bill Shorten

PRIME MINISTER:  Fearing the actions of a god-like Super Hero left unchecked, Gotham City’s own formidable, forceful vigilante takes on Metropolis’s most revered, modern-day savior, while the world wrestles with what sort of hero it really needs
SHORTEN:  Yeah lovely to talk.  And it's going to be great to see some people even though it's marking a tragic event
INTERVIEWER:  The economic benefits of migration are unquestioned as you know
SHORTEN:  The infamous story of Benjamin Barker, a. k
PRIME MINISTER:  Rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker, who is unsettled by the strength of her powers
INTERVIEWER:  [Inaudible] in traffic, what you realise is how quickly Brisbane is growing, I mean Ash drives from the coast every day I did it this morning from down at Coolangatta and if you’re not past Springwood by 20 past 5 you’re done, like it’s gridlock at that hour, people are up early, there’s so many more people on the roads so it’s moving, the wheels keep moving
PRIME MINISTER:  No I don't think – increasingly - that people do think that it’s clear
SHORTEN:  As you'd be aware, Labor's been working hard from Opposition to identify how we can improve the bottom line of the Budget
INTERVIEWER:  Yes.  Look thank you so much for your time
PRIME MINISTER:  True, yep.  
SHORTEN:  Yes it's good.  It's really good
INTERVIEWER:  Oh, it can take, it depends what the original charge is
PRIME MINISTER:  No they’re not contested, they're the hard facts of what has occurred since we were elected until now
SHORTEN:  The true story of Marine Corporal Megan Leavey, who forms a powerful bond with an aggressive combat dog, Rex
INTERVIEWER:  [Inaudible] I love it, it’s great stress release isn’t it?
SHORTEN:  Up to $2000, yeah. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well for reasons that would suggest that they weren't welcome in the United States because they'd be concerned about who they were
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten, you are in Canberra now.  Let’s just be honest, are you measuring up the drapes in the Lodge? What’s going on?
SHORTEN:  No.  And let's just be clear on that
PRIME MINISTER:  Why?
INTERVIEWER:  Ok, this is 7 years.  Have you thought about cheaper ways to reach your energy targets? Will there be a carbon tax under a government you lead?
PRIME MINISTER:  I was a little bit out of there I’ve got to say but mate, it’s good to be back here with you
SHORTEN:  Well all of the research we've seen and the evidence - between 60 and 90 per cent, I mean you heard that right
INTERVIEWER:  Well, the bookies are the best bet of how things are going to play out and your odds of winning are better than you'll get with Winx at the track tomorrow
PRIME MINISTER:  Well this is the point Waleed, I don't know who is going to nominate
SHORTEN:  Perhaps if you bear with me for a moment, I'll answer your question
INTERVIEWER:  The superhero movie to end all superhero movies.  Hopefully
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I was with the Australian Workers Union, I was the Victorian Secretary and I was involved in trying to protect the workforce from the unfair blame of the company and trying to make sense of what had happened
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Waleed. 
INTERVIEWER:  I don't want to make you late for your next commitment but just finally, extending the energy supplement to Newstart seems like an afterthought that was announced by the Treasurer on radio this morning, not in the Budget
PRIME MINISTER:  Yep. 
SHORTEN:  Politicians out, independent transparent process in
INTERVIEWER:  For freedom.  For family
SHORTEN:  Dusty is a cropdusting plane who dreams of competing in a famous aerial race
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, look they’re decisions that’ll be made by investors and suppliers, and energy companies and others in terms of how they’re meeting supply to the market
INTERVIEWER:  It all ends here. 
SHORTEN:  It was just madness.  My view is that people's relationships are their own business
PRIME MINISTER:  I just go the normal quarter-pounder meal or something like that
INTERVIEWER:  If - you listed out that list of things that you would like to deliver, the issue for you in an election campaign are that voters have to trust that you will actually deliver on that
PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
SHORTEN:  A long-lost music producer finds a singer-songwriter right about the moment he has given up all hope on life
INTERVIEWER:  The Medivac thing is now reality, right? So are you thinking that there are going to be boats coming and is there any suggestion that we've seen any leave?
SHORTEN:  Look forward to it, cheerio. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Better than very slow trains, Tom. 
INTERVIEWER:  And then Friday?
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, the only way that you could follow the government’s logic is if you would stop investing in property in Australia
PRIME MINISTER:  No I think that's a bit unfair to put it in those terms
INTERVIEWER: So there’s no issue with bulk-billing in your opinion?
SHORTEN:  Our climate change plans will grow the economy, they'll create jobs and they'll lower power prices
PRIME MINISTER:  Mate he might be out there at the stadium on Saturday night, mind you he’s a Roosters fan
INTERVIEWER:  Projected. 
SHORTEN:  A Victorian surgeon rescues a heavily disfigured man being mistreated by his "owner" as a side-show freak
PRIME MINISTER:  Last months of World War II in April 1945.  As the Allies make their final push in the European Theater, a battle-hardened U
INTERVIEWER:  No, 50 murderers, rapists and paedophiles?
SHORTEN:  You can't have it all ways, you can't say when will you tell people 
PRIME MINISTER:  So these misperceptions that are out there, well that’s for them to explain
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  73. 
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s an important part of our history and up in Cooktown, they’ll tell you all about it
SHORTEN:  They have invented iView You know it is possible to do an interview at one point in the day - 
INTERVIEWER:  I just don't know how many people are going to be able to afford the $10,000
SHORTEN:  Leigh, you know there's no plans for 60 per cent or indeed 50 per cent, but I agree that what we need to do is eventually lighten the burden of income tax across all the levels
PRIME MINISTER:  Well this is what the business case does.  The business case, we wouldn’t be doing the business case on the second interconnector, if we weren’t serious about actually following through and implementing that
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Okay you have personally supported the coal industry, people might remember you bringing that piece of coal into Parliament on that occasion a few years ago?
PRIME MINISTER:  We won't be doing any preference deals with One Nation
SHORTEN:  Jack Ryan, as a young covert CIA analyst, uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U
INTERVIEWER:  The Impossible Comes True. 
SHORTEN:  First of all on the pledge, no I am not going to sign it
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that’s supposition, that’s speculation.  And what I said in the Parliament yesterday… see, as Prime Minister I've got to stay on the facts
INTERVIEWER:  But this is about people's concerns as cities become increasingly congested, people's response is not to blame politicians for the failure to deal with infrastructure but instead to turn around and say let's cut immigration
SHORTEN:  Well what we can do is we can make sure that if we are going to provide some support for the wages of early childhood educators, again we will say to the operators if Labor is providing some modest improvement in the wages of childhood educators, if Labor is providing a couple of thousand dollars a year for parents, what we say to the childcare operators is you don't get to pocket that
PRIME MINISTER:  I do.  First of all I'll be calling in the Turkish Ambassador today to make my remarks directly to him
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten, we're going to have to leave it there
PRIME MINISTER:  Well they were very encouraged and it's great to be able to do that as a Prime Minister
SHORTEN:  Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda are dead.  Now, upon the news of Detective Kerry's murder, two seasoned FBI profilers, Agent Strahm and Agent Perez, arrive in the terrified community to assist the veteran Detective Hoffman in sifting through Jigsaw's latest grisly remains and piecing together the puzzle
INTERVIEWER:  This doesn’t pass the sniff test…
SHORTEN:  That's right. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's a very good point. 
INTERVIEWER:  and you didn’t adopt that recommendation. 
SHORTEN:  That's our aim and the point about it, but just to come to that, we do need to see what numbers the Government have got
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I don't offer opinions on this, it's my job to beat it and that's what I'm doing and that's what the party elected me to do
INTERVIEWER:  Family vacation.  It will suck the life out of you
PRIME MINISTER:  Well in principle this is what our intention would be, but we’ve obviously got to see a report before we make a decision on that and that’s why the Treasurer has announced today that in a very measured process, over the weekend, once we receive that report which will be in the middle of a market day so you wouldn’t go and release it while the markets were open, the government will consider that over the weekend and provide an interim and initial, if not final, response on the Monday after the lockup after markets close
SHORTEN:  Hang on a second.  As you would know as a seasoned journalist, there is always plenty of conversations
INTERVIEWER:  Sorry I will stop you there because you are not.  If you are earning more than $180,000 a year, you are going to lift people's taxes, aren't you? 
SHORTEN:  In danger of losing his business, Anthony Roca, an ordinary man, develops a scam that will become the heist of the century
PRIME MINISTER:  Well whether it’s water cartage or things like that but I do know those $1 million is getting to those councils and the Commonwealth Government has been working closely with those councils so they can get it ready
INTERVIEWER:  Big spending, higher taxing, aren't you? That's according to the Government
PRIME MINISTER:  Hang on –
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, we've always made clear that whatever outcome occurs should be after consultation and negotiation with business including small business
INTERVIEWER:  When was the last time Labor had a surplus, in government?
PRIME MINISTER:  I mean, I was there and I say it didn’t happen. 
SHORTEN:  No.  Let's go to that
INTERVIEWER:  I’m not prejudging, I’m asking the question.  Will you henceforth -
SHORTEN:  Found inside a shining stalk of bamboo by an old bamboo cutter and his wife, a tiny girl grows rapidly into an exquisite young lady
PRIME MINISTER:  No I don't. 
INTERVIEWER:  Do you have fries with it?
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s true and the most pernicious is this retiree tax
SHORTEN:  In this animated retelling of the story from the Bible's Book of Genesis, Joseph's gift of dream interpretation and his brilliantly colored coat inspires jealousy in his brothers
INTERVIEWER:  Oh, what?
SHORTEN:  Frederick Abberline is an opium-huffing inspector from Scotland Yard who falls for one of Jack the Ripper's prostitute targets in this Hughes brothers adaption of a graphic novel that posits the Ripper's true identity
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, well you see Jon, I have a very unique perspective on this because I was the one who had to stop it
INTERVIEWER:  Long live the king. 
PRIME MINISTER:  There is expenditure now and there's expenditure over 10 years, it's a big project Jon
SHORTEN:  When Earth astronaut Capt.  Chuck Baker arrives on Planet 51 -- a world reminiscent of American suburbia circa 1950 -- he tries to avoid capture, recover his spaceship and make it home safely, all with the help of an empathetic little green being
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, thanks for joining us, appreciate your time
SHORTEN:  A college-age brother and sister get more than they bargained for on their road trip home from spring break
PRIME MINISTER:  Or Bill Shorten for that matter, by the way. 
INTERVIEWER:  What is?
PRIME MINISTER:  For these projects, so we’re just going to keep getting on with it, Jon
SHORTEN:  Actually, first things first - I am not going to spend my time bagging the current Prime Minister
INTERVIEWER:  It’s good advice of yours, to give everyone a hug on this subject, but what do we say to New Zealand, our closest friends, this will never be forgotten?
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I don't believe so at all Fran, I think I just outlined it perfectly well
SHORTEN:  There are a number of points in what you say.  First of all, enterprise bargaining was introduced 25 years ago
INTERVIEWER:  You say you don't take any notice of polls but you do have a problem with your popularity
PRIME MINISTER:  I'm not contemplating that situation.  I'm contemplating being re-elected and ensuring that we continue to keep Australia safe, secure borders, and keep our economy strong
SHORTEN:  I think you'd be fair enough to acknowledge that then, Adani didn't get the finance but now they appear to have got the finance
INTERVIEWER:  And it's not just that, but the Pride Centre is going to be a very important thing
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks Jon. 
SHORTEN:  I enjoyed the debate. 
INTERVIEWER:  Are you -
SHORTEN:  Oh yes. 
PRIME MINISTER:  There’s often the odd chat. 
INTERVIEWER:  How?
SHORTEN:  Well we’ll release our figures before the election is concluded, but we’ve also made clear that we think we need to wind back what we give to negative gearing
PRIME MINISTER:  They have.  It was bipartisan policy and the reason they’re doing it is because they don’t know how to control their spending
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Fair enough.  What… what have they got on us? Whoever did it and whoever did it, what information they got now?
SHORTEN:  The story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman and her family
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh look, Bill and I, many years ago, before we were in politics, we travelled to Israel together on a joint delegation
INTERVIEWER:  What is the economic… where is the economic modelling and what are the economic benefits of your announcement, given that migration is a very strong economic stimulus?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, what a load of rubbish.  I mean these are unions using union-members fees to promote Bill Shorten
SHORTEN:  When a car bomb explodes on the American side of the U
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  One to seven?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well no he didn't.  He thought he was paying for them
SHORTEN:  Charlie Kenton is a washed-up fighter who retired from the ring when robots took over the sport
INTERVIEWER:  Well ok, we will hear from the Opposition today about that issue
PRIME MINISTER:  Well look, I don't think you can generalize to be fair Ben, I think you just take each and every case, you apply your process, the discipline, the intelligence, the judgment and which there are very experienced people working on in this area
SHORTEN:  Mind you, I didn't think they'd roll Malcolm, so what would I know
INTERVIEWER:  It's reported today they refused to give statements to federal police, is that right?
PRIME MINISTER:  I have known Ita for a long time …
SHORTEN:  We're going to stick to our existing policies.  It's just not fair for our younger generation to not be able to afford their first home when the Government of the day is giving a tax subsidy to property investors to buy their fifth or sixth
INTERVIEWER:  How would you quantify the threat of right wing extremists in Australia?
SHORTEN:  The incredible true story behind the most controversial Italian court cases in recent years
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, in both countries where they’ve been found refugees, they’re living in countries that have signed the refugee convention
INTERVIEWER:  This is different though, through the banks isn’t it? Isn’t it banks are being

INTERVIEWER:  Alright, let's move on to something else, the ACTU Secretary, Sally McManus, has attacked enterprise bargaining as a failed system
PRIME MINISTER:  A true story of survival, as a young couple's chance encounter leads them first to love, and then on the adventure of a lifetime as they face one of the most catastrophic hurricanes in recorded history
SHORTEN:  No.  What we're going to do is prioritise, and I'll give you the key features of what we're doing
INTERVIEWER:  Thank you for your time. 
SHORTEN:  Well come along to Box Hill today where we’re going to talk more about how we are going to look after early childhood educators
PRIME MINISTER:  Raised in a poverty-stricken slum, a 16-year-old girl named Starr now attends a suburban prep school
INTERVIEWER:  Enjoy your trip to Cooktown as well and we’ll be hearing more from you as you deliver your announcements there today
SHORTEN:  Listen, I think what happened is that people just want you to get on with the job
PRIME MINISTER:  No, it’s not Ben.  So it was about the Budget, I was happy to do it and it was just being quite practical and sensible
INTERVIEWER:  Do you deny that these costings from Treasury are correct?
SHORTEN:  No.  You know I did the shopping today in Moonee Ponds where I live and people were saying bring on the Federal Election, and some people would say that Labor has it in the bag, Idon't think that at all
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes, to lower them. 
INTERVIEWER:  I saw that, I saw a photo of you and ‘Piggy’ Riddell as well
PRIME MINISTER:  We have had three national action plans now on countering domestic violence in Australia
SHORTEN:  We think that there's something that we can work with there, yes
INTERVIEWER:  Let me take you to a point that Chris Bowen has made which, if I might say to you, critically I don’t think your Government has addressed
PRIME MINISTER:  The political parties do this under their own steam, just like any company or business does
SHORTEN:  Who, Rupert Murdoch or Kevin Rudd?
INTERVIEWER:  Exploit I think is your word.  Alright - 
SHORTEN:  No listen, I've been very lucky with my team in the last five years
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I think because of a lack of awareness of our climate change policy and I think 
INTERVIEWER:  What is the problem with Nauru? I don't understand what the problem with Manus is, I mean there’s 64 professionals there, half of them are doctors
SHORTEN:  While hiding from bullies in his school's attic, a young boy discovers the extraordinary land of Fantasia, through a magical book called The Neverending Story
PRIME MINISTER:  But not all disrespect of women leads to violence
INTERVIEWER:  We spoke at the end of last year and I know that you were looking forward to having a little bit of time with your family as much as you could
PRIME MINISTER:  Local council rate relief.   I spoke to local farmers yesterday and there rates are in the tens of thousands
SHORTEN:  I've tried to ring her to find out what she meant but I think to be fair to Labor her comments have come after the last week of Liberal infighting
INTERVIEWER:  Firstly, to the news of the morning, what is your response to the arrest of Julian Assange overnight?
PRIME MINISTER:  This program has absolute support right across the party because it deals with things that Malcolm started also on Snowy 2

INTERVIEWER:  Should the Labor MP's sign the pledge? Based on what you said?
SHORTEN:  No the deal has to stack up on its own merits.  I do not support putting a single dollar of taxpayer money into this project
PRIME MINISTER:  There's no doubt that exists in Australia, there's no doubt that exists in Australia but there’s –
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten what does the floor need to be legislated, why isn't an intergovernmental agreement sufficient? That would be pretty hard to change
PRIME MINISTER:  Well why has Bill Shorten not disassociated himself with the comments of Michael Daly in New South Wales?

INTERVIEWER:  Stop the unstoppable. 
SHORTEN:  No, I'm not going to criticise Kevin there, I think he's entitled to his opinion, he's earned it the hard way and I think also, in answering that question about Mr Rudd that's the difference between Labor and Liberal
PRIME MINISTER:  On the practical issue of Longman –
INTERVIEWER:  Four or five words then, it’s; “stronger economy, safer Australia, come together”? 
SHORTEN:  Well a good analogy I've always used because when I was a union rep sometimes we'd have to have change in workplaces was quite often  I saw corporate leaders say to everyone - use the analogy of a railway station - you're at railway station A and the corporate leaders would say righto to the workforce, you've got to get to railway station B
PRIME MINISTER:  Armed with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, master thief Scott Lang must embrace his inner-hero and help his mentor, Doctor Hank Pym, protect the secret behind his spectacular Ant-Man suit from a new generation of towering threats
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Not a tip I was going to, I was actually going to say don’t wear budgie smugglers-
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah it will be, both the State Government ourselves have been working towards that
SHORTEN:  Hard-to-crack ex-CIA man, Jack Byrnes and his wife, Dina head for the warmer climes of Florida to meet son-in-law-to-be, Greg Focker's parents

PRIME MINISTER:  Dracula, Mavis, Johnny and the rest of the Drac Pack take a vacation on a luxury Monster Cruise Ship, where Dracula falls in love with the ship’s captain, Ericka, who’s secretly a descendant of Abraham Van Helsing, the notorious monster slayer
SHORTEN:  I always enjoy talking to you guys.  
INTERVIEWER:  It's taken twelve long years to get the Budget back into surplus
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh, of course.   But, anyway, the Government will make a decision and we will go through the normal processes that are required in terms of consultation with the Opposition and on that, the rules on that are very clear by the way
SHORTEN:  So I've had a day off the bus and I'll go back on the bus on Monday
INTERVIEWER:  Destiny Is Calling. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah and this helps them continue to do that and provides an economic basis for doing so, supporting jobs in rural and regional communities, particularly for indigenous Australians, who know how to manage the land and we are backing in them on doing that
SHORTEN:  Julian, who runs a Thai boxing club as a front organization for his family's drug smuggling operation, is forced by his mother Crystal to find and kill the individual responsible for his brother's recent death
INTERVIEWER:  Dark And Difficult Times Lie Ahead. 
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Ben, g’day from Perth. 
SHORTEN:  I can understand why Malcolm might say that but I have to say when you're Labor and you deal with some of the critique in the media you don't let it distract you from what's important
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Morrison, we’ve spoken to the providers, they do not have the cash flow allocated in order to meet the demand
SHORTEN:  Tom and Hannah have been platonic friends for 10 years
PRIME MINISTER:  Well no, the bill actually could do that, if they were put in community detention in metropolitan parts of the city, that’s exactly –
INTERVIEWER:  Don’t you?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's not something that the Budget could sustain and what I also understand -  you know we also have a Newstart system, we have family tax benefits systems, we have a whole range of other payments and support that exist for people on low incomes
SHORTEN:  Good morning Edwina. 
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten you probably noticed that Western Australians care a lot about the GST and you're here talking about GST reform
PRIME MINISTER:  No it won't because it's a responsible cap.  The employer-nominated positions under the plan will be maintained
SHORTEN:  Yes, I was pleased.  I was pleased for the work of Dan Andrews and his team, nothing should take way from their success
INTERVIEWER:  Look we are going to thank you for it - getting the Labor Party on board as well as the trade unions
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, Kevin Rudd doesn't get to make decisions for the Liberal Party
SHORTEN:  Let's just see, and I think it's not just Julie Bishop, to be fair to Ms Bishop
INTERVIEWER:  Is it correct the US has refused entry to 265 people from Nauru who wanted to go there?
PRIME MINISTER:  I will Alan.  Can I just mentioned one last this thing that I'm most pleased about in this Budget; that's the $461 million we're putting into combat youth suicide and mental health challenges in this country
SHORTEN:  After proving himself on the field of battle in the French and Indian War, Benjamin Martin wants nothing more to do with such things, preferring the simple life of a farmer
INTERVIEWER:  So the police didn't want a statement, so they. 
PRIME MINISTER:  A group of scientists in San Francisco struggle to stay alive in the aftermath of a plague that is wiping out humanity, while Caesar tries to maintain dominance over his community of intelligent apes
SHORTEN:  Maybe we need to have a plebiscite  - I don't know
INTERVIEWER:  Yes, I know.  Well listen we thank you for that, we'll talk again and we'll keep you posted on the feedback from the farmers as well
PRIME MINISTER:  State governments fund TAFE, Jon.  State governments fund TAFE
SHORTEN:  A fairy tale love-story about pre-med student Paige who falls in love with a Danish Prince "Eddie" who refused to follow the traditions of his parents and has come to the US to quench his thirst for rebellion
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah and in a real comparison over the forward estimates, over the next three to four years, middle income and low income Australians would get the same immediate tax hit from you as they would from Labor
SHORTEN:  James Bond returns as the secret agent 007 one more time to battle the evil organization SPECTRE
PRIME MINISTER:  That's my policy. 
INTERVIEWER:  I’ve just missed out on one of the biggest scoops of my life
SHORTEN:  First of all, there are concerns that trade agreements provide some disadvantages as well as some advantages
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I’m not going to split hairs with you Jon…
INTERVIEWER:  To another tax concession Labor is promising to wind back to some degree, negative gearing
PRIME MINISTER:  It goes much more than that.  I mean, there is a 13 week disaster allowance payment for those whose incomes are disrupted…
SHORTEN:  And if you don't have an explanation for how you're going to educate the kids or look after the sick or deal with our environment or make sure that we've got economic growth which is in the interests of everyone not just the lucky few, then people are going to say, they're going to look for more extreme solutions and just say no, we're not interested in this version of change which doesn't have a place for us in it
INTERVIEWER:  Well I was hoping for the scoop, you haven’t given me one but it's always nice to chat, thank you so much for coming on
SHORTEN:  A dramatic thriller based on the incredible true David vs
PRIME MINISTER: No I'm sorry Waleed, the bill didn't do that.  The bill didn't do that
INTERVIEWER:  A rescue pilot survived an earthquake, this is what happens next
SHORTEN:  Let's go to Citibank, they're an internationally reputable bank
PRIME MINISTER:  You’ve also got to deal with this numpty legislation, which basically tells farmers what they can do on their own land
INTERVIEWER:  Don’t do it?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I know that… yes, that have, they tried the same thing back in 2016
SHORTEN:  Let's be fair here, Leigh.  Let’s be fair
INTERVIEWER:  If Scott Morrison is the Prime Minister after the election you're saying it's only fair then he obviously gets to appoint -
SHORTEN:  Listen, the Liberals are lying about taxes.  Let's just call it as it is
PRIME MINISTER:  What Labor did was weaken our border protection. 
INTERVIEWER:  I don't think that the unions are satisfied that you can sort all of this out after the event
SHORTEN:  An  U. S
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, what we're doing for people who are looking for jobs is getting them into work
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister Scott Morrison, good morning. 
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s because they don't even know how Budgets work
SHORTEN:  Oh no you're right.  It was five years ago and eight years ago and we've learned our lesson though
INTERVIEWER:  Dan Andrews has said the Victorian State Government is the most progressive state government in the country
PRIME MINISTER:  Look, these are big projects Neil, they can't just be done by yesterday afternoon and they don't start unless the Commonwealth in this case, is prepared to make this sort of a commitment of $2 billion, which we have and we'll work with the State government
SHORTEN:  Furious that her late father only willed her his gloomy-looking mansion rather than his millions, Carrigan Crittenden is ready to burn the place to the ground when she discovers a map to a treasure hidden in the house
INTERVIEWER:  The problem is the Coalition are almost back in surplus, they are just better at managing the economy, aren’t they?
SHORTEN:  Three high school students make an incredible discovery, leading to their developing uncanny powers beyond their understanding
PRIME MINISTER:  He paid back the money and that’s the end of the matter
INTERVIEWER:  No.  
PRIME MINISTER:  Well they’re not ones that exist certainly within my Party
SHORTEN:  When a madman dubbed 'Scorpio' terrorizes San Francisco, hard-nosed cop, Harry Callahan – famous for his take-no-prisoners approach to law enforcement – is tasked with hunting down the psychopath
INTERVIEWER:  What skills specifically are they for Tasmania, that are lacking here?
SHORTEN:  First of all, they are 2 different issues. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Employment growth continues because we've got unemployment down to the lowest level in the last decade, Fran
INTERVIEWER:  No, no, no, let me rephrase because I know what you’re going to –
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it’s not legislation, it’s part of code.  What I’m saying is, I used to be the Immigration Minister, you know, it’s my signature on many Australians’ citizenships today
SHORTEN:  Of course not.  I just thought it was wrong and so, that was only a tiny taste
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Are you curious?
SHORTEN:  It's about time we had the renewables revolution.  We're proposing to make it easier for households to buy solar powered batteries
PRIME MINISTER:  Waleed let me just say for the record -
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  There’s nothing wrong with making a quid.  They’re going to increase the tax on the Capital Gain by 50 per cent
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t really care what they think. 
SHORTEN:  Well, I think Mr Porter's problem is that the Prime Minister who he supported for the last three years say's there a problem and for the sake of certainty, you're best off referring it to the High Court
INTERVIEWER:  Enter the World of Pandora. 
SHORTEN:  We'll have more to say about energy policy in the next couple of months but I think you're right
PRIME MINISTER:  Blake Redding is trapped in this dark room wanting to protect his love so the only thing he will do is escape like no failed student has done before
INTERVIEWER:  Heroes aren't born.  They're built
SHORTEN:  Listen, our immigration is one issue but let's talk about the failure of politics
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks Fran.  Bye
INTERVIEWER:  What?
SHORTEN:  At the moment they can be north of $10,000, so they're certainly not cheap
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Ben – there’s a fair chance you might be wrong
INTERVIEWER:  What will your recommendation to the Party be?
PRIME MINISTER:  Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco
SHORTEN:  Not paying attention to his job, a young demon allows the evil cleansing machine to overflow and explode, turning the young demon into the infamous monster Janemba
INTERVIEWER:  Darkness rises. 
PRIME MINISTER:  the way it works currently is clinicians decide whether someone should be transferred, OK? That’s not going to change
SHORTEN:  Mowgli has been living in the man-village with his little stepbrother Ranjan and his best friend Shanti
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  The border is just another line to cross. 
SHORTEN:  He's a vegetarian.  When a lie turns Oscar into an improbable hero and Lenny becomes an outcast, the two form an unlikely friendship
PRIME MINISTER:  In ancient Egypt, peasant Mathayus is hired to exact revenge on the powerful Memnon and the sorceress Cassandra, who are ready to overtake Balthazar's village
INTERVIEWER:  The reality is Bill, you don't actually need to do anything
SHORTEN:  Adam Sandler invites you to share some holiday cheer in the new, no-holds-barred musical comedy Adam Sandler's 8 Crazy Nights
PRIME MINISTER:  I'm seeking a response in the good faith of our relationship
INTERVIEWER:  Coca Cola?
SHORTEN:  Leigh, let's see how we go in the election first.  We haven't won and we haven't lost
PRIME MINISTER:  Income per capita, disposable income per capita, these measures show that positive position over the last 12 months and that's been an improvement
INTERVIEWER:  But you are, you have got to admit, you are pretty short on women in your ranks
PRIME MINISTER:  Gellert Grindelwald has escaped imprisonment and has begun gathering followers to his cause—elevating wizards above all non-magical beings
SHORTEN:  We haven't finalised our position, but I think that the unions and indeed a lot of people from the Reserve Bank onwards, are all saying that everything is going up in Australia except wages
[Music played]
INTERVIEWER:  Snowy Hydro 2, still committed?
PRIME MINISTER:  No I don’t, because we’re meeting our commitments, we’ve set our commitments
SHORTEN:  I think he should receive consular assistance beyond that, I don't know all the facts of the matter and he should deserve the ability to be able to represent it in court which he will be
INTERVIEWER:  No, but you don't get to surpluses and maintain them with slowing growth and slowing global outlook and tax handouts, do you?
SHORTEN:  Yes it is disappointing Lisa.  It's not the way the arrangements are meant to work
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s what the Budget surplus is next year, that’s what the forecast Budget surplus is
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister it is an uncomfortable, even sickening truth that this shooter is a home-grown terrorist from New South Wales
PRIME MINISTER:  Leigh, Leigh just allow me to finish the answer to the question
SHORTEN: Sorry just to correct, when you say controversial, some in the property industry don't like negative gearing changes but a lot of people actually do like it
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Is it an apology that you're demanding from Erdogan?
SHORTEN:  Set in 1977, back when sex was safe, pleasure was a business and business was booming, idealistic porn producer Jack Horner aspires to elevate his craft to an art form
PRIME MINISTER:  Well this is a responsible plan to manage our future population growth
INTERVIEWER:  Too little, too late, is the widely heard rejoinder
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we're building one at Hughenden. 
SHORTEN:  Can a storybook view of romance survive in the real world?
INTERVIEWER:  Lots of families will be looking at that policy very closely this morning
PRIME MINISTER:  This afternoon I will be up in the electorate of Cowan, we’ve got a meeting there with a lot of the multicultural communities that are there and I'm looking forward to sitting down with them
SHORTEN:  In a mysterious and remote snowy outpost, Matt and Potter share a Christmas meal, swapping creepy tales of their earlier lives in the outside world, but are both men who they appear to be?
INTERVIEWER:  I’m just asking. 
SHORTEN:  An Israeli counterterrorism soldier with a secretly fabulous ambition to become a Manhattan hairstylist
PRIME MINISTER:  I’ve already –
INTERVIEWER:  Well, they’re not always conservative, we haven't hit the wages forecasts for the last five budgets
SHORTEN:  Hope so, see you. 
PRIME MINISTER:  54,000, how good is that?
INTERVIEWER:  And we’ll come back and chat with the Prime Minister right after this
PRIME MINISTER:  Let me say a couple of things about the last issue
SHORTEN:  Well I like Melissa.  I think she is an accomplished woman and she was a good Member of Parliament when she was there and she's also worked overseas for the United Nations and refugees so, I like her
INTERVIEWER:  Got a bit loose, did you?
SHORTEN:  During their travel from Chicago to New York, Harry and Sally debate whether or not sex ruins a friendship between a man and a woman
PRIME MINISTER:  Well what the visas will do will say that if you have complied with the terms of the visa to live in a regional area, then you will be able to apply for permanent residency
INTERVIEWER:  Are you concerned that these comments by the President expose or open Australia to terror attacks?
SHORTEN:  I'd say that's wrong.  Our position's very clear
PRIME MINISTER:  Throw the book at them - and there are some other measures that the Government has been looking at, I've been working with the Attorney-General on this and the Minister for Agriculture
INTERVIEWER:  Now an election is clearly in the air when the Prime Minister comes to town bearing gifts
PRIME MINISTER:  They were always not going to accept everybody, that's their own
SHORTEN:  I'd say that my view on this mine is going to be based on the best science, whether or not it stacks up, and if it is, if it stacks up and passes all the scientific tests, I won't engage in sovereign risk
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  The eye of the enemy is moving. 
SHORTEN:  That's a really good point.  First of all, the government loves to say that if we are not going to give a tax subsidy to a property investor, somehow that’s a property tax
PRIME MINISTER:  We'll have more to say about that. 
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, and nothing specific though?
SHORTEN:  Yes, we will, we will support boat turn backs where it's safe to do so, which is existing policy
PRIME MINISTER:  David Johnson was there and he said it didn't happen
INTERVIEWER:  A few final things Prime Minister, why have you cancelled the dawn services at Villers-Bretonneux is there any chance of overturning that?
SHORTEN:  No that was the other part of your question, I said come back to it
PRIME MINISTER:  Okay –
INTERVIEWER:  And Australia always has been a country where we've taken care of the underprivileged or those who are unable to take care of themselves
PRIME MINISTER:  Honestly guys, seriously you are focussing on the wrong things
SHORTEN:  No, not at all.  Did you know Karl that since they have got into power they have doubled the national debt? And what we have also seen is that they've had deficit upon deficit
INTERVIEWER:  Do you agree with Kevin Rudd's assessment that Rupert Murdoch's a cancerous influence in Australian politics?
PRIME MINISTER:  Australia has had 27 years of continuous economic growth
SHORTEN:  A bigoted junkie cop suffering from bipolar disorder and drug addiction manipulates and hallucinates his way through the festive season in a bid to secure promotion and win back his wife and daughter
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Why won't child care providers just whack up their fees?
SHORTEN:  Cheerio, bye-bye. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Mate you can always do it from the stands, I think it’d go really well with the coverage
INTERVIEWER:  You’re allocating more funds for more of it…
PRIME MINISTER:  When Bella Swan moves to a small town in the Pacific Northwest to live with her father, she meets the reclusive Edward Cullen, a mysterious classmate who reveals himself to be a 108-year-old vampire
SHORTEN:  Yes 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  If you are re-elected, given the history of the party in recent years, can you guarantee to stay Prime Minister for three years?
SHORTEN:  That's right. 
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Leigh. 
INTERVIEWER:  If at first you don't succeed, build a time machine
SHORTEN:  I had a dream. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well these steps are already being taken as you’d expect them to be
INTERVIEWER:  Speaking of that, is Malcolm Turnbull going to campaign for the Government?
PRIME MINISTER:  No he hasn’t responded to me as yet.  We will see
SHORTEN:  It won't have an appreciable impact on the price of housing
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER: Is that because you don't want Julie Bishop as Governor-General?
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Jon. 
SHORTEN:  And the Commonwealth public service. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Well, for the same reasons you won’t bag One Nation, it's political
PRIME MINISTER:  Again, if you want to repeat the lies of the Labor Party to your listeners -
SHORTEN:  That's where the political debate should be - the best ideas 
INTERVIEWER:  Halloween comes to life. 
SHORTEN:  Good on you, Karl.  Have a lovely day
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I think you have made a couple of leaps there Jon
INTERVIEWER:  Bill there's some significant issues facing the world at the moment, climate change being one of the biggest
SHORTEN:  Advertising executive Nick Marshall is as cocky as they come, but what happens to a chauvinistic guy when he can suddenly hear what women are thinking? Nick gets passed over for a promotion, but after an accident enables him to hear women's thoughts, he puts his newfound talent to work against Darcy, his new boss, who seems to be infatuated with him
PRIME MINISTER:  We’re fighting this every day and Australians are waking up to it
INTERVIEWER:  Well done Scott. 
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, full credit to Daniel Andrews and the State Labor Government
PRIME MINISTER:  That's what Labor have done.  That's exactly what they have done, taking it away
INTERVIEWER:  OK, if you won't or can't give us a figure on what you are raising in taxes, well can you tell people today whose taxes are going to rise in order to pay for these programs?
SHORTEN:  Thanks guys. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well what Nauru has indeed done and, that it is legally able to be done, well we’ll make our assessment on that
INTERVIEWER:  If you're elected, you're unlikely to have a majority in the Senate
SHORTEN:  Based on the classic novel by Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game is the story of the Earth's most gifted children training to defend their homeplanet in the space wars of the future
PRIME MINISTER:  No Jon, what you are putting to me is just not true
INTERVIEWER:  If you've been a good government though, how do you respond when people say why have you needed three Prime Ministers?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it’s continuing the projects that we already do
SHORTEN:  A fair go for all.  We're going to invest in people and invest in infrastructure
INTERVIEWER:  But will it win votes though? Because you need those
SHORTEN:  Well we are putting forward a series of recommendations
PRIME MINISTER:  It wasn’t abandoned.  It hasn’t been abandoned
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Right.  So if Fraser Anning is, you will put One Nation ahead of Fraser Anning?
SHORTEN:  Because it is costing $6 billion.  The reality is that when you go to hospital it costs a lot more than $2000, I need to find money for our ageing population
PRIME MINISTER:  The money I’m going to spend on Christmas Island, I would very much like to be spending all of that up in north Queensland
INTERVIEWER:  Well that’s nice to know. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Good on you Ben. 
SHORTEN:  We talk about a strong minimum wage, we don't talk about the top two percent of Australians not having to pay tax
INTERVIEWER:  But don’t they?
PRIME MINISTER:  We’ll vote it down. 
SHORTEN:  An uptight by-the-book cop must protect the widow of a drug boss from crooked cops and gunmen
INTERVIEWER:  So on immigration, simple yes or no answer, do you want to change the way we do immigration? Do you want to reduce the number of people who get permission to move to Australia?
PRIME MINISTER:  He is a good man. 
SHORTEN:  The action-packed and captivating tale of Dee Renjie's beginnings in the Imperial police force
INTERVIEWER:  And you were in a position with the union at that stage, weren't you?
SHORTEN:  Anyway, so we get the hypocrisy of the process but today's a good day
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, of course not Ben.  I mean the election will be called, there are three dates, 11th, 18th or 25th and we’ve just released our Budget
INTERVIEWER:  Yes, very fashionable now. 
PRIME MINISTER:  There’s no link between those Jon, look Jon, if the Labor Party wants to get into those smears, look, I understand that
SHORTEN:  Well this is my sixth January as Opposition Leader and what I'm hearing all over Australia, not just Queensland, is people are sick of the instability
INTERVIEWER:  But I really worry too when you got 16 and 17 year olds, I worry whether you’re importing a problem here
SHORTEN:  Thanks for the conversation, Leigh.  It was great
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it’s a contest of both.  It is a contest about who's best to lead the country going forward and it is also about the record of our Government, which has seen hospital funding increase by 63 per cent since we were first elected
INTERVIEWER:  We’ve had a few callers ringing in as well, asking about ABC funding
SHORTEN:  Oh, I'm not getting ahead of myself.  What we're going to do is not focus so much on the Government and the personalities but on our plan for the future
PRIME MINISTER:  When a young nun at a cloistered abbey in Romania takes her own life, a priest with a haunted past and a novitiate on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate
INTERVIEWER:  Will your negative gearing policy make houses cheaper?
SHORTEN:  Four Navy SEALs on a covert mission to neutralize a high-level al-Qaeda operative must make an impossible moral decision in the mountains of Afghanistan that leads them into an enemy ambush
PRIME MINISTER:  All of it. 
INTERVIEWER:  But you were asked about whether or not workers on over $180,000 are going to pay more tax, that's true too isn't it?
SHORTEN:  You know, it is possible to do an interview at one point in the day and replay it
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks a lot Fran. 
INTERVIEWER:  When you can live forever, what do you live for?
SHORTEN:  No, it's still got a long way to go.  That would be too arrogant to just assume that the election is over
PRIME MINISTER: And those crimes have been committed actually in Papua New Guinea
INTERVIEWER:  Fair enough. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it means I'm working on that now.  One of the things I brought back - I'm going to be working Michaelia Cash and the Queensland Government over the course of this week - my first priority was to sort out the paperwork on the $75,000 for the producers, for the graziers
SHORTEN:  Seen-it-all New York detective Frank Keller is unsettled - he has done twenty years on the force and could retire, and he hasn't come to terms with his wife leaving him for a colleague
INTERVIEWER:  Bill, importantly, according to a La Trobe University study, 80 per cent of homophobic bullying involving LGBTI young people occurs at schools, and has a profound impact on their wellbeing and education as you can imagine, let alone the ongoing impact on their adult life
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I was just deeply offended, as any Australian would be
SHORTEN:  No, not at all.  There is still another perhaps up to five months before the election
INTERVIEWER:  No, I'll just re-ask it.  Does your Party and your Coalition have a problem of Islamophobia? 
SHORTEN:  We're up for that.  I mean people are sick of just the negativity
PRIME MINISTER:  No, the 2020 targets are the one we're going to meet by over 400 million tonnes
INTERVIEWER:  Now look, just a couple of things.  I trust you're on top of all of this, I'm not suggesting you're not, but a couple of things that were important to our listeners here last night which won't be talked about today
SHORTEN:  A retired pop singer turned actress' sense of reality is shaken when she is stalked by an obsessed fan and seemingly a ghost of her past
PRIME MINISTER:  The election nominations will be called, we will see the candidates and we will make our decisions at that time
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  I’ll make it brief.  We’ve been over-promised to buggery by Warren Entsch and there hasn’t been too much achieved, I’m not real happy with him, two things but – they’re probably ways to sort everyone’s worries; the flag, mate
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, well it’s true.  I mean, other services, you know, when we have the 11am services on Armistice Day, they are equally also very moving, there’s an importance about that time
SHORTEN:  The Nazis, exasperated at the number of escapes from their prison camps by a relatively small number of Allied prisoners, relocates them to a high-security 'escape-proof' camp to sit out the remainder of the war
INTERVIEWER:  Will there be any cost to business under Labor's climate change plans?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, why not? You’ll remember when John Howard many years ago was attacked for those things, a long, long time ago
SHORTEN:  The thing giving people smuggler's the best encouragement in 2018 is the constant billboard which the Government do when they say, oh if Labor gets elected, which is possible at the next election, they are egging the people smuggler's on to try their hand again
INTERVIEWER:  Well done. 
SHORTEN:  No.  And the point about it is that she is a strong person
PRIME MINISTER:  Good, Shad and Carly, it’s great to be back here and with you guys again today
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  The leader of the Liberal Party, the Coalition and Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Morrison good morning to you
SHORTEN:  These guys have got to stop focusing on themselves and do their day job
PRIME MINISTER:  I already said to you before that no, I don't think the Party has that problem, I don't think the Liberal Party as a total group has that problem
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten there are a number of tightly held seats in Western Australia that you're fighting over at the moment
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s exactly right and this is the point we're making
SHORTEN:  I’ll come to cheaper in a second, first of all let’s deal with fair, this is the real reason we’re doing it
INTERVIEWER:  Well that’s not about your tax cuts. 
PRIME MINISTER:  We're not going to put a $5 billion retiree tax on Australians
SHORTEN:  In an attempt to free himself from a state of forgotten limbo, evil dream-demon Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) devises a plan to manipulate un-dead mass murderer Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzenger) into slicing-and-dicing his way through the teenage population of Springwood
INTERVIEWER:  Meet the little voices inside your head. 
SHORTEN:  That's alright. 
PRIME MINISTER:  30 per cent of the housing market is rental accommodation as a result of mum and dad investors
INTERVIEWER:  Really appreciate you sparing some time to call in this afternoon, I know I've probably gone over the allotted time
PRIME MINISTER:  No Leigh, we’re bringing down the first Budget surplus for next year and it's taken 12 years to get there
SHORTEN:  No.  I just want to reassure Australians that despite the chaos and division that we saw last week in the Government and their inability to explain why they got rid of Malcolm Turnbull, I want to reassure Australians that what we're working on is positive reasons to vote for Labor
INTERVIEWER:  I’ll leave that for Mr Shorten and Mr Bowen to explain but it’s going to be an interesting contest
SHORTEN:  Well it’s a matter of priorities.  This is the truth in Australia at the moment
PRIME MINISTER:  If you had anywhere in Australia the ratio of medical professionals to people –
INTERVIEWER:  You're less sceptical of it now?
PRIME MINISTER:  I tend to deal with people on the issues they present to me and Pauline has never raised or come to me over those issues
SHORTEN:  First of all, the first conversation I had for him was to thank him for his service to the nation
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, but over the year to September 2018, emissions were up 0
PRIME MINISTER:  Go through them. 
SHORTEN:  We want to make sure that our defence spending is up to 2 per cent of our national economy
INTERVIEWER:  On climate change policy, will Labor put a price on carbon?
SHORTEN:  Well, we'll be pursuing it.  It really depends on what sort of pressure the government has brought on the crossbenchers
PRIME MINISTER:  Well they increased 3 percent, the minimum wage. 
INTERVIEWER:  It’s politically difficult, it’s the middle of an election
SHORTEN:  All-stars from the previous Step Up installments come together in glittering Las Vegas, battling for a victory that could define their dreams and their careers
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, bit of that from time to time.   It’s still not illegal
INTERVIEWER:  Are you ready to meet Auggie Pullman?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I'm afraid mate, sometimes you could be accused of it
SHORTEN:  A high school swim champion with a troubled past enrolls in the U
INTERVIEWER:  Infiltrate hate. 
SHORTEN:  Have a lovely morning guys.  The swimming program is really important, it's good policy
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that is not what happened. 
INTERVIEWER:  How do you reckon the Budget has been received by Australians? You’ve already had a chance to get a bit of a sense of that?
PRIME MINISTER:  No what I'm saying is that I was concerned about those fears in the community and that it has always been my practice - as I've demonstrated to you outside the Parliament and inside the Parliament - to seek to address those
SHORTEN:  What's going on in the property market at the moment is the banks are restricting credit
INTERVIEWER:  You can understand the cynicism though?
SHORTEN:  Wart is a young boy who aspires to be a knight's squire
PRIME MINISTER:  I know, I did it. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Can you repeat what happened in Victoria over the weekend?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well you can't go into the McDonald's drive through and get yourself a fast rail to Melbourne
SHORTEN:  I don't have that view.  I have made the practice over five years now of not commenting on the polls - good, bad or indifferent
INTERVIEWER:  Do you often quote Borat in the Federal Parliament?
PRIME MINISTER:  To push the crime rate below one percent for the rest of the year, the New Founding Fathers of America test a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community

INTERVIEWER:  Now we’ve got to get stuck into some of the matters of the day and of course there’s $60 million you’re pledging to build this so-called Cairns Tropical Enterprise Centre
PRIME MINISTER:  Well the election will be called in April and it will be held in May, that's as much of the detail I can tell you about today Ben
SHORTEN:  Oh back in the 80s mate, but neither government has managed to produce a surplus - the Coalition hasn't managed to produce a surplus since they've been in power this time around
INTERVIEWER:  Evil Must Be Confronted. 
SHORTEN:  In the year 50 BC, Gaul is occupied by the Romans - nearly
PRIME MINISTER:  I think there are a range of avenues open there and I'd expect people to be applying the law
INTERVIEWER:  An American tradition. 
SHORTEN:  Well no, fair's fair.  I do think that people are very disillusioned, but you can't mark me down because we're willing to properly fund education and just dismiss it as spin
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's what we'll do, property by property by property
INTERVIEWER:  What has Bill Shorten done? Is he racist? 
PRIME MINISTER:  They're supporting them in it but they just don't want, you know, people just stomping all over their properties
SHORTEN:  A New Jersey guy dedicated to his family, friends, and church, develops unrealistic expectations from watching porn and works to find happiness and intimacy with his potential true love
INTERVIEWER:  Scott Morrison, good morning. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Good on you Brenda tell your friends. 
SHORTEN:  Well I think this is a Government to be honest, who have stopped governing
INTERVIEWER:  Something wicked this way comes. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, that’s not true. 
SHORTEN:  First of all, when it comes to community sector, there was some wage improvement made for them when Labor was last in power
INTERVIEWER:  They do. 
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s a tough job.  That’s not my plan
SHORTEN:  Víctor is a child who is found casually roaming by a country road
INTERVIEWER:  We’ve got to move on because we’ve got little time and the queue starts at Mount Isa, we’ve got John on the line
PRIME MINISTER:  Really fair dinkum. 
SHORTEN: Well, you know and I know, Fran, that if we don't have the numbers, it can't be done
INTERVIEWER:  OK, very fast trains. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I'm sorry, Jon.  I'm sorry, every demand for the NDIS is fully funded
SHORTEN:  Yes.  There's already 50,000 batteries installed around Australia
INTERVIEWER:  Who do you imagine is on Newstart when you picture it in your mind's eye? 
SHORTEN:  Well, there's no doubt that it's going to take a while, but we've got to start
PRIME MINISTER:  A poor comic book artist summons four legendary Kung Fu masters to learn the highest level of martial arts and help him get his girl
INTERVIEWER:  Fantastic.  
SHORTEN:  Well if I can put it really directly, do people want a government or do they want a piece of plasticine
PRIME MINISTER: It's Christmas time and the Griswolds are preparing for a family seasonal celebration, but things never run smoothly for Clark, his wife Ellen and their two kids
INTERVIEWER:  Every generation has a story. 
PRIME MINISTER:  He did. 
SHORTEN:  A paranoia-fueled action thriller about an unsuccessful writer whose life is transformed by a top-secret "smart drug" that allows him to use 100% of his brain and become a perfect version of himself
INTERVIEWER:  If those policies were unpopular, would you have still pursued them?
SHORTEN:  Ok, but I'm happy to contribute, though. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well let’s deal with the whole measure.  A couple of years ago we introduced pretty much exactly the same measure and it applied to pension payments
INTERVIEWER:  Do you think the marriage equality debate highlighted the need for such community outlets? 
PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
SHORTEN:  I think that is one of the questions of the ages.  The member for Manila, but Jason's been our representative in northern Australia so I might get him to talk further
INTERVIEWER:  So sounds like you're not that keen. 
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s not true. 
SHORTEN:  We do think that Western Australia has had a bad deal in the past, but we've got to make sure that if we legislate to give a better deal to Western Australia, which is what Labor has called for, that we just make sure that no other state is worse off
INTERVIEWER:  I've said, this is a bigger economic statement that anything you said last night, because people are genuinely frightened
SHORTEN:  Listen, I think some of our time zone differences are absolutely crazy, but I also know that every state has got very long held views on this issue
PRIME MINISTER:  It is actually. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Every time we talk about it, we get loads of people talking about it, for and against
SHORTEN:  Hang on, you have five questions there.  Let's do them one at a time
PRIME MINISTER: Good on you Ben, cheers. 
INTERVIEWER:  Like what? 
PRIME MINISTER:  We declassified the advice so Jon, what you are putting to me…
SHORTEN:  Well, you keep going on cost.  I want to say to you let's get this straight
INTERVIEWER:  Yep. 
SHORTEN:  There they go again, the government.  They already sound like they're backpedalling on making the banks accountable
PRIME MINISTER:  Of course. 
INTERVIEWER:  And it stays with you. 
SHORTEN:  Police chief Brody must protect the citizens of Amity after a second monstrous shark begins terrorizing the waters
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day John. 
INTERVIEWER:  Man's best friend has evolved. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Maybe you might want to rephrase it. 
SHORTEN:  I haven't seen those remarks.  But I think what you said in the preamble is correct
INTERVIEWER:  Good on you. 
SHORTEN:  We're committed to putting in place anti-bulling programs
PRIME MINISTER:  The polls always say this and people say this and that about the polls
INTERVIEWER:  I was under the impression… Pardon?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we're not talking about the bullet trains like they have in Tokyo, by the way
SHORTEN:  Secure within a desolate home as an unnatural threat terrorizes the world, a man has established a tenuous domestic order with his wife and son, but this will soon be put to test when a desperate young family arrives seeking refuge
INTERVIEWER:  You say it won't drive housing prices down by very much
PRIME MINISTER:  Those matters are determined by the Party when we know what the nominations are
SHORTEN:  I think there is disillusionment with institutions generally
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  But the disability sector, it’s what the disability sector have put in their own press releases
SHORTEN:  That's good. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah the feedback I've had, I was down in Nowra this morning just chatting to people down there and obviously I’ve been getting a lot of feedback through the phones and people's electorate offices all around the country
INTERVIEWER:  Look we are miles ahead of time, we’ve still got a few minutes time so if you are at home listening this and you want to talk about boarder security or you want to talk about the about the Port,you if want can to ring through and talk with our Prime Minister directly, he hasn’t got a long time so it you want to have a chat get on the blower immediately
SHORTEN:  Lovely, cheerio. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Because our policies have been working.  We need to draw our energy from all sources, Deb, all sources
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Well Scott Morrison is the Prime Minister.  It's within his authority to choose the next Governor-General
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh, well I think the Swans will win, but I'm no expert mate
SHORTEN:  Yeah I think that there is - and it's not just the regions
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Scott Morrison joins us now from Melbourne, good morning to you
SHORTEN:  I think it is a range, I don't think it's one stereotype at all
PRIME MINISTER:  "inception", the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious
INTERVIEWER:  So if there is a short-term economic cost, you have a 45 per cent target for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, what will be the estimated cost of that to the economy over the next decade, not in dollar terms, but as a percentage of economic growth?
PRIME MINISTER:  That's exactly what we're doing Jon. 
SHORTEN:  By all means. 
INTERVIEWER:  Life's greatest adventure is finding your place in the Circle of Life
SHORTEN:  It won't have a negative effect on economic growth
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I always am and they're always very well attended
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  And we both had a bit of a tease of each other about that
PRIME MINISTER:  Michael do you mind if I finish my answer? At the last election, the Labor Party did a preference deal with One Nation that saw people like the Member for Dobell elected into the Parliament
SHORTEN:  Sure. 
INTERVIEWER:  Have you made a decision yet on the date though?
SHORTEN:  Well I actually think that people want to look beyond the next opinion poll to what are we going to do for them and their families
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it's not up to me to have suspicions and share them, it's up to me to to speak to the facts as we know them and what we can be very confident of
INTERVIEWER:  Given the economy has already started changing since you made these announcements, and certainly on negative gearing, how committed are you to these policies, and are you ready for an election that is basically going to be a tax referendum?
SHORTEN:  Oscar Diggs, a small-time circus illusionist and con-artist, is whisked from Kansas to the Land of Oz where the inhabitants assume he's the great wizard of prophecy, there to save Oz from the clutches of evil
PRIME MINISTER:  Thirty years after defeating the Galactic Empire, Han Solo and his allies face a new threat from the evil Kylo Ren and his army of Stormtroopers
INTERVIEWER:  Mmm. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I know how to stop that, Jon. 
SHORTEN:  Retired C. I
INTERVIEWER:  Still, a lot of people say it's going to happen, all the polls say it's going to happen
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we can.  I mean the last two Budgets were better - when I was standing here last year, we bettered what we said we were going to do by $10 billion
SHORTEN:  Well we've got to find out why it happened and what happened
INTERVIEWER:  It's the fourth biggest export market. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Civil War, Peter Parker, with the help of his mentor Tony Stark, tries to balance his life as an ordinary high school student in Queens, New York City, with fighting crime as his superhero alter ego Spider-Man as a new threat, the Vulture, emerges
SHORTEN:  dodgeball.  Aided by a dodgeball guru and Goodman's attorney, La Fleur and his rag-tag team of underdogs launch a knock-down, drag-out battle in which the winner takes all
INTERVIEWER:  About how he came to be in a lunchtime meeting with [inaudible]?
SHORTEN:  Well we are winding back the negative gearing tax concessions on future houses and we are also making other changes to the system of taxation, which will see that some tax concessions which are given to the top end won't be so generous in the future, and instead we're going to use that money to educate the next generation of Australians
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah I do because I know how important it is obviously to the country, particularly in regional areas
INTERVIEWER:  That’s right, $20 thousand million, I’m telling you to say it and I’ve got it mixed up myself
SHORTEN:  Well I have to let the Caucus members have a say, I don't run a top-down organisation, but I think personally Pat Dodson is an outstanding Australian, an outstanding West Australian
PRIME MINISTER:  Following the events of Age of Ultron, the collective governments of the world pass an act designed to regulate all superhuman activity
INTERVIEWER:  Man has made his match. 
SHORTEN:  Well, I've known Scott Ryan for some period of time
PRIME MINISTER:  The cost. 
[Advertisement/traffic advice/music break]
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, you have a deep connection we know to the ANZAC story
PRIME MINISTER:  And of course affordable.  And it is going to, that is going to be a big part of the mix for a very long time to come
SHORTEN:  Yeah, but do you know what? For the last six years we have been debating the Liberals
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Well done. 
SHORTEN:  A young couple living in a Connecticut suburb during the mid-1950s struggle to come to terms with their personal problems while trying to raise their two children
PRIME MINISTER:  We’ve got to get the balance, I mean these are kids
INTERVIEWER: 1, that you'll have a different Prime Minister that you'll be going up against
PRIME MINISTER:  No what I'm saying is you don't go and make those claims wildly
SHORTEN:  Well, the Government is playing catch up with Labor in terms of putting more money back into the Catholic schools system
INTERVIEWER:  We have been pretty positive in the newsroom this morning about Ita Buttrose being the chair of the ABC
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah. 
SHORTEN:  I choose to invest in schools and hospitals, reducing the aged care waiting list, making sure people can get apprenticeships, making sure that we can reduce the out-of-pocket costs in Medicare
INTERVIEWER:  Alright, we'll wait and see exactly how the cookie crumbles, how the cards are played in the next week or two
PRIME MINISTER:  Well what Labor did last week was weaken them. 
SHORTEN:  It will be a matter for the legal system to proceed, he should receive the support any other Australian citizens should receive, the matter is going before court so I don't think there is much more I can add
INTERVIEWER:  And now suddenly you’re saying, ‘We’ve got an election coming we’ve got to crank it up
PRIME MINISTER:  He was fanging it, he was-
SHORTEN:  What we have said is that we are going to review the Newstart allowance
INTERVIEWER:  Does Scott Morrison have a majority? Can he guarantee to the Governor-General he has a majority on the floor of the Parliament when it resumes on the 10th of September?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that was a matter that I understand was decided by the Department and that has been brought to my attention and I will be discussing that with the Minister
SHORTEN:  Well he already is and this is the real heart of the issue
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Will you advise the LNP in Queensland to put One Nation below Labor and the Greens?
PRIME MINISTER:  No it's for you guys to talk about.  I don't really engage in that stuff, other than to thank Julie for the tremendous service to Western Australia, a tremendous service to the Parliament
SHORTEN:  Well, I want to try and answer -
INTERVIEWER:  How big of a problem is this, do you think?
SHORTEN: What does that mean, he's not going to assassinate someone? I mean, sorry, but if you want to change the era I think the Liberals need to do some time in opposition to understand how fundamentally people don't like this
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I'm just saying that cooperate with the investigation and nothing's been sought from them
INTERVIEWER:  Well where does this business come from about you proposing a so-called ‘medical transfer clinical assurance panel’ to quote, “Provide clinical assurance on decisions about medical evacuations
SHORTEN:  We'll change that when we get into government because I don't agree with that
PRIME MINISTER:  $700 million to upgrade that project, that's what we've committed in this Budget
INTERVIEWER:  Some assembly required. 
SHORTEN:  Not at all, it depends if you want federal tax money or not
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, we’ll all be together, I can assure you of that
INTERVIEWER:  The question –
SHORTEN:  Jerry, a small-town Minnesota car salesman is bursting at the seams with debt
PRIME MINISTER:  Returning for his fifth year of study at Hogwarts, Harry is stunned to find that his warnings about the return of Lord Voldemort have been ignored
INTERVIEWER:  I just want to come back to this point, because I know you live in the undiluted luxury of Cronulla, or else Kirribilli
PRIME MINISTER:  Phillip Ruddock was there and he said it didn't happen
SHORTEN:  A hotshot Washington criminal lawyer becomes the target of a rogue security executive videotaped in the act of murdering a congressman when the incriminating tape is surreptitiously slipped into his shopping bag by the videographer, who is fleeing the executive's assassins
INTERVIEWER:  Just finally Prime Minister, I'm trying to organise a birthday party for Jan my wife and her birthday is May the 11th, should I go ahead?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it means it’s a government.  But we're not in any position to attribute that to any particular nation
SHORTEN:  I think that putting in a black and white legislation just puts it beyond doubt
INTERVIEWER:  We know that this Bill has now been delayed until Parliament resumes next year, that's a few months away, a couple of months away, what happens to children who need medical evacuation during that period of time?
SHORTEN:  We can legislate to restore the penalty rates on Sundays and public holidays that have been cut
PRIME MINISTER:  Pakenham. 
INTERVIEWER:  Good on ya. 
SHORTEN:  Set in the Depression-era Franklin County, Virginia, a bootlegging gang is threatened by authorities who want a cut of their profits
PRIME MINISTER:  There are a number, I don't have the numbers to hand, but this is getting into a semantic discussion
INTERVIEWER:  Indeed.  Alright Prime Minister we really appreciate your time, thank you
PRIME MINISTER:  Deadpool tells the origin story of former Special Forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, who after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopts the alter ego Deadpool
SHORTEN:  No.  I have got to say that what concerns me is the waiting list that someone - the waiting time that someone has to get an elective surgery
INTERVIEWER:  He's done keeping his story straight. 
SHORTEN:  I have no plans to review the approvals.  But if we want to be fair dinkum, let's be fair dinkum and let's tell the voters the truth here, all of us
PRIME MINISTER:  A man with a low IQ has accomplished great things in his life and been present during significant historic events—in each case, far exceeding what anyone imagined he could do
INTERVIEWER:  But he did he take free tickets, didn’t he?
PRIME MINISTER:  If your question to me Waleed is this - which I believe it is - do I think that every single statement by any single member of the Liberal Party -
SHORTEN:  Well, changing the Constitution is very difficult
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  So you’re not scared of the fight next week?
PRIME MINISTER:  It has been an extraordinary few days and you've just gotten back from New Zealand, meeting with Prime Minister Ardern, you would obviously have a keen sense of what it's like on the ground there
SHORTEN:  Yes, we've got to have more diversity in our media, got to hear more voices, can't just be the same old couple of large media companies in Australia
INTERVIEWER:  So, do you commit to adopting all of the recommendations of the royal commission?
PRIME MINISTER:  When Ellen, the matriarch of the Graham family, passes away, her daughter’s family begins to unravel cryptic and increasingly terrifying secrets about their ancestry
SHORTEN:  Well there's no doubt that there's lessons federally and you've mentioned a whole range of seats where there was a significant swing to Labor
INTERVIEWER:  Would you do the same if it cost you votes?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well actually we’re talking about a number.  
SHORTEN:  give in to the terrorists and sacrifice his family, or risk everything to uphold his principles - and the integrity of the nation
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Don’t answer that. 
SHORTEN:  I will let the review look at all of those issues, that is a legitimate issue
PRIME MINISTER:  A police shootout leaves four thieves dead during an explosive armed robbery attempt in Chicago
INTERVIEWER: Well the union movement has also said; “put the Liberals last”
SHORTEN:  If we want to talk about conflicting positions, let's be even handed here, Leigh
PRIME MINISTER:  I don't get into commentary about things that Cabinet are considering
INTERVIEWER:  But in all that time you haven't been preferred leader hardly at all, have you?
PRIME MINISTER:  This is a plan, an economic plan, that's what Budgets are
SHORTEN:  Sorry what was the last bit of your question?
INTERVIEWER:  You talk about people who have been on the record
PRIME MINISTER:  When a kid accidentally triggers the universe's most lethal hunters' return to Earth, only a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers and a disgruntled female scientist can prevent the end of the human race
SHORTEN:  Snoopy embarks upon his greatest mission as he and his team take to the skies to pursue their arch-nemesis, while his best pal Charlie Brown begins his own epic quest
INTERVIEWER:  Oh that’s a good idea because I’d win that one. 
SHORTEN:  I'd welcome an overdue look at the aged care sector in Australia
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, you’ll know when we make that decision at that time
INTERVIEWER:  Believe the conspiracy. 
PRIME MINISTER:  They were among those 50, that’s true. 
SHORTEN:  Fiscal responsibility is important, I don't accept the Liberal argument that somehow Dan Andrews isn't fiscally responsible, they've made some very strong decisions
INTERVIEWER:  The ultimate trip. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Debbie Ocean, a criminal mastermind, gathers a crew of female thieves to pull off the heist of the century at New York's annual Met Gala
SHORTEN:  Because for the last three years, and indeed six years, we have been united
INTERVIEWER:  And apart from anything else, if you're going to look at constitutional change, if you're going to look at arrangements in the Parliament, what about making proper constitutional change? From time to time ideas get floated about everything from the Republic to a Makarrata
SHORTEN:  I think there is a bit of a difference there Baz.  First of all, what we are saying is that in workplace relations, just one set of laws
PRIME MINISTER:  Bob Parr has given up his superhero days to log in time as an insurance adjuster and raise his three children with his formerly heroic wife in suburbia
INTERVIEWER:  Today the Prime Minister accused you of being a clear and present threat to Australia's safety
PRIME MINISTER:  In the 22nd century, a paraplegic Marine is dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission, but becomes torn between following orders and protecting an alien civilization
SHORTEN:  Well I think that is essentially Mark's judgement, that he doesn't think it is going to happen and he doesn't support it
INTERVIEWER:  Good luck with that.  
PRIME MINISTER:  I'll tell you.  The wages growth is going to come from businesses continuing to expand, more people accessing more markets investing in their businesses, because of the low tax environment we're creating for them
SHORTEN:  Super.  Thank you
INTERVIEWER:  It will, it will. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I’m pretty much like everyone else Neil –
SHORTEN:  Well, prices go up and prices go down.  It really depends if you're trying to buy or sell a house
INTERVIEWER:  So you are not concerned you have too few women?
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks a lot. 
SHORTEN:  Well, fair's fair.  In the six years that the current government have been in, Labor has been united
INTERVIEWER:  I totally agree with you Prime Minister on that for sure
PRIME MINISTER:  Well there’s an uncanny coincidence
SHORTEN:  Wow.  
INTERVIEWER:  As you fly to Cooktown today you’re going to be flying over the world heritage listed Daintree Rainforest
PRIME MINISTER:  That I personally –
SHORTEN:  Well, let’s go back to this.  When you give a tax credit to someone who is not paying income tax, that is a gift
INTERVIEWER:  Every serial killer lives next door to someone. 
SHORTEN:  It's not even true so it's not that tough to counter
PRIME MINISTER:  Sure. 
INTERVIEWER:  A lot of these wealthy individuals get themselves lawyered up and you're talking about international boundaries and international laws here
SHORTEN:  Sure.  But I actually think Sale Secondary College is also important
PRIME MINISTER:  I think once James has the opportunity to actually read the policy I think he will react in a more measured way -
INTERVIEWER:  No, I’m not in the process of doing anything of the sort
PRIME MINISTER:  In Nazi-occupied France during World War II, a group of Jewish-American soldiers known as "The Basterds" are chosen specifically to spread fear throughout the Third Reich by scalping and brutally killing Nazis
SHORTEN:  Cheers. 
INTERVIEWER:  No doubt about it.  On a lighter note before I let you go, Ray Williams who is a Minister here in NSW, we have named and shamed him today for using photos on his election posters from about 30 years ago when he had jet black hair
PRIME MINISTER:  A tremendous candidate. 
SHORTEN:  You've declined.  I am sorry if you are busy at lunchtime
INTERVIEWER:  I understand, I understand. 
SHORTEN:  No, what we are able to do is we are prioritising schools and hospitals over creating richer multinationals and more tax minimisers in you know, Caribbean Islands
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's not true either, Jon.  I mean you've got to stop saying this stuff, we've been delivering billions of dollars of infrastructure projects in Victoria and we're going to continue to deliver billions of dollars
INTERVIEWER:  Sorry, what you’re announcing today?
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s rubbish. 
SHORTEN:  Oh no I don’t accept that, I accept that what we are doing is creating fairness
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  On George Christensen, what do you think he was doing in the Philippines for 294 days? 
PRIME MINISTER:  And he paid it back. 
SHORTEN:  When a young boy makes a wish at a carnival machine to be big—he wakes up the following morning to find that it has been granted and his body has grown older overnight
INTERVIEWER:  And the Opposition Leader joins us live now from Melbourne
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it's the law has only just come into place in the last couple of days
SHORTEN:  A man struggles with memories of his past, including a wife he cannot remember, in a nightmarish world with no sun and run by beings with telekinetic powers who seek the souls of humans
INTERVIEWER:  For the future, but not for the past. 
SHORTEN:  Well whilst I'm not running for Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, especially as Michael Gunner is doing such a good job, gee the new Gunner Government was left with a lot of problems by the outgoing administration, the CLP-run people
PRIME MINISTER:  No it’s more than that, because there is the work being done on Emissions Reduction Fund, there is the investment that will be going into Snowy Hydro 2
INTERVIEWER:  But by your logic, if higher taxes in and of themselves generally weaken an economy, a country like Norway should be weak but it has some of the highest taxes in the world and yet the average Norwegian is richer and has a higher standard of living than the average Australian
SHORTEN:  A deaf woman is stalked by a psychotic killer in her secluded home
PRIME MINISTER:  After a disease kills 98% of America's children, the surviving 2% develop superpowers and are placed in internment camps
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Have you got the slogan yet? Or that’s it?

INTERVIEWER: Can I ask you a question about costs because costs have started to become a theme of the press conference
SHORTEN:  Well, it has caused havoc and some can argue the rule is outmoded but it wouldn't be my immediate priority
PRIME MINISTER:  The story of American showman P. T
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, good afternoon. 
SHORTEN:  Good, that's good.  There you go
PRIME MINISTER:  Set in a post-apocalyptic world, young Thomas is deposited in a community of boys after his memory is erased, soon learning they're all trapped in a maze that will require him to join forces with fellow “runners” for a shot at escape
INTERVIEWER:  Five years after this virtually the same proposal was abandoned, so we’ve lost five years
PRIME MINISTER:  Well you know my view on that, you and I are both big fans of Shane and he has got a wonderful family and he has been a great son of the Shire down there
SHORTEN:  We need to see the final detail.  Anyone who says that they can commit to something that they haven't seen is selling you something which isn't real
[Laughter]

INTERVIEWER:  Look, thank you very much for your time this morning, I appreciate it

PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah well there’s a couple of issues there.  One of the issues Warren has raised with me about that is obviously the lack of competition
INTERVIEWER:  So well on that, Mr.  Shorten, in the past you have said you don't support Adani, you said you're sceptical of it, and the CFMEU has issued this pledge which several of your candidates, including Mr
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m sorry Jon, you cannot put that falsehood up just because that's what the Labor Party is saying -

PRIME MINISTER:  Yes it is. 
SHORTEN:  Yes, Labor believes that we need to fund more preschool
INTERVIEWER:  Yes. 
SHORTEN:  Well we are going to review it.  First things first - I do think Newstart is too low

INTERVIEWER:  When you’re talking about, as you say 1. 25 million jobs, also income tax cuts, more spending on health and education, return to surplus, a ten year plan to eliminate debt
SHORTEN:  Yeah, okay. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, that’s actually not true if you read what the polls said today

PRIME MINISTER:  Surprise…
SHORTEN:  Blonde Betty Elms has only just arrived in Hollywood to become a movie star when she meets an enigmatic brunette with amnesia
INTERVIEWER:  You used this term “strategic port status” I don’t know if it is going to be strong enough to unshackle the restraints on our need long term for dredging work
PRIME MINISTER:  No, the Prime Minister and Cabinet Department won’t be responsible for that so we’ll make sure my real shoes are in the photo, no problem
SHORTEN:  A group of surviving people take refuge in a shopping centre after the world has been over taken over by aggressive, flesh-eating zombies

PRIME MINISTER:  Two unnamed sources, who have never gone public.

SHORTEN:  A newly possessed cheerleader turns into a killer who specializes in offing her male classmates
INTERVIEWER:  No, no there are multiple points to this, one of which is that it was warning that these people would be in Australia, as though they would be in the community
SHORTEN: Absolutely we do, and I certainly think the decision -  because it should be for the new government whoever they are, Liberal or Labor 
PRIME MINISTER:  Because I think we have responsibilities - as you were just asking me to do - that where we are concerned that people would have fears about these things, that we would seek to alleviate those fears
INTERVIEWER:  Well, the Liberals have been belted in Victoria and today's Newspoll has Federal Labor 10 points ahead of the Coalition

[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  That will harden your support?

INTERVIEWER:  And when you consider what Newstart is, it's not a lot of money so I don't –
PRIME MINISTER:  Well there's a lot more work to be done on that.  There's no doubt about that
SHORTEN:  Well Mr Morrison will have to call an election in the next five months, they have to
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  You must be very heartened by what occurred in Victoria at the weekend, it was a Labor landslide in your home state?

PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks Deb. 
INTERVIEWER:  Can I ask Prime Minister, have you seen the vision? Because they seemed to be very warmly received, these comments

SHORTEN:  We need an independent national broadcaster.   
INTERVIEWER:  I assume you're confident about being re-elected. 
PRIME MINISTER:  We haven't had that conversation. 
SHORTEN:  Thank you.  In terms of the treatment of the children on Nauru, I have been watching very carefully what the AMA have been saying
INTERVIEWER:  So there might even be the prospect that the Labor Party and Scott Morrison would work together to solve one of the great riddles of Australian politics?
PRIME MINISTER:  My break over the summer involved talking to people who were sharing with me about their need for having their job secure, being able to get home in time to spend time with their families which is why today I announced another $240 million going into urban congestion busting projects here in South East Queensland and that’s what we’re focussed on; the things that actually improve people’s lives
SHORTEN:  Well I tell you what the numbers on me were the same before the State Election as they are now, but we’re doing pretty well
INTERVIEWER:  Isn't it a reasonable - 
SHORTEN:  First of all, the election hasn't been held. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I’m sorry, Andrew Robb did not say that I did that
INTERVIEWER:  Alright, Bill.  Well you're looking alright for one hour less sleep overnight
PRIME MINISTER:  I've been saying for some time that these headwinds we're seeing around the world, whether it's the China-US trade issues, strategic sort of tensions
SHORTEN:  Yes, let's do that, Leigh.  That would be great
INTERVIEWER:  And you won't do deals with the Shooters?
PRIME MINISTER:  By the LNP, but again, do we want to get bogged down in this or do we want to move on to how we actually make things better? In terms of the individuals, I talk to all of my members and as I say, I try and lead by example
SHORTEN:  The Coast Guard makes a daring rescue attempt off the coast of Cape Cod after a pair of oil tankers are destroyed during a blizzard in 1952

PRIME MINISTER:  Sure. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  What’s on the agenda?
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks a lot Kieran, see you guys. 
SHORTEN:  Yeah you're right, we did want to see it but the problem is Mr Turnbull couldn't even bring it to the Parliament and we encouraged him to, we thought this was a good thing to do but this is the big problem in Australia and I didn't want to talk too much about my opponents
INTERVIEWER: 30 in April last year you said, "I'm a sceptic of the project, I'm not a fan of the project
SHORTEN:  Well, but are they Jon when you think about the issue that Australians haven't voted for Scott Morrison
PRIME MINISTER:  Well migrants form part of the overall population flows into the country, we don’t have a breakdown of that, Leigh
INTERVIEWER:  It’s - Prime Minister, the Labor Party hasn’t asked me to ask anything, I’m - 
PRIME MINISTER: Well it wouldn’t be the first time. 
SHORTEN:  I think that we can miss out on what's happening around the world, you know climate change and the investment in renewables is one example but I think your question is going to a deeper point
INTERVIEWER:  Well one of the sentiments we are hearing in letters to the editor and people concerned is about the franking credits and some of the decisions you've made on taxes
SHORTEN:  Well we want the subsidy to go to the parents and what we're going to say to child care operators though is that we don't want them ramping up the prices
PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
INTERVIEWER:  ScoMo, how are you?
SHORTEN:  Maybe not the lollies.  See you, bye
PRIME MINISTER:  So everybody wins, everybody wins from this project it’s not a price it is an investment
INTERVIEWER:  Thank you for your time.  Could I just begin by saying that politicians rarely get praise
PRIME MINISTER:  G’Day. 
SHORTEN:  The subsidy will be for parents.  If your household income is up to $68,000 we will provide a 100 per cent subsidy up to the capped amount of $11
INTERVIEWER:  Once it was made public. 
SHORTEN:  I certainly don't think the outcome of the next election is at all decided

PRIME MINISTER:  Under the Australia I'll continue to lead, our economy will be stronger, Australians will be safer and I'll continue to bring Australians together
SHORTEN:  The fact that bank said this tells me a couple of things
INTERVIEWER:  No, no, but are tensions being heightened? Are tensions with China heightened?
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, it is just a nonsense claim.  It is a nonsense claim and it is built upon the back of a big lie
PRIME MINISTER:  The facts say that there is there is no evidence of that
INTERVIEWER:  We know how crucial credibility and authenticity is in politics and you were the Treasurer who came into Question Time with a lump of coal talking up fossil fuels

SHORTEN:  We want to put forward positive views.  Some people say the Government's such a disorganised shambles, just sit back and buy a box of popcorn, but the point is that puts more pressure on us, because people think the system is broken
INTERVIEWER:  Before we have a proper chat we should take care of business because we’ve been saying that we’re going to do ‘Smarter than Suse’ so let’s do that first and then we’ll have a proper chat after, see how you go against Sue
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh, elections are always a contest whether it’s are in Victoria, or North Queensland, or Western Australia, we will be everywhere

PRIME MINISTER:  That's what's been done. 
SHORTEN:  A troubled psychologist is sent to investigate the crew of an isolated research station orbiting a bizarre planet
INTERVIEWER:  (laughs) Not seeing what’s coming down over the road is quite an amazing analogy because I don’t think even you could have realised that electric cars were going to be the hot spot that it is
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I’ve spoken with Peter Dutton about this and there are no issues here that trouble me at all
SHORTEN:  Well I don't buy what you are selling there, but I will go to this point, I did say that I don't comment on polls - good or bad, but if Mr Morrison, if he thinks that he is doing really well at the moment go and ask his Victorian colleagues

SHORTEN:  Ms McGowan has always said she's concerned about all of the people in detention, not just the kids
PRIME MINISTER:  Let's just get it done. 
INTERVIEWER:  That's what most of my callers have been saying to me today
SHORTEN:  It will work cooperatively and constructively.  I always had the view, back from my days representing workers in negotiations with employers, that no one has got a monopoly on having all the good ideas
PRIME MINISTER:  But they are paid for through the health system Jon
INTERVIEWER:  Oh did you?
SHORTEN:  Well the franking credits, that's still prospective
PRIME MINISTER:  They have $200 billion dollars and more, plus the reckless emissions target, which will put up the costs of absolutely everything and cost wages by independent analysis of $9,000

INTERVIEWER:  Absolutely true.  Look, this has come back this Kerryn Phelps bill
SHORTEN:  OK let's go through each of those three points very briefly
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t make them.  They’ll be happy about that
INTERVIEWER:  So under these changes they could still come to Australia? Rejected by the US for security reasons, you’d assume
PRIME MINISTER:  Sure and that’s why I’m pleased that the youth unemployment rate here has fallen from 28 per cent to 15
SHORTEN:  Barrie, is this Liberal government, this protection racket for the banks scandals and rip-offs we’ve seen, are they really telling Australians that the only way that we can have a banking sector is to have an unethical banking sector? I don't buy that, nor do thousands of farmers and small businesses and people who have been ripped off by the banks
INTERVIEWER:  So when you raised those issues in that meeting, what did you say to them?
SHORTEN:  When Russia's first nuclear submarine malfunctions on its maiden voyage, the crew must race to save the ship and prevent a nuclear disaster
PRIME MINISTER:  In the seat, I assume he’ll be out there in Wentworth supporting Dave
INTERVIEWER:  You're on ABC Radio Perth and WA and we're talking to Bill Shorten the Opposition Leader
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I can, and I'm also fortunate to have people of the calibre of Senator Dodson here and I might give him a run on the ball, but I'll just make this
PRIME MINISTER:  The vast majority of people… you know, there are more people who negative gear properties in the federal electorate of Capricornia based on Rockhampton than in my southern seat of Cook in Sydney
INTERVIEWER:  Sadly, it doesn’t always flow through.  The money doesn’t always flow through and I don’t expect you to be able to do anything about this and it’s a very specific case but Jamie has just taken us through Walgett, for example, where you’ve got money that’s been given to the council for a weir or an artesian board to help out with water supply and the council still hasn’t spent the money
PRIME MINISTER:  That our son’s could lie safely on their shores and rest in peace there
SHORTEN:  I think the nation is sick and tired after ten years of arguing about climate change that we just don't get on with it
INTERVIEWER:  Because if you were yelling at each other across the thing and you know, it’s kind of like, it almost gives you a little bit of a prop up doesn’t it?
PRIME MINISTER:  No they haven’t, because they have made very clear their personal reasons for doing that
SHORTEN:  It was a big time.  I remember, of course, that two men got killed and another two were badly burnt
INTERVIEWER: 28th of August, Adani, yes or no? On the 28th of August because it seems your position has shifted from time to time on Adani
SHORTEN:  No, that wouldn't be right.  What we want to do is have real change, because, frankly, more of the same under this government isn't good enough for Australians -
PRIME MINISTER:  Well they'll start feeling that in terms of how the intake is done from 1 July this year
INTERVIEWER:  Has there been any applications made?
SHORTEN:  Well no, Fran, what I'm not going to do is engage in that debate
PRIME MINISTER:  That's not clear.  I've heard that being suggested, but there's nothing to suggest, at least in front of me, that has occurred
INTERVIEWER:  There are a number of Liberal held federal seats that could now be in play
SHORTEN:  Well, what we'll do in our way is we’ll put more investment in the Territory
PRIME MINISTER:  The ultimate X-Men ensemble fights a war for the survival of the species across two time periods as they join forces with their younger selves in an epic battle that must change the past – to save our future

SHORTEN:  We will once we have announced all of our policies
INTERVIEWER:  A good man. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Jon, as soon as we can get it moving, we'll begin moving
SHORTEN:  This movie was followed by a sequel (The Japanese Wife Next Door – Part 2) which features the exact same cast, but follows Takashi’s fate if he had married Mina (the other woman he shared the drink with that night) instead
INTERVIEWER:  And what made you want to come back to Gippsland, to take time out of your schedule and attend this memorial?
SHORTEN:  Nicky, a veteran con artist, takes a novice named Jess under his wing
PRIME MINISTER:  I could never confirm that one way or the other Ben, because that’s intelligence that I receive as Prime Minister
INTERVIEWER:  It is a little bit about you, you've got to admit that, and you know you've got not that much time until the next election
PRIME MINISTER:  We won’t compromise it, but one thing that happened in the Parliament this week Ben – you may be keen to know –  there are a lot of these foreign fighters and now they've lost that fight, some of them think; “Oh well, I was all confused and I wish I hadn’t,” and all the rest of it
SHORTEN:  Yes, I understand that linkage.  But what I want to make clear and they are two separate issues
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten is our guest, I beg your pardon, on ABC Radio Perth and WA, the Leader of the Opposition
SHORTEN:  What we want to do, and we think, without question, the preferred position will be to refer it off to the High Court - let's get resolution
PRIME MINISTER:  There’s three dates for the election, the 11th, 18th or 25th, they're the options we have
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  There has been a terrible spate of suicides in Indigenous communities
PRIME MINISTER:  Traveling in search of the rare ingredient, “sky fish”  Meliodas and Hawk arrive at a palace that floats above the clouds
SHORTEN:  18-year-old Penny Cooper spent years pining for Johnny Sanders Jr
INTERVIEWER:  Bill, I know you don’t want to get carried away with expectations ahead of next year’s election, but if things go on as they are, you will be our next Prime Minister and I feel bad asking you this, because I think we have to ask you every time you come on
SHORTEN:  Young Shakespeare is forced to stage his latest comedy, "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter," before it's even written
PRIME MINISTER:  I think one is enough for you Jon. 
INTERVIEWER:  But if we could stick with Labor - 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I mean, people can make all sorts of suppositions
SHORTEN:  Well that's good he went there, I'm not going to complain about that, that's good he went there
INTERVIEWER:  You think we need to show a bit of love.  We need to show we’re humane?
SHORTEN:  Yeah no, that’s somewhere with the Burberry trench coat
PRIME MINISTER:  I believe we’ll see, whether it’s that or that extended life of existing stations done on a commercial basis, but it all has to be done on a commercial basis
INTERVIEWER:  There’s still an area the size of England underwater
SHORTEN:  I tell you what, the last Prime Minister or the last leader who worried about the polls, is probably watching this on iView from New York
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks a lot David. 
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, I know you short for time. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Not at all Peta. 
SHORTEN:  we are grandfathering our proposals.  Most people don't know quite what grandfathering means
INTERVIEWER:  Interesting policy.  Alright Bill Shorten, thanks for joining us
PRIME MINISTER:  Well as you say, this is not my first visit to Cairns
SHORTEN:  Six years have elapsed since Guantanamo Bay, leaving Harold and Kumar estranged from one another with very different families, friends and lives
INTERVIEWER:  I've spoken to him personally this morning. 
SHORTEN:  If you want to talk about bullying, how about that LNP trying to threaten Melissa Price's job?
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes I will. 
INTERVIEWER:  Prepare for the Second Coming. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Thor fights to restore order across the cosmos. 
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, we have said that if you currently negatively gear, you will keep negative gearing
INTERVIEWER:  My point is that-
SHORTEN:  Let's say it as it is, the Australian people are so far ahead of the politicians on renewable energy it's not a joke but what I am going to do if we get elected is we're backing renewables, we're backing the batteries, we want people to get between a 60 and 90 per cent reduction off their household bills
PRIME MINISTER:  No worries Neil. 
INTERVIEWER:  Do you want to have a say in who the next Governor-General is?
SHORTEN:  It is up to them.  
PRIME MINISTER:  No, it is a lie Jon.  Because every single cent that needs to go to the NDIS, every single demand that is there for the NDIS -
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  $25 billion is a lie, Mr Shorten, you say, but isn't the problem here you don't have a number to put in its place? And as long as you don't have a number to put in its place, why should we be confident that you're taking the Australian economy somewhere where you know how it's going to be affected at the end of the line?
PRIME MINISTER:  Aragorn is revealed as the heir to the ancient kings as he, Gandalf and the other members of the broken fellowship struggle to save Gondor from Sauron's forces
SHORTEN:  Do you know what? I think Mr Dutton should refer himself
INTERVIEWER:  Have you ever in any shadow cabinet or Cabinet meeting raised that thought
PRIME MINISTER:  A burger-loving hit man, his philosophical partner, a drug-addled gangster's moll and a washed-up boxer converge in this sprawling, comedic crime caper
SHORTEN:  Yes, for the vast bulk of people we are offering the same thing
INTERVIEWER:  Daniel Andrews' mantra was 'getting things done' and he's able to do that now because Labor controls both Houses in Victoria, you might not be so lucky

PRIME MINISTER:  Forced into exile by the English after being crowned King of Scotland, legendary warrior Robert the Bruce fights to reclaim the throne
INTERVIEWER:  So is it ten years off?
PRIME MINISTER:  I don't feel the need to have that conversation. 
SHORTEN:  Yes, but it is a development.  Also there's a Nationals Member of Parliament, perhaps a quiet achiever is what you would call him, Mr Hogan up in Page, and he's said he's going to sit on the crossbench as well
INTERVIEWER:  Your party did the same thing, I remind you, not that many years ago
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no, Jon, you’ve got to stop reading the Saturday paper
SHORTEN:  Well, my absolute conviction and belief, is that if we don't change, then the cost will be far greater than any initial investments
INTERVIEWER:  I can remember a Four Corners investigation into people smugglers and some of them that were based here in Australia and that was the case
SHORTEN:  lower the prices, take real action on climate change and ensure reliability
PRIME MINISTER:  Well-
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  As a guest or subject of commentary on Mr Hadley's program, did you yourself ever feel bullied by him?
SHORTEN:  Well I don't think this country is getting a better deal from the third Liberal Prime Minister in five years
PRIME MINISTER:  That I’ve been involved in over my last ten years of public life?
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, Opposition Leader. 
PRIME MINISTER:  We can do more than one thing at a time.  We’re investing
SHORTEN:  In the future, a strange fungus has changed nearly everyone into a thoughtless, flesh-eating monster
INTERVIEWER:  DTs or boardies?
SHORTEN:  Well I think you've got to work on that.  We've got to make the kids safe
PRIME MINISTER:  You also said Peter was talking about the comment made by the Greens Senator
INTERVIEWER:  The city shines brightest at night. 
SHORTEN:  Yeah.  I would pick a more positive number than costs
PRIME MINISTER:  …government over the last five, I know your point is-
INTERVIEWER:  Good on you, so $40 a script now?
SHORTEN:  Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt return as heads of the Baker family who, while on vacation, find themselves in competition with a rival family of eight children, headed by Eugene Levy,
PRIME MINISTER:  In the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hideout on the Mexican border
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, I take from what you said that you've got a fair idea who's responsible and you don't want to say it, is that right?
PRIME MINISTER:  I’ll let you finish, I apologise. 
SHORTEN:  There will be no change to existing investors. 
INTERVIEWER:  And then we ended up with the extremist political parties coming in who seem to be getting all the airtime
SHORTEN:  Yes.  I mean, the Prime Minister, you said something that he said which deserves answering and this is the first occasion I've had to answer it since his remarkable press conference
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah it is just … so we're there, that's the commitment I made
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, okay. 
SHORTEN:  Well all the research and science and experts make it clear that the more early years learning we can give our kids before they go to school, it just absolutely, quantum improves their learning experience at schools
PRIME MINISTER:  Because the country they're going to live in for the next 10 years is going to be determined by this election
INTERVIEWER:  The current intake is not much above 160,000, that’s the new cap you're announcing
SHORTEN:  The place would erupt if if they rolled him.  
PRIME MINISTER:  He was a backbencher and remains a backbencher in the Government –
INTERVIEWER:  Justice or revenge. 
SHORTEN:  A tough Russian policeman is forced to partner up with a cocky Chicago police detective when he is sent to Chicago to apprehend a Georgian drug lord who killed his partner and fled the country
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it is Alan.  I couldn't agree with you more on this, I mean frankly, they want to tell you what car to drive? This will put up the price of everything, it comes down to that
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten, just in the last few moments, we have been hearing from your Deputy, Tanya Plibersek, who said about the Gilmore preselection that Warren Mundine has been very clear for the last 20 or 30 years that he wants a seat in Parliament, and he will take any party that will have him
SHORTEN:  To the best of my knowledge, no Labor candidate believes three year old child care is a political conspiracy
PRIME MINISTER:  Well because we’ve had to wind back the deficits of Labor and get the budget back into balance
INTERVIEWER:  Not here
SHORTEN:  We will in principle.  I mean it would have to be a pretty amazing reason not to
PRIME MINISTER:  Pass. 
INTERVIEWER:  So you don't know who did it?
PRIME MINISTER:  Should we ignore the fact that if there are persons who do have those records, or for whom those issues are present, that we should ignore that?
SHORTEN:  Of course. 
INTERVIEWER:  But is that happening? Especially when, with that track record … I'm trying to draw you on whether or not that track record is a problem and I haven’t -
SHORTEN:  Well, if you think we're catching, if you think that we are hearing all of the insider deals that go on well I don’t share that view
PRIME MINISTER:  Which was abominable. 
INTERVIEWER:  All these figures of course are contested by your opponents
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks a lot, Michael. 
SHORTEN:  Sherlock Holmes and Dr.  Watson find themselves in 1890s London in this holiday special
INTERVIEWER:  It’s coming up this weekend, you’re going to be out there in far north Queensland in the heat and the humidity
SHORTEN:  After defeating Frieza, Goku returns to Earth and goes on a camping trip with Gohan and Krillin
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, whether it is or whether it isn’t is not really my concern
INTERVIEWER: Malcom Turnbull said you can’t wave off the revelations about Peter Dutton’s private [inaudible] as the bubble and the buck stops with you
PRIME MINISTER:  Kids like Segways and these things, I mean Segways are important tools for people with disabilities
SHORTEN:  And it didn't exist before we got there but I spent a lot of time talking to people with disability and their careers and then we built up a coalition of people who really wanted to see a better deal
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister you mention no preference deals, but the –
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day. 
SHORTEN:  If you don’t start – you are quite right, and what sort of world are we passing on to the next generation? We know this government is paralysed on climate change, and if they weren’t, Malcolm Turnbull would still be the Prime Minister, wouldn’t he?
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, we've only got a minute to the news
SHORTEN:  As America's stock of athletic young men is depleted during World War II, a professional all-female baseball league springs up in the Midwest, funded by publicity-hungry candy maker Walter Harvey (Garry Marshall)
PRIME MINISTER:  Well all of it. 
INTERVIEWER:  There’s the camera, what do you say to the Australian people? Coal is going to be a part of mix
SHORTEN:  First of all it’s a silly policy and it’s a policy that isn't going to happen
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Gareth, it's great to be here the west. 
INTERVIEWER:  So that's why you're in Gippsland today but I want to ask you about this education funding as well
SHORTEN:  I think we are, but I think some of the shenanigans at the top level and the personality conflicts has left people disillusioned, but the way we will get around that is that we'll just go back to a more independent process to pick the senior leadership of the ABC
PRIME MINISTER:  A timid and reclusive 18-year-old high school student is alienated by her parents and ruthlessly rejected by her peers
INTERVIEWER:  Cheers. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I am pleased to be here with you today. 
SHORTEN:  We've said that we don't want to see any Commonwealth tax-payer money directly or indirectly go into it, we've seen the missed deadlines, we're sceptics
INTERVIEWER:  Okay.  Just to use language that people can understand, the number of permanent residents is what you're talking about here
PRIME MINISTER:  We actually are delivering tax cuts.  We've already legislated tax cuts
SHORTEN:  We want to try and get things done in the Parliament - that's why we're going to keep pushing for a national anti-corruption commission
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, thank you very much. 
SHORTEN:  Complete strangers stranded at a remote desert motel during a raging storm soon find themselves the target of a deranged murderer
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it's a Western Australian state government issue, it's not it's not necessarily a Federal Government issue
INTERVIEWER:  This is a very natural couch setting that we’ve set up for you
SHORTEN:  That's an issue for a plebiscite.  
PRIME MINISTER:  After sparing a girl's life during a massacre, an elite Triad assassin is targeted by an onslaught of murderous gangsters
INTERVIEWER:  [inaudible]
PRIME MINISTER:  Well the points test will give them incentives if they want permanent residence to remain in these locations
SHORTEN:  Well we set up the National Disability Insurance Scheme when I was last in government
INTERVIEWER:  Only in relation to the Lebanese community?
SHORTEN:  Yeah, sure.  
PRIME MINISTER:  He has paid. 
INTERVIEWER:  There seems to be an annual debate about Australia Day and whenever that debate comes up I think about issues like those young girls and think well this is what we really should be talking about
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no. 
SHORTEN:  The Wishbone family is far from happy.  With a struggling bookshop, an overworked husband, and two misunderstood teenagers, Emma is at her wit's end trying to be the perfect mom
INTERVIEWER:  Not man.  Not machine
SHORTEN:  I'm confident, based on the economic reforms that we've engaged in in Opposition, that we will a very positive position on surplus over the four years, and a much better position than the Liberals over the 10 years, because we're winding back unsustainable tax subsidies at the top end, which in fact the Government want to keep
PRIME MINISTER:  Thank you very much Michaelia.  This is part of our plan for a stronger economy
INTERVIEWER:  All right and so hopefully some change or potential change on that front and finally onto China and the coal issues do you think it is believable what they have said in relation to environmental checks for our coal given the standard of our exported coal is better than most of the rest of the world and yet exports from Indonesia, Russia are still going in to that port of Dalian in China is their reason believable?
SHORTEN:  No.  I've written to Mr Morrison - this is all pretty fast moving as you’d appreciate -  what I have written to Mr Morrison is a letter where I congratulate him, but I've also read media reports that they are rushing to appoint a new Governor-General, although the existing Governor-General's term doesn't finish until the end of March next year
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes, I have and I’m very satisfied. 
INTERVIEWER:  Thanks very much for coming in.  I appreciate it
SHORTEN:  No, that's right.  Someone's got to have the courage to stand up for the next generation, that's what we will do
PRIME MINISTER:  And as a result - you know, what I should be focusing on, only frankly, at the moment is dealing with these issues in north Queensland not having to reopen a detention centre on Christmas Island because Bill Shorten the Labor Party wanted to go and crash border protection in this country
INTERVIEWER:  If you see me walking the halls of Canberra, I’m having a look
PRIME MINISTER:  Good to be there Fran, good to be here. 
SHORTEN:  Yes.  So I think the Government doesn't want to have an election, but on the other hand I think the people of  Australia are feeling quite left out of all the decisions that have been happening recently
INTERVIEWER:  A report in the paper today states the McKibbin report estimates that it would cost businesses $25 billion by 2030 to buy the foreign carbon credits
SHORTEN:  Nothing at all, all I'm saying is that when we talk about fiscal management what happens in Australia is that it's not the politicians who drive for good fiscal outcomes in Australia it is the companies, it's the people who go to work
PRIME MINISTER:  When a down-to-earth Chicago baker and a soon-to-be princess discover they look like twins, they hatch a Christmastime plan to trade places
INTERVIEWER:  Does a very positive position on surplus mean you anticipate staying in surplus?
PRIME MINISTER:  I'm not suggesting you are.  So we don't have any information, I don't have any information that would enable me to make that claim
SHORTEN:  And did you know since then - what is it? 5,420 marriages have occurred
INTERVIEWER:  As I said, I'd like viewers to try and understand the basic facts as well as the politics
SHORTEN:  Well, if they have a surplus we think this is a good thing but it's because there's increased taxation on companies
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, we didn’t change the border policy.  What Labour did in the Parliament was change the policy and the setting
INTERVIEWER:  A lot to play for. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I offered her one when I became Prime Minister and she decided she didn’t want to proceed with it at that time, so I respect her decision
SHORTEN:  An American pilot is sent to a Chinese province to teach a crew of would-be pilots how to fly war planes against the Japanese during World War II
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Let me finish the question.  Let me finish -
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I accept that some of the unions would rather that we handled it in a different way –
PRIME MINISTER:  An elephant. 
INTERVIEWER:  Not all of them, but most of them today have saying; “Well you know, when I went through my own cancer battle, I didn't pay for any of this stuff”
SHORTEN:  This all-female horror anthology features four dark tales from four fiercely talented women
PRIME MINISTER:  The great mistakes that is often made it that you just throw buckets of money into state government programs and they produce results
INTERVIEWER:  Couldn’t that be the risk though, the reward.  It could be quite large, it could be as much as $200,000 in big cases - could that lead to vexatious claims?
SHORTEN:  It was a relief.  That was the point
PRIME MINISTER:  Cabinet hasn't made a decision on this matter yet and we are considering these matters and when we have made a decision we will make an announcement
INTERVIEWER:  You should know some of this now though, what you are raising in negative gearing and capital gains tax, what you’re doing in franking credits, so could you give us a figure over if not the next 10 years, over the next four years as to what you expect to raise
SHORTEN:  Baby Bink couldn't ask for more; he has adoring (if somewhat sickly-sweet) parents, he lives in a huge mansion, and he's just about to appear in the social pages of the paper
PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
INTERVIEWER:  The Prime Minister is on the line, Prime Minister good morning
SHORTEN:  No, it was everyone.  It was a collective effort
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks a lot.  Good to be here and thanks for having me on
INTERVIEWER:  What is the difference for small business and farmers?
SHORTEN:  Coal and our gas are important industries going forward
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, the Labor Party’s answer to every question, Bills Shorten’s answer to every question is higher taxes
INTERVIEWER:  Does Australia have an Islamophobia problem?
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh sorry. 
SHORTEN:  Well, you'd have to say that we're on board somewhat reluctantly
INTERVIEWER:  What is 176 minus 86?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well they stood out in the crowd.  I’ve had them for a very long time
SHORTEN:  Sorry about that Lisa. 
INTERVIEWER:  Good on you.  Good to talk to you, thank you for your time
SHORTEN:  No, I haven’t quite got around to that. 
PRIME MINISTER:  At the end of the day those calls will be made primarily made by State Government
INTERVIEWER:  Well I'll tell you what he wasn't doing, he wasn't doing his job
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I think there's a common-sense response to that, to be mindful of the nature of these comments and to await further advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
SHORTEN:  A look behind the scenes at Bernie Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme, how it was perpetrated on the public and the trail of destruction it left in its wake, both for the victims and Madoff's family
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  No, but it may take a century to recover from that situation
PRIME MINISTER:  I don't want to hand out anything.  I just want people to keep more of what they earn Fran, that's what tax relief is
SHORTEN:  Graced with a velvet voice, 21-year-old Violet Sanford heads to New York to pursue her dream of becoming a songwriter only to find her aspirations sidelined by the accolades and notoriety she receives at her "day" job as a barmaid at Coyote Ugly
INTERVIEWER:  Can I ask you about the latest Newspoll 47 out of 53 you are still six points behind after the last fortnight in Parliament are you disappointed that there hasn’t been some kind of improvement there?
PRIME MINISTER:  No mate I’m here in Sydney and it’s nice to be back home after a big week down there Canberra with the Budget
SHORTEN:  Arthur is a spirited ten-year old whose parents are away looking for work, whose eccentric grandfather has been missing for several years, and who lives with his grandmother in a country house that, in two days, will be repossessed, torn down, and turned into a block of flats unless Arthur's grandfather returns to sign some papers and pay off the family debt
[FEED DROPS OUT]
INTERVIEWER:  When you say you're not for turning, there will be no tweaking of the policy at all?
PRIME MINISTER:  As I was just mentioning, it’s 39 stops and we’re looking forward to that program and we’ve ensured it can go the full distance
SHORTEN:  Well good point.  I think back in 2004, the then Labor Party in Parliament felt a bit stampeded
INTERVIEWER:  You could win, you could a win a vote here. 
PRIME MINISTER:  We’ll go through the normal process of setting those Leigh, I’ve always been very available to 7
SHORTEN:  How does that help keep us safe and strong?
[Laughter]

SHORTEN:  High School student David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) has a talent for hacking
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks guys. 
INTERVIEWER:  100 per cent.  Well don’t forget, make sure some of that money keeps coming up here
SHORTEN:  That's Kevin's opinion.  What I'm going to do is -
PRIME MINISTER:  I’ve just answered the question as to how we're going to conduct ourselves in relation to preferences
INTERVIEWER:  Every dog happens for a reason. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's for Australian to decide, but what I believe they’re looking for is for unemployment to stay low, for investments in infrastructure and investment in services – as I said – already, 60 per cent increases in funding for hospitals and for schools
SHORTEN:  A young soldier faces profound disillusionment in the soul-destroying horror of World War I

SHORTEN:  Thank you very much. 
PRIME MINISTER:  We say kia kaha, which is Maori for “stay strong”

INTERVIEWER:  Does it bother you when you see –
SHORTEN:  We are up for reviewing it and we want to review it positively
PRIME MINISTER:  That will be made known at the time, once we see all the nominations
INTERVIEWER:  Let me ask you about the reports out today about this Chinese company that is backed by the Chinese government wanting to build a massive new coal fired power plant in the Hunter Valley
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m sorry Jon, I’m going to do a fact check on you okay
SHORTEN:  But we got the right outcome.  That day, in front of the State Library was awesome
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Oh, a Scalextric electric car set? He might have been talking about them
PRIME MINISTER:  I'll give you a good example.  The comments you've referred to in relation to Peter  when he talked about the immigration period in the 1980s
SHORTEN:  Slightly disturbed and painfully shy Angela Baker is sent away to summer camp with her cousin
INTERVIEWER:  I’m sorry to turn you around here, thank you for that point
PRIME MINISTER:  Snowy Hydro 2, absolutely, totally. 
SHORTEN:  Undercover Las Vegas police officer Vincent Downs is caught in a high stakes web of corrupt cops and the mob-controlled casino underground
INTERVIEWER:  There's been a big myth-understanding. 
SHORTEN:  It doesn't matter if it's a union who comes to me or a business, an environmental activist
PRIME MINISTER:  No, none.  I think last time I was on the program I said the same thing
INTERVIEWER:  In regards to assault, or in regards to hate speech?
PRIME MINISTER:  There was that oversight which had been identified and he fixed it up
SHORTEN:  The story of a young man who arrives in Hollywood during the 1930s hoping to work in the film industry, falls in love, and finds himself swept up in the vibrant café society that defined the spirit of the age
INTERVIEWER:  So if it comes down to it that could be enough-
PRIME MINISTER:  No, that –
SHORTEN:  See you. 
INTERVIEWER:  But hypothetically, would you think about putting heat lamps in the bathroom?
PRIME MINISTER:  This is Geelong to Melbourne, the Fast Rail.  The Melbourne Airport Link, that's already happening, we're moving ahead on it
SHORTEN:  Follows a young man named Albert and his horse, Joey, and how their bond is broken when Joey is sold to the cavalry and sent to the trenches of World War One
INTERVIEWER:  Correct.  We will be talking to someone later on to actually talk about the financial impact that marriage equality has had
PRIME MINISTER:  I've said what I've said, Neil.  That's a very specific wording I've used
SHORTEN:  Well, far be it from me to judge the Turnbull legacy but I think that this is another opportunity that he missed
INTERVIEWER:  To those people that, either in the past have strayed, or find it hard to go as hard as they may have in previous years, what do you say not to the paid-up and proud members of the Liberal Party, but the person who has voted more than not for the Liberal Party, about why they should fight just as hard in the next couple of months, as they did six years ago?
PRIME MINISTER:  All I'm simply saying is that social media is often weaponised
SHORTEN:  Three detectives in the corrupt and brutal L. A
INTERVIEWER:  It's all about to kick off. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we’re just going to make that point really clear Ben and you’re right
SHORTEN:  Well, some people say that to me.  But with the division and the instability of the government, the fact that the Liberals sacked Malcolm Turnbull nine weeks ago, then they have got to send him to Bali to clean up the new Prime Minister's foreign policy mess, the chaos has got to end
INTERVIEWER:  Go and get the cap on, we’ll see you next time. 
SHORTEN:  Rodney Copperbottom is a young robot inventor who dreams of making the world a better place, until the evil Ratchet takes over Big Weld Industries
PRIME MINISTER:  This is in the Budget, this is in the Budget papers and the funding is there
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Sorry, the business case?
PRIME MINISTER:  In Norway on 22 July 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik murdered 77 young people attending a Labour Party Youth Camp on Utöya Island outside of Oslo
SHORTEN:  I think we're competitive but we're not arrogant.  When I come to Western Australia I don't look at Liberal Western Australians and Labor Western Australians or you know, Independent Western Australians - I just see Western Australians
INTERVIEWER:  That's really good, but -
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I think –
SHORTEN:  No, not at all.  What’s happening now is that this government is raising record taxes and they spend it on property investors on their sixth house with negative gearing
INTERVIEWER:  Here she comes now by the way PM you are playing for Brenda from Aspley so if you beat-
SHORTEN:  listen, you're the reason why the vote is going to go down
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's how the economy grows; small and family businesses employ people, they invest, they develop new products, they open new stores
INTERVIEWER:  No. 
SHORTEN:  Well, we've been doing a lot of hard work in the last five years as a united and stable opposition
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes, it’s about that for both projects. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  It’s one nil to the Prime Minister.  Name the comedian who withdrew from the hosting the 2019 Oscars
SHORTEN:  We've already said that we would put money back into the Catholic and non-government system but Labor believes in education
PRIME MINISTER:  Doesn’t it sound odd that that report -
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Alright well Prime Minister Scott Morrison thank you so much for your time, really appreciate you dropping in
PRIME MINISTER:  Look, Jeff can make those comments.  But I actually quite like the fact that we’ve got a blend of experience and new people in the team
SHORTEN:  Twenty-eight-year-old Georgia is convinced the man of her dreams is "the one that got away" back in high school
INTERVIEWER:  Pat Dodson? 
SHORTEN:  Based on a true story set in pre-war Japan, a man and one of his servants begin a torrid affair
PRIME MINISTER:  Well what I am saying is since I have become Prime Minister the record of actually seeing women come into the ranks in very, very strong seats for the Liberal Party has been pretty good
INTERVIEWER:  Major contract goes from a government department to a …
PRIME MINISTER:  Seasoned musician Jackson Maine discovers — and falls in love with — struggling artist Ally
SHORTEN:  Well, there's two ingredients, aren't there? First of all, there's permanent migration
INTERVIEWER:  Just quickly, if the Coalition loses the election do you commit to staying on as leader of the party and therefore opposition leader?
SHORTEN:  I have only read what you read.  Mr Assange is entitled to his day in court
PRIME MINISTER:  An American-born Chinese economics professor accompanies her boyfriend to Singapore for his best friend's wedding, only to get thrust into the lives of Asia's rich and famous
INTERVIEWER:  Okay so will the ends, you know, the various spending programmes you outlined or Josh Frydenberg outlined, will they win you the election?
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah that’s a very polite and kind way of putting it
SHORTEN:  Well first of all you know that we’ve offered Channel Nine the opportunity to do it through the Press Club
INTERVIEWER:  Perception is everything in politics, and three ministers quitting gives voters the perception of rats deserting a sinking ship
SHORTEN:  we won't be spending as a company director, money chasing votes when they need to go to repay the taxpayers and the workers what they are owed to begin with
PRIME MINISTER: We all stand with people with cancer, I mean we've got $9 billion of funding going towards 130 separate drugs under the affordable medicines program, the Pharmaceutical Benefit scheme
INTERVIEWER:  No, no, no, but what I want you to do is try to do it - 
SHORTEN:  I don't see how that's possible.  We'll have to see what the Government is thinking and they need to consult on the terms of reference
PRIME MINISTER:  No, Andrew Robb is not one of those. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Now you are in Melbourne today to make this announcement
SHORTEN:  A Muslim ambassador exiled from his homeland, Ahmad ibn Fadlan finds himself in the company of Vikings
PRIME MINISTER:  …on border protection I don’t trade.   It’s absolute
INTERVIEWER:  You’re back into it. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well Shane sent me a text actually and let me know he was doing this
SHORTEN:  The evil Dr.  Kochin uses the dragon balls to resurrect his mentor, Dr
INTERVIEWER:  So next time –
SHORTEN:  White Castle hamburgers.  Both guys are at a crossroads, about to make major decisions that will affect the course of their lives
PRIME MINISTER:  Earth is peaceful following the Tournament of Power
INTERVIEWER:  It’s self-explanatory you didn’t really need to explain it
SHORTEN:  It's not a simple yes or no issue.  If we can take people in based upon our infrastructure, based upon the moving to the regions that's a plus
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh, occasionally yeah. 
INTERVIEWER:  I’m not smarter than Suse either. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No I’m not at all, I’d like to be informed by the work that we will do
SHORTEN:  Benjamin, a young German computer whiz, is invited to join a subversive hacker group that wants to be noticed on the world's stage
INTERVIEWER:  You could build a dam. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Since I became leader I think it is now 19 women that have now been selected in the both the Senate and in the House and Wendy has already joined us, taking over from David Bushby's position in Tasmania
SHORTEN:  Well, I don’t accept that.  First of all, the idea that the environment and the economy are two separate planets and separate solar systems is rubbish
INTERVIEWER:  All He Needed Was a Way Out. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, we have a process in place for that.  We’ve made no announcements on that process Fran, so I’m not going to pre-judge that
SHORTEN:  In the year 10,191, the world is at war for control of the desert planet Dune – the only place where the time-travel substance 'Spice' can be found
INTERVIEWER:  Okay.  Well let me be perhaps, more focused in the way I want to ask this
SHORTEN:  Well I  think that successive governments over the decades have tried to tackle this issue of big cities being overcrowded
PRIME MINISTER:  When I decide to go out to the Governor-General, the people will see that car drive to Yarralumla
INTERVIEWER:  But since you, Prime Minister, no, let me ask this question
PRIME MINISTER:  No sorry, you raised the issue, so let me address it
SHORTEN:  Fairness.  We think that Australia Day is about Australian values
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, Bill Shorten well it's good to see you in the mothership in Canberra- 
SHORTEN:  Valerie is in love with a brooding outsider, Peter, but her parents have arranged for her to marry another man – who is wealthy
PRIME MINISTER:  They're going to tell farmers, pastoralists and graziers what they can do on their land
INTERVIEWER:  Well it’s spending our dollars to give the dollars though
SHORTEN:  Ben Campbell is a young, highly intelligent, student at M
PRIME MINISTER:  I haven’t changed the policy on that.  The Labour party have sought to change it by effectively abolishing offshore processing by what they did in the Parliament
INTERVIEWER:  We're joined from Canberra by the Prime Minister Scott Morrison
SHORTEN:  Thank you. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I'll be consulting with my own Party organisation, I won't be doing it through your program
INTERVIEWER:  So you are a bit behind on that?
PRIME MINISTER:  Andrew Robb –
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I don't know where the Government thinks they get the money they spend from
INTERVIEWER:  But it does exist and a lot of people have relied on it for a long time and you are copping some backlash over this - the government is making quite something of it - are you prepared to have another look at it?
SHORTEN:  There's a couple of big hypotheticals there aren't there, Lisa
PRIME MINISTER:  No we’ll be back in the black in 2019/20, that’s what the Budget is, it’s 2019/20
INTERVIEWER:  Alright, Susan O’Neill up against the Prime Minister you’ve got 30 seconds on the clock and your time starts now
SHORTEN:  Yes, I am confident that we have got positive policies and we don't need to go down the negative divisive path
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I’d always like more.  What I want though is the best people to continue to take on the task that we have set ourselves
INTERVIEWER:  Yes, and you can see we've shown you Joy is falling apart, and I promise I won't spend that $600 grand on my shoes
SHORTEN:  Well, I think that there's been a lot of developments, hasn't there? This is not just Labor saying there's a cloud over the eligibility of a senior minister - it's now Malcolm Turnbull, it's now Julie Bishop
PRIME MINISTER:  An elite group of American operatives, aided by a top-secret tactical command team, must transport an asset who holds life-threatening information to an extraction point 22 miles away through the hostile streets of an Asian city
INTERVIEWER:  You will, it’s possible?
SHORTEN:  Well I've explained that I didn't understand the question that was being asked
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no it’s a long way north. 
INTERVIEWER:  Ohh, what about his statement? Yes, alright.  One Nation, I saw ad nauseam on The Project last night, you're not going to commit to putting them below Labor in the preferences, at this stage anyway
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I'm not easy to intimidate, Leigh. 
SHORTEN:  Well, I just hope that the treating medical advice gets taken seriously
INTERVIEWER:  Well, let's look at One Nation the Party then.  Do One Nation policies represent Australian values or are they at odds with Australian values? 
SHORTEN:  Corporate downsizing expert Ryan Bingham spends his life in planes, airports, and hotels, but just as he’s about to reach a milestone of ten million frequent flyer miles, he meets a woman who causes him to rethink his transient life
PRIME MINISTER:  $200 billion.  Or as you said the other day, $20 thousand million
INTERVIEWER:  No. 
SHORTEN:  Cal Weaver is living the American dream.  He has a good job, a beautiful house, great children and a beautiful wife, named Emily
PRIME MINISTER:  The Labor Party?
INTERVIEWER:  Spell vacuum?
SHORTEN:  Well, sorry, no, it’s actually been shown that over time when you pay for less petrol, it actually costs less
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, Labor makes all sorts of promises when it comes to the economy but their record speaks for itself
INTERVIEWER:  It looks like the Treasurer, Mr Frydenberg will go to a Budget in April, election in May, many of them see this as their last roll of the dice - to deliver a surplus and say look we're the economic guardians
SHORTEN:  The hyperactive red-headed bird enters a turf war with a big city lawyer wanting to tear down his home in an effort to build a house to flip
PRIME MINISTER:  Well there’s two things.  And look, the overall estimate there is an estimate so whether it’s that much… I mean already we’ve put $110 million out since the floods both in Townsville and across North Queensland…
INTERVIEWER:  One giant leap into the unknown. 
PRIME MINISTER:  A bright young yeti finds something he thought didn't exist—a human
SHORTEN:  The war against the Bugs continues! A Federation Starship crash-lands on the distant Alien planet OM-1, stranding beloved leader Sky Marshal Anoke and several others, including comely but tough pilot Lola Beck
INTERVIEWER:  So, I mean, I spoke at a Budget breakfast this morning and I mentioned I'd seen a picture of Malcolm and Tammy Fraser in 1978 getting on board a Japanese bullet train and saying, “This is what we need for Australia
PRIME MINISTER: Waleed please let me answer one question. 
SHORTEN:  Oh, we don't know that yet.  We're working very hard on it
INTERVIEWER:  What do you see when you look at me?
PRIME MINISTER:  A brutal mugging leaves Grey Trace paralyzed in the hospital and his beloved wife dead
SHORTEN:  If you're asking me to specify what a particular company in a particular factory will have to do, I can't do that, nor could you, nor can the Government
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.  Will you instruct your organisation to put them somewhere?
SHORTEN: I'm not going to give the Government a blank cheque
PRIME MINISTER:  $6. 50 for a concession card holder
INTERVIEWER:  If you put in price controls how can their wages go up?
PRIME MINISTER:  In 1926, Newt Scamander arrives at the Magical Congress of the United States of America with a magically expanded briefcase, which houses a number of dangerous creatures and their habitats
SHORTEN:  Well, maybe - but he hasn't moved to embassy either, so - 
INTERVIEWER:  OK so the very fast train to Geelong and back, that's a reality? Or will soon be a reality?
SHORTEN:  In terms of national security?
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s right. 
INTERVIEWER:  You burnt some time there, that’s what I’m sort of saying but that’s alright
PRIME MINISTER:  No, because we're not going to put on 45 per cent reckless emissions target, which is going to put a further tax on the economy
SHORTEN:  Oh Hamish, I think there is a little bit of excitement in your heart, you just need to find it
INTERVIEWER:  Well, they’re announcing today a $640 million fund over four years for what they call ‘bank fairness’
SHORTEN:  Yeah well, there is a way to go, things close up.  But what I'm going to do is focus on the people
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh there’s no doubt.  It is exactly as you said with the fishing boat captain from Indonesia
INTERVIEWER:  When are you going to call the election?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, you were on the other night and as we discussed today, you implied that Muslims couldn’t feel safe because they had a Prime Minister who somehow had been prejudiced against them
SHORTEN:  But we don't take this election for granted at all
INTERVIEWER:  Let me ask you this way -
PRIME MINISTER:  And the Liberal Party has changed their rules to ensure that successful at this election, then if you vote Liberal at this election, you get me as Prime Minister
SHORTEN:  Cheers, see you mate. 
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, just about out of time.  Finally, Prime Minister, we're clearly about to go into election campaign mode
SHORTEN:  Occasionally we do. 
PRIME MINISTER:  As I said it’s done in private. 
INTERVIEWER:  Based on the untold true story. 
PRIME MINISTER:  This is so important to rural and regional communities
SHORTEN:  I don’t think any of us that extreme weather events are getting less frequent, are they?
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Finally and really quickly, the Prime Minister is trying to get together with Muslim leaders to try and sort through some of the angst and the division that is out there
SHORTEN:  Spans the period from 1958 to the present day and tells the story of an unconditional love between a mother and her daughter which is endangered by an unsteady and manipulative father
PRIME MINISTER:  No, it just means what I just said. 
INTERVIEWER: If I can just jump in on that, from the Victorian election there was a lot of criticism and blow back from previous Liberal voters who did not vote for the Coalition in Victoria because of a lack of climate change policy
PRIME MINISTER:  I certainly do. 
SHORTEN:  When this government, when the current Prime Minister was the loyal Treasurer, of the previous Prime Minister - if you believe that I've got a bridge to sell you - but anyway, when the Prime Minister was the Treasurer, when the current Treasurer was the former Environment Minister and when Malcolm Turnbull was still on top, they said the National Energy Guarantee would deliver $550 in lower household prices on energy
INTERVIEWER:  Of the million jobs you’ve created how many have been filled by migrants?
PRIME MINISTER:  No, we will do what is necessary.  There are three tools particularly when it comes to the livestock industry
SHORTEN:  Set between Episode II and III the Clone Wars is the first computer animated Star Wars film
INTERVIEWER:  We talk about the wonderful things that we do. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah and we won't do any deals with One Nation -
SHORTEN:  Well, the Solicitor General's advice that they had, that broadly said that the better view that the Solicitor-General thought was that Mr Joyce was eligible, but they didn't give that categorical assurance and that's the same here
INTERVIEWER:  So why single out the Lebanese community in that context?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well look, the suspension is a matter that the Senators will consider
SHORTEN:  First of all, there's what happens before an election
INTERVIEWER:  OK.  But households at the moment are nervous
PRIME MINISTER: But there's no doubt that so many forms of hatred and stereotyping goes on in the Australian community
SHORTEN:  love. 
INTERVIEWER:  Do you have a problem if Julie Bishop is nominated and installed as the next Governor-General even before the term of the current one expires? 
PRIME MINISTER:  That this is an important plan that we've been working on from the day that I became Prime Minister
SHORTEN:  Sure. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  The system failed.  She won't
SHORTEN:  Listen, I don't want to get into a debate about the facts, but your last statement is 100 per cent wrong
PRIME MINISTER:  He was the one, I wore a cap of his and people sledged me for the hat
INTERVIEWER:  The security agencies had to say “Hang on, that’s not what we said”
PRIME MINISTER:  They exist and they are there –
SHORTEN:  We will do that closer to the election but suffice to say we have done our maths and we are able to pay for the promises we are making
INTERVIEWER:  So the costs are the same?
PRIME MINISTER:  No, because that was not what it is about.  It was about … I mean people know many things about me but one thing I am sure they know is that when it comes to border protection I don't waiver, ever and that is why I took the strong position I did on this
SHORTEN:  You can't sugar-coat this.  This is an Australian citizen who has been detained in China, the Embassy has just been notified
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  None of this –
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, we were at Sporties last night with Johnsy who cleaned me up on the pool table, he’s a bit of a local legend there as I understand
SHORTEN:  It's so dishonest this debate.  It is so dishonest - 
INTERVIEWER:  We're just go to a package and we will come back to you
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it won't make a difference whether it’s introduced this week or not
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, I haven't commented on the polls for the last five years
INTERVIEWER:  And a Coke?
PRIME MINISTER:  Jon, we’re getting it done. 
SHORTEN:  Well there's two issues there.  One is the person and the other is the office
INTERVIEWER:  Don’t forget death duties, don’t forget death duties
SHORTEN:  I like the principle, that's my answer.  I think the principle of it
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m doing great Fairsy and thanks for having us in here today
INTERVIEWER:  He’s an elephant. 
SHORTEN:  I think it would, be if they rush this, this will be an act of desperation, and what they want to do is try and assert decisions for which they don't have any responsibility after the next election if they are unsuccessful
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, two things, a) Cabinet have not considered this matter, Cabinet will soon consider this matter
INTERVIEWER:  Alright.  Just before we let you go, Australia has woken up to five different time zones this morning
SHORTEN:  Thank you Jon. 
PRIME MINISTER:  It's a city in its own right. 
INTERVIEWER:  You don’t care?
SHORTEN:  You've got to tell people where they fit in.  Change is not too hard but you do have to make sure that you don't leave people behind
PRIME MINISTER:  Framed in the 1940s for the double murder of his wife and her lover, upstanding banker Andy Dufresne begins a new life at the Shawshank prison, where he puts his accounting skills to work for an amoral warden
INTERVIEWER:  So you will do anything you can to get the best laws in place to advance those policies but you rejected the advice of the security agencies on the medevac laws last week …
PRIME MINISTER:  We’re proceeding cautiously here.  Warren and I had a good discussion about this, as well as with some locals
SHORTEN:  No, no.  Let's -
INTERVIEWER:  But Suse never gets beaten on time and if it’s a draw the person with the quickest time wins
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah Jeff’s always good for some advice. 
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I've got to say that I think we should have an Australian head of state but my family, my eight year old is driving me crazy to meet Meghan Markle - there's no question that the royals - that every little girl loves a princess
INTERVIEWER:  So what does this poor coot do when he uses a utility? Either he reduces his earnings and cops it, or alternately he puts someone off, or he jacks up the price of his product
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, just on this issue of grandfathering, you are quite right, when it comes to negative gearing all of the people currently negatively geared will not be affected and you’ll still be able to negatively gear your houses…
PRIME MINISTER:  I will continue to work with the Victorian government
INTERVIEWER:  I remember the interviews with some of the people and they were just saying; ‘They kept lying to us and lying to us and lying to us about where we were going, what we were doing, what would happen when we were on the boat
PRIME MINISTER:  No there hasn’t. 
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, you know that when the polls are good or bad, over five years, one month and 13 days, I haven't commented
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  He’s proposing tax relief for most Australians whilst at the same time going to get rid of what he says is a rort…
PRIME MINISTER:  No but they won't be Alan.  That's the thing, the banks are already –
SHORTEN:  6-year-old Susan Walker has doubts about childhood's most enduring miracle—Santa Claus
INTERVIEWER:  Well yeah, absolutely, drop on by. 
SHORTEN:  We will only ever give you facts - important facts
PRIME MINISTER:  Medical professionals. 
INTERVIEWER:  Have you met Peter Scott up there?
SHORTEN:  Only one leader in this country has done a deal with Clive Palmer
PRIME MINISTER:  I think you should go to the footy every opportunity you get
INTERVIEWER:  Christchurch. 
SHORTEN:  What our changes will mean is that it will be fairer, in terms of…
PRIME MINISTER:  And what we have achieved are $10 billion and better improvements on the Budget bottom line in the last two Budgets we delivered, Fran
INTERVIEWER:  You can't just pluck a number out of nowhere.  You've come up with the 45 per cent target
PRIME MINISTER:  France, June 1944.  On the eve of D-Day, some American paratroopers fall behind enemy lines after their aircraft crashes while on a mission to destroy a radio tower in a small village near the beaches of Normandy
SHORTEN:  After his wife dies, a blacksmith named Balian is thrust into royalty, political intrigue and bloody holy wars during the Crusades
INTERVIEWER:  And congestion is directly tied to immigration which was one of the drivers for the Liberal Party's unrest last week
PRIME MINISTER:  Good on you Ben.  And good luck to Ash Barty tomorrow, I was down there yesterday with Jen and the girls and we got to meet her
SHORTEN:  Well I don't know the answer to that, but I'm not sure that Mr Morrison does
INTERVIEWER:  Face your fate. 
PRIME MINISTER:  And it is worse than that.  Let me take you through it
SHORTEN:  Set on an island off the coast of New England in the summer of 1965, Moonrise Kingdom tells the story of two twelve-year-olds who fall in love, make a secret pact, and run away together into the wilderness
INTERVIEWER:  Delve into the darkness. 
SHORTEN:  Well, that's all happened under the current government and that's at the heart of this election
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Ben, happy new year to you and all your listeners
INTERVIEWER:  Change the way you see. 
SHORTEN:  A getaway driver for a bank robbery realizes he has been double crossed and races to find out who betrayed him
PRIME MINISTER:  I have always acted consistently with that in shadow cabinet, in the Cabinet, by my policy decisions as Minister and in my own personal conduct
INTERVIEWER:  Well just on that… just on that and you know there’s hundreds doctors who argue with you on that but your Minister Peter Dutton this week has warned that Australians will be kicked off waiting lists for hospitals and public housing by an influx of transferees under that legislation
SHORTEN:  Lovely thank you very much for your interest. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh a big smiley face, mate.  A big smiley face
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  There hasn’t been? In real terms?
SHORTEN:  We're going to change the laws and we're going to put the resources to enforce the laws
PRIME MINISTER:  Well what we're seeing is that people know that we're still the Government and that they know I’ll turn boats back
INTERVIEWER:  Redefine the hussle. 
SHORTEN:  I don't know if he is back from Bali yet, with the old mop, cleaning up Mr Morrison's problems
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it was the Labor Party who pulled this out of their…
INTERVIEWER:  Yep.  All right Bill Shorten, thanks for joining us
SHORTEN:  There couldn't have been anyone who was committing me to a preference deal
PRIME MINISTER:  The Australian investigations picked up immediately and we've been assisting not only directly with the inquiries in New Zealand but also providing assistance and coordinating that investigation linking up with other countries around the world
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, so in the Leichhardt fight, Warren Entsch is going up against a female candidate
PRIME MINISTER:  Well no, we have actually got a lot more than that, that has come from support from businesses and individuals all across the country who understand what $200 billion of higher taxes will mean for the economy
SHORTEN:  cement, steel, aluminium and other sectors.  We have created a $300 million dollar fund to help them invest in new technology
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister thank you very much for joining us
PRIME MINISTER:  Taking place after alien crafts land around the world, an expert linguist is recruited by the military to determine whether they come in peace or are a threat
SHORTEN:  Author P. L
INTERVIEWER:  The greatest fairy tale never told. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, that wasn't just what Josh said last night, that's certainly where he started because getting the Budget back into balance means Australia is paying its way
SHORTEN:  I think there's a lot more water to go under the bridge but the real issue here in terms of Australians and why it matters to the everyday voter, is that you have the Minister for Home Affairs, a very important person, making very important decisions, there shouldn't be any Constitutional cloud over his eligibility to make those decisions, and I think that the Government needs to just clear the issue up
INTERVIEWER:  And just finally on this programme recently Mr Shorten committed to doing two prime time interviews with 7
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks Alan. 
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, the reason why we're doing it is there is no principle that says it is fair that a non-taxpayer gets a tax refund, a cash tax refund
INTERVIEWER: Haven’t they have done for a long time?
SHORTEN:  
PRIME MINISTER:  Five years after meeting her three fathers, Sophie Sheridan prepares to open her mother’s hotel
INTERVIEWER:  But it’s not free that’s the point. 
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s the big thing I think in Brisbane say over the last ten/15 years I mean, you know, I grew up in Sydney and it’s always been congested and we’ve got to do a lot there too and Melbourne is the same but Brisbane has been growing really rapidly and that’s been great because people’s businesses have been growing and they’ve been doing well and there’s lots of jobs and that’s all fantastic but you’ve got to keep the congestion busting happening
SHORTEN:  Following a wild night out with his Best Man, Rob Anderson wakes up to find himself naked in an elevator on the morning of his wedding day and is forced to relive the morning over and over again
INTERVIEWER:  Will you preference them?
SHORTEN:  No.  Let's go to one
PRIME MINISTER:  Well hang on, we’ve just got a process Neil.  We'll make that decision in accordance with our normal process, not because the Labor Party wants to go around, you know, trying to force us into making decisions
INTERVIEWER:  Thank you, I understand you were ill.  Thank you for your time
SHORTEN:  Yes, I thought the vote would be successful but what I realised on the morning of the vote being declared was the amount of pressure that a lot of people - LGBTQ people felt because what it was is this silly process which got the right outcome
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, what I’m saying is, whatever people have been saying, we’ve just been getting on with the job
INTERVIEWER:  I am asking you a question about whether or not describing people, Prime Minister –
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I believe that how we respond to this - which is, frankly, in sorrow, in disappointment - is the appropriate response, and to appeal to the goodwill of the relationship that has existed for a very long time and to see that put back on its appropriate footings
SHORTEN:  Steve Ford is a private detective in Venice Beach, Calif
INTERVIEWER:  Name the comedian who withdrew from hosting the 2019 Oscars? Dunno?
SHORTEN:  Well under Scott Morrison, immigration has gone up, not down
PRIME MINISTER:  And I’ll be exercising that at that time. 
INTERVIEWER:  No, not every one that is sought. 
SHORTEN:  A former Secret Service agent grudgingly takes an assignment to protect a pop idol who's threatened by a crazed fan
PRIME MINISTER:  Correct, yes. 
INTERVIEWER:  If you've got nothing else on, you’re always welcome
PRIME MINISTER:  Look all I've been doing Neil is [inaudible], showing Australians what our record is on national security, on the economy and that's what guarantees essential services
SHORTEN:  No.  What we will do though is we're going to pick up what Malcolm Turnbull proposed
INTERVIEWER:  So power bills will be cheaper, will be less under Labor?
PRIME MINISTER:  Katniss Everdeen reluctantly becomes the symbol of a mass rebellion against the autocratic Capitol
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, it's publicly available, now if we're saying, the campaign against climate change by this government is malicious and stupid
INTERVIEWER:  On the Asians?
PRIME MINISTER:  In the heat of the moment when people are upset –
SHORTEN:  Well, it is certainly easier said than done, but we have got to do it
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  One of the issues here obviously is that when people get a medical transfer to Australia then a lot of them then launch legal actions to stay
SHORTEN:  Well the Government sets great store on these matters
PRIME MINISTER:  It is our job to take the temperature down, that's what tolerant societies do
INTERVIEWER:  I'm really torn on this and I feel so sorry for these children
SHORTEN:  Well, I think that part of the reason why Clive Palmer is copping some criticism is that he used to run a nickel plant or business interest associated with it in Townsville
PRIME MINISTER:  Thank you. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  To save the future, they must alter the past. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Good morning. 
SHORTEN:  A deadly airborne virus finds its way into the USA and starts killing off people at an epidemic rate
INTERVIEWER:  That bill can be improved.  That bill can be improved with a simple addition
SHORTEN:  Yeah –
PRIME MINISTER:  When ten-year-old Lewis is suddenly orphaned, he is sent to live with his Uncle Jonathan in a creaky (and creepy) old mansion with a mysterious ticking noise that emanates from the walls
INTERVIEWER:  Is it a moral fail to build an election surplus off starving the National Disability Insurance Scheme of money, leaving disabled people without the services they need?
PRIME MINISTER:  I talk about how they’re going to hit retirees with a $5 billion a year tax
SHORTEN:  Good morning Michael. 
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Morrison I understand that [inaudible] the same [inaudible] so are you going to be funding that?
PRIME MINISTER:  Colorado Springs, late 1970s.  Ron Stallworth, an African American police officer, and Flip Zimmerman, his Jewish colleague, run an undercover operation to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan
SHORTEN:  The rebellious Thracian Spartacus, born and raised a slave, is sold to Gladiator trainer Batiatus
INTERVIEWER:  That was recommended to you by Home Affairs. 
PRIME MINISTER: The Government has been putting a $1 billion extra into aged care every single year, $1 billion extra
SHORTEN:  Sorry, I didn't pluck that out of nowhere.  That was the Paris Agreement
INTERVIEWER:  So, will you try and push this?
PRIME MINISTER:  It's not for me to have a view about that, it's for her to have a view about what she does
SHORTEN:  The dynamic duo of Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon return for another crazy adventure
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah I remember. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Good morning Alan. 
SHORTEN:  Frank Drebin is persuaded out of retirement to go undercover in a state prison
INTERVIEWER:  Well when the politicians are talking to the average person we then feel part of the process, we then can move along with you, we understand what laws are changing, why we're moving in that direction, if we're just thrown stupid law at us we're going to fight them back
PRIME MINISTER:  Well –
SHORTEN:  Set in the ghettos of Paris in 2010, an undercover cop and ex-thug try to infiltrate a gang in order to defuse a neutron bomb
INTERVIEWER:  It certainly is a lovely spot. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No it doesn’t.  I think it’s disappointing
SHORTEN:  Listen I'm not going to get - sorry, there's only one person who has ever been resurrected and I'm not going to compare Clive Palmer to him
INTERVIEWER:  Let me ask you a question that I also asked Treasurer Frydenberg last night; isn't it a sign of policy failure of this government, that you're giving people a one-off payment to help with expenses, rather than at this point in the life of your government being able to say; "Look, we've put in place policies during the past six years that have consistently driven down your medical bills, consistently driven down your insurance premiums and consistently driven down your power bills?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well the fiscal impacts of this plan are no impact, it has no impact on the Budget and that's what we've been working through and that's why it is, I think, a very responsible level of intake
SHORTEN:  Yes ours is a nine day tour, although because it overlapped with the weekend, I've had a day on the Sunshine Coast
INTERVIEWER:  Every con has its pros. 
SHORTEN:  Being one of 101 takes its toll on Patch, who doesn't feel unique
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m saying the report is not true.  Ok? So we acted in accordance with our security advice, and that was, that bill should not be accepted
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Now, of electric cars.  Have you got one?
SHORTEN:  Well, this is the other good news - what it's going to mean is if you can store the energy during the day - say the family watching the show this morning, the kids go off to school, mum and dad might go to work - what happens is at the moment, if you have just got solar panels, you don't get the energy when you need it which is in the evenings, when the kids turn computers on and you need the energy
PRIME MINISTER:  And we will, Deb.  Deb, I always knew we were going to put these policies in place and I was very clear about that all the way through and these are the policies that will continue to get us there in 2030
INTERVIEWER:  Onto your announcement today, this intention has been flagged for a long time
PRIME MINISTER:  Not a problem. 
SHORTEN:  Yes, she and Penny and myself, we think that the time has come to revisit that
INTERVIEWER:  I want to talk about your tax plan. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it is.  He hasn’t got the ticker for it when it comes to this stuff
SHORTEN:  We’re here to explain Labor’s great policies for this election
INTERVIEWER:  Don't set him off. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Waleed, that is not true.  What is suggested is that I said that we should exploit, exploit concerns about Islam in the community to our political advantage
SHORTEN:  Well, there are positives in this agreement too, for our farmers, for our steel industry, for our higher education sector
INTERVIEWER:  Vote Compass is the online tool that ABC is using during the election campaign to gauge Australians’ views on the policies, taking the personalities out of it
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all let's look at where the house prices have fallen
PRIME MINISTER:  They’re welcome to make their commentary, like anyone is
INTERVIEWER:  Because I guess that would make people why we need to spend another $2 billion to get there, because you have said in the past as you have said now we will meet those Paris targets by 2030, and you used the language in a canter, so why do we need to do this spending?
SHORTEN:  If he kills the king, Draco will die as well. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Because Fran I'm going to put this Budget to the Australian people
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  That’s it. 
SHORTEN:  Sarah, you know, it’s about time we buried the sausage scandal of 2016
PRIME MINISTER:  No, he's been supporting particularly Dave Sharma in Wentworth
INTERVIEWER:  If the approval ratings keep going the way they are, you're not going to start looking over your shoulder are you? Albo is ravenous
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s right, this infrastructure plan is all about two things
SHORTEN:  I will get Brendan to supplement the answer.  We are not going to pick a final number but I will state this
INTERVIEWER:  Well, there were some members who went on the record, some of whom weren't at the meeting
PRIME MINISTER:  Well there’s been plenty of shouting and hot air, Jon, but what I’m saying is…
SHORTEN:  The adventures of a heroic and debonair stalwart mouse named Stuart Little with human qualities, who faces some comic misadventures while searching for his lost bird friend and living with a human family as their child
INTERVIEWER:  What half of it was not true? That was the advice from the security agency
PRIME MINISTER:  I think it's serious and I think it always has been and that's why at the federal level our agencies have always taken it seriously
SHORTEN:  A wife questions her life choices as she travels to Stockholm with her husband, where he is slated to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature
INTERVIEWER:  And now Josh Wilson supports a two-state solution in Israel and that is also causing you some tension? 
PRIME MINISTER:  They all are.  Look, the way I'm looking at it, there's three stages to this
SHORTEN:  Because I've never forgotten the men I met there and their families, never forgotten them
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, no doubt about that.  This is dangerous stuff now
SHORTEN:  No, that doesn't mean that people never talk to me but listen I think that what we've got to do is - the media plays an important role, people are entitled to their opinions
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no there’s tax relief going right across the board
INTERVIEWER:  No Hammer.  No Problem
SHORTEN:  But it's interesting, when you get off a plane at Tullamarine or at Mascot when you come from overseas, whilst you've enjoyed your visit overseas you know there's things about this country we're proud of, but we don't - when we get back to Australia - when we're overseas do we talk about our Medicare system or our tax deductions?
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no I don’t believe so, I don’t believe so.  But I’ll speak for myself -
INTERVIEWER:  70 per cent, right. 
SHORTEN:  I think Wentworth is a hard seat for Labor to win
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, the basis of who is elected at the next election, that's going to be done by the Australian people
INTERVIEWER:  I see, so you made the change so it would be passed through Parliament?
PRIME MINISTER:  Good on you mate, cheers. 
SHORTEN:  The adventures of two California Highway Patrol motorcycle officers as they make their rounds on the freeways of Los Angeles
INTERVIEWER:  And Albury Wodonga, you want to have a look at a business case?
SHORTEN:  Grace, a compassionate young supervisor at a foster care facility, works with her boyfriend and colleague, Mason, to help at-risk teens
PRIME MINISTER:  Jon, if we're in a position to start earlier, we will
INTERVIEWER:  Right thanks mate. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Absolutely, as they should. 
SHORTEN:  They still are.  They still are
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  And we hand over the official sticker which I’m sure you’ll appreciate
PRIME MINISTER:  That was a very specific issue for them. 
SHORTEN:  Well you would love to know what business Tim is in, he obviously is having some business difficulties already, but let me just say this on climate change
INTERVIEWER:  Well this climate solutions fund as you are calling it this morning, will it be used to underwrite new coal projects of which the government, your Government with Angus Taylor has identified ten?
PRIME MINISTER:  Twenty-two years after the events of Jurassic Park, Isla Nublar now features a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, Jurassic World, as originally envisioned by John Hammond
SHORTEN:  Seven strangers are taken out of their daily lives and placed mysteriously in a deadly cube where they all agree they must find their way out
INTERVIEWER:  These are really good questions.  Why don't you ask the Prime Minister himself on Nine News
PRIME MINISTER:  Only to say that all options are open. 
SHORTEN:  No, I'm not obsessed by the polls.  I've never thought that the election was a foregone conclusion
INTERVIEWER:  Labor has announced details of it's long awaited energy policy
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I mean I think that is absolutely a perception that is there and as I said at the Press Club a few weeks ago obviously these things play into this issue you know the extent of that currently I think that is a matter that is often debated but let’s understand where we are right now we are meeting and exceeding our carbon emission reduction targets that we set for ourselves right now
SHORTEN:  Well that's going to be a matter for the state and federal regulators isn't it
INTERVIEWER:  But if they have done that, it certainly reinforces the strength and undermines your argument that it's weakened, doesn’t it? If they have done that?
PRIME MINISTER:  I said we will make those decisions at the time of nominations closing, Stephen, and that’s when we’re going to do that
SHORTEN:  We get into the adjectives game, what I can say is it is too low
INTERVIEWER:  A new recovery agency will be set up to develop a long-term plan to rebuild the shattered industry, and beef producers will be offered cheaper loans, under a $2 billion plan to subsidise their debt
PRIME MINISTER:  I have. 
SHORTEN:  Well he couldn't even bring it to the Parliament. 
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison welcome to the Project
PRIME MINISTER:  Sure
SHORTEN:  Any questions about this or other matters?
INTERVIEWER:  Bill, come on! We know our own Simon Reeve is beside himself about daylight savings, living in Queensland -
PRIME MINISTER:  And you’ve got it wrong, Jon. 
SHORTEN:  Well, I don't accept your assumption it's less enticing
INTERVIEWER:  That’s not it's not my question. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, because what this is about is entering Australians that keep more of what they earn
SHORTEN:  Do we spend too much or we won't spend enough? The reality is for me, it's not - I don't view education and health -
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  And if anyone is trying to convince you to change your mind, forget about it, it’s game on
SHORTEN:  I'm not choosing it, the scientists say it.  It's what we've got to do to stop the planet getting warmer
PRIME MINISTER:  This is something all of us I think –
INTERVIEWER:  The Prime Minister joins me now from Canberra, Prime Minister thank you very much for being with us
PRIME MINISTER:  Despite his family’s baffling generations-old ban on music, Miguel dreams of becoming an accomplished musician like his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz
SHORTEN: I do think that there's too much bullying goes on and by that, I don't necessarily know what has happened to her and I don't have the facts but I have seen some of the Government rush to say oh it's all made up or that's just life
INTERVIEWER:  …investing in new, coal-fired power station this side of an election? Do we think anyone is going to get into the market?
PRIME MINISTER:  I was concerned that we needed to address them, which is what I've been doing inside and outside of the Parliament for the last 10 years of my life
SHORTEN:  Yeah, and I said I'd come to that issue.  I said there are two issues
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Before we doing anything seriously, you went to Hemingway’s
PRIME MINISTER:  First of all I want to assure all Australians that I have already conveyed directly, at the highest level, our strong views on this topic and the fact that Abu Bakar Bashir was convicted of crimes under the Indonesian justice system
SHORTEN:  The Liberals are lying about tax.  I don't want to talk too much about it
INTERVIEWER:  We are going to see a bit more of you in Victoria in the next few months…
SHORTEN:  Well we've had plenty of administrative heads of the Labor Party who haven't ended up in Parliament
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we have our candidates set as we go in and we’ve got a strong female representation and there are more seats to fill between now and the next election
INTERVIEWER:  Yule crack up. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Because I'm part of a Party that has a process and that Party listens to a lot of people in it's organisation who are members of our Party
SHORTEN:  A group of students become trapped inside a mysterious cave where they discover time passes differently underground than on the surface
INTERVIEWER:  Are you embarrassed by it? 
SHORTEN:  See you guys.  Thank you
PRIME MINISTER:  No Waleed, you have said that Andrew Robb said something that he did not
INTERVIEWER:  You mentioned that national anti-corruption watchdog, saying you will work with the Coalition but not wait for them
SHORTEN:  When CIA Analyst Jack Ryan interferes with an IRA assassination, a renegade faction targets Jack and his family as revenge
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanos.  A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality
INTERVIEWER:  Now, what he’s saying is right … because if you charge an electric car for eight minutes, it will get you from Cronulla to Caringbah
SHORTEN:  I think the state election had a range of state issues, there is always a lesson there and we're not complacent
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we’re in a process there but as I said on the road the other day, it’s not my job to get upset, it’s my job to get him home
INTERVIEWER:  But it is April now. 
SHORTEN:  Good morning. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes. 
INTERVIEWER:  Now, you’re pledging to spend a lot of money through this campaign
PRIME MINISTER: One in four Australians struggle with mental health issues and for our young people, we’ve got to take this on
SHORTEN:  Look forward to talking. 
INTERVIEWER:  No luck, you have a message. 
SHORTEN:  Six short stories that explore the extremities of human behavior involving people in distress
PRIME MINISTER:  Well you couldn’t build one of this side of the election
INTERVIEWER:  It's not a lie. 
SHORTEN:  Oh no.  Listen, you and I know that, and more importantly Australians know, this is a Government who is going to run on fear and negativity
PRIME MINISTER:  I'm always interested in how we can help people with cancer
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  I understand.  Do you understand –
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh.  I am, you certainly will
SHORTEN:  When the evil wizard Gargamel chases the tiny blue Smurfs out of their village, they tumble from their magical world and into ours -- in fact, smack dab in the middle of Central Park
INTERVIEWER:  You don’t?
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah well and truly, I’ve been back into it for quite a while now and we’re up here in Cairns
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, we think that the Commonwealth and the politicians should have an anti-corruption commission
INTERVIEWER:  That is a huge help.  Mr Shorten on that last point is it paid to parents or to child care centres? How does it work?
SHORTEN:  there is still a man inside the machine. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Captain Jack Sparrow works his way out of a blood debt with the ghostly Davey Jones, he also attempts to avoid eternal damnation
INTERVIEWER:  Name the comedian who withdrew from hosting the 2019 Oscars?
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes.  Three things
SHORTEN:  Well, the fact of the matter is we are arguing for a change in Australia
INTERVIEWER:  Are you aware of the stickers? There’s that one if you win
SHORTEN:  I'll certainly be watching Four Corners and I thought one of your panellist's comments that maybe the Government was anticipating a pretty tough story, I'll be watching that
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no, we always knew that there would be more that needed to be done and I have said that on several occasions and I said we’d be announcing that before the election
INTERVIEWER:  I can understand that there's probably some pretty significant deterrent effect there by saying you're not coming to the mainland, you’re going to Christmas Island but I'm just wondering, because the advice was that saying that the applications were ready to go
PRIME MINISTER:  Look what I said last Monday when I was here in Melbourne is, I don't think it helps that we constantly go back to just herding people into tribes and seeking to create further conflict around this stuff
SHORTEN:  No, he supports party policy and that is our party policy, a two-state solution - the right of Israel to exist behind secure borders but also recognising the legitimate aspirations of Palestinian people to their own country
INTERVIEWER:  But if you are choosing that yes we will go with that number, with 45 per cent, you must have done
SHORTEN:  they want to look after the top end of town by cutting services to everyone
PRIME MINISTER:  No, and I said that.  There's no evidence to suggest that at this point
INTERVIEWER:  On energy in north and central Queensland, is that limited to underwriting or could subsidies be a part of that program?
SHORTEN:  A young man goes to his father's home in Maine where, helped by a public registry, he locates and tracks down sex offenders
PRIME MINISTER:  Just on North Queensland, let me be clear, I'm still going to make sure that’s happening
INTERVIEWER:  Just a quick one on Townsville, I know you have been there
PRIME MINISTER:  I don't know if Australians understand Islam very well and that can often lead to fear of things you don't understand
SHORTEN:  Let's go through each of those points rather than rapid fire, let's have a conversation
INTERVIEWER:  Now this is a matter of some celebration up here I would imagine, this is from today’s Courier Mail the rate heart disease and premature death in North Queensland will be targeted under a $12 million Federal Government plan to send cardiology clinics to the bush
SHORTEN:  It mightn't be enough, I get that so - 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it’s pretty simple.  A 45 per cent emissions reduction target wipes out Australian industries
INTERVIEWER:  Appreciate it.  Just a couple of questions, I was planning to go to the footy on the 11th of May, the 18th of May or the 25th of May
PRIME MINISTER:  Stillman, a heartbroken physics student, builds a time machine when his girlfriend breaks up with him
SHORTEN:  That will be up to the Australian people, Georgie but if I am, I won't let you or the Australian people down
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Ok
SHORTEN:  I think there are some things that we can do -
PRIME MINISTER:  Look to be fair, particularly when you're talking about younger children, I mean, kids are kids I think
INTERVIEWER:  What's the problem with that?
SHORTEN:  They are not correct.  There you go, short answer too
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's why you wouldn't go and put $200 billion of extra taxes on the economy
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, thank you very much for joining us. 
PRIME MINISTER:  OK let’s see how we go. 
SHORTEN:  A young violinist unravels her long lost father's past, triggering dark forces that reach beyond her imagination
INTERVIEWER:  Just wanted to confirm that.  The CFMEU is asking all Queenslanders to sign a pledge to support the coal industry
PRIME MINISTER:  Framed and on the run, a former FBI agent must save his family from a blazing fire in the world's tallest building
SHORTEN:  On the run in the year 1987, Bumblebee finds refuge in a junkyard in a small Californian beach town
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister Scott Morrison thanks for your time
SHORTEN:  Well I don't hold the children responsible for the mistakes of their parents
PRIME MINISTER:  Well two points on that, we’ve been taking action on that very point to ensure that these companies do pay their superannuation
INTERVIEWER:  There’s a mob called ‘Aussie Farms’ you may have seen these guys
PRIME MINISTER:  No, the business case needs to be done which works out the most effective way to do this, that's the first stage of the plan
SHORTEN:  Well good point.  We are keeping an eye on this
INTERVIEWER:  Based on  a true story.  We’re not kidding
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s basically… it’s a form of guarantee and which will reduce the costs to farms which means all of that cost of funds, will be passed on to each of the farmers in their restructuring of their existing debts and that is the same for the restocking loans as well
SHORTEN:  A tormented jazz musician finds himself lost in an enigmatic story involving murder, surveillance, gangsters, doppelgangers, and an impossible transformation inside a prison cell
INTERVIEWER:  And why have they rejected them?
PRIME MINISTER:  Not very often but I thought it was very appropriate, because under… this is what Labor's emissions reduction policy is - half of their carbon emissions reductions is actually forcing businesses to buy carbon credits from other places outside Australia
SHORTEN:  An extraordinarily intelligent young girl from a cruel and uncaring family discovers she possesses telekinetic powers and is sent off to a school headed by a tyrannical principal
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Oh OK, alright. 
SHORTEN:  Well, we have a look around the world and the Americans have been able to make some big breakthroughs in some financial scandals by basically encouraging some of the people involved to be able to come forward and get a reward
PRIME MINISTER:  Well coal creates lots and lots and lots of jobs. 
INTERVIEWER:  This announcement comes three days out from a crucial state election where population growth and congestion are very big issues there and where the incumbent Liberal Party is in trouble
SHORTEN: Great to be on the show. 
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s very kind. 
INTERVIEWER:  Is it right that there’s already been a reaction in parts of the world where people smugglers ply their trade, that there’s already chatter in that part of the world?
PRIME MINISTER:  If someone needs… this is what currently happens.  If someone needs very serious medical attention
SHORTEN:  No, no, hang on, Leigh.  You keep characterising my policies -
INTERVIEWER:  But are those views still entrenched in some parts?
SHORTEN:  We're certainly more progressive than the current government in Canberra
PRIME MINISTER:  No, that’s not true…
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister I'm asking you a question about a report that is sourced from multiple people, that was reported by multiple journalists, by which all of those journalists stand
SHORTEN:  We're not going back to the policies of the past.  We're not going to have a carbon tax
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes. 
INTERVIEWER:  Is the CFMEU bullying your Labor colleagues in Queensland?
PRIME MINISTER:  The Skilling Australians Fund – Michaelia might want to speak to this as well – that is already funding the additional training arrangements for the traditional skills and things like that
SHORTEN:  A newly married couple who, in the process of starting a family, learn many of life's important lessons from their trouble-loving retriever, Marley
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  So will you put One Nation last now in the seat of Cook?
SHORTEN:  No, I’m happy if you do.  What car you choose to drive is your business
PRIME MINISTER:  This is why our plan does address those issues, Michael
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Yep. 
SHORTEN:  The setting is Detroit in 1995.  The city is divided by 8 Mile, a road that splits the town in half along racial lines
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I don't share their views when it comes to how they see a role for big government in this country
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten, regarding, on the-
PRIME MINISTER:  Well not under us, no.  I think our border protection regime, I think people smugglers know that when they come up against me they've got a brick wall
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, we don't accept that.  This is the Government who's raised more taxes than anyone before us
INTERVIEWER:  That's essentially fence sitting though, isn't it?
PRIME MINISTER:  The historical record may say something different
SHORTEN:  There comes a point in everyone’s life when you have to make a decision about the direction you’re going to take
INTERVIEWER:  You didn't, Prime Minister, with respect, you didn’t
PRIME MINISTER:  Well thanks Fran, one last thing before I go.  The other thing we’re announcing in Townsville today, is the small business assistance
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, the Government a few weeks ago said that they wanted to look at how we can break through the encrypted telecommunications of people who are criminals, terrorists and the like
INTERVIEWER:  Do you feel like the Australian people though, have lost confidence in their politicians –
SHORTEN:  It's always possible to get airtime if you're willing to say silly things but if you want to have a strong, sensible, centrist debate and this is what Mr Turnbull perhaps missed the opportunity to do, he came in with a lot of good will, is you have to lead but you can lead from the centre
PRIME MINISTER:  Young princess Anna of Arendelle dreams about finding true love at her sister Elsa’s coronation
INTERVIEWER:  No. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Determined to prove herself, Officer Judy Hopps, the first bunny on Zootopia's police force, jumps at the chance to crack her first case - even if it means partnering with scam-artist fox Nick Wilde to solve the mystery
SHORTEN:  No, I'm just saying that he can make decisions which affect them now, but appointing -  this is the Head of State of Australia
INTERVIEWER:  I'm not accusing you of not having ever worked with the Muslim community in Sydney, or even not having done it for a long time
PRIME MINISTER:  We are taking the advice on how it has to be implemented and we'll be doing that
SHORTEN:  No.  No
INTERVIEWER:  Everyone is a suspect. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I find it a very offensive comment, of course I do
SHORTEN:  Every other level of government has an anti-corruption commission, other states have
INTERVIEWER:  But not all disrespect –
SHORTEN:  Yeah lovely to talk.  And it's going to be great to see some people even though it's marking a tragic event
PRIME MINISTER:  But he didn't take free tickets in the first place
INTERVIEWER:  But you can take his head off, you won’t take hers off
SHORTEN:  The infamous story of Benjamin Barker, a. k
PRIME MINISTER:  I’d really like them to get the gas out from under the ground, Alan, they’ve locked it up here in New South Wales and in Victoria for too long and you know what that’s done to electricity prices? That
INTERVIEWER:  A couple of other questions, were you aware of anyone at all who is acting on Labor's behalf who was talking about preference deals with Clive Palmer? Were you aware of anyone in the Labor Party or in the union movement that was talking on your behalf?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well you're saying that there was no risk Waleed. 
SHORTEN:  As you'd be aware, Labor's been working hard from Opposition to identify how we can improve the bottom line of the Budget
INTERVIEWER:  So would you look at this? If you’re on the minimum wage, you’re paying $70 a week in tax
SHORTEN:  Yes it's good.  It's really good
PRIME MINISTER:  Fuelled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince assemble a team of metahumans consisting of Barry Allen, Arthur Curry and Victor Stone to face the catastrophic threat of Steppenwolf and the Parademons who are on the hunt for three Mother Boxes on Earth

PRIME MINISTER:  This is the biggest tax relief we have seen since the Howard Government
INTERVIEWER:  He wasn't aware and he wasn't paying for the tickets?
SHORTEN:  No.  And let's just be clear on that
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, it's going to be about a half a trillion dollars overall, we believe, as a result of what Bill Shorten wants
INTERVIEWER:  Well these are the next generation of the kids clearly matter to you according to that policy yet at the same time you stand here today and you won't promise to get 112 kids out of detention on Nauru despite the appalling mental health conditions their detention has created, despite calls from Australian doctors at the AMA, pediatricians, psychologists, so not all kids are equal hey?
PRIME MINISTER:  The best way for me to address any problem is to lead by my own example and I’ve just said –
SHORTEN:  Well all of the research we've seen and the evidence - between 60 and 90 per cent, I mean you heard that right
INTERVIEWER:  I understand your point but when I ask about Islamophobia, I don’t mean just that people don’t understand and they are a bit apprehensive
PRIME MINISTER:  No, they’re Australia’s credits because we achieved them
SHORTEN:  Perhaps if you bear with me for a moment, I'll answer your question
INTERVIEWER:  So you agree with Alan Tudge, the newly sworn-in Minister, who says let's try and get migrants to go to the regions rather than Sydney and Melbourne
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I was with the Australian Workers Union, I was the Victorian Secretary and I was involved in trying to protect the workforce from the unfair blame of the company and trying to make sense of what had happened
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that’ll be ultimately tested at the election and that’s for them to make those commentaries, not be
INTERVIEWER:  I’m not. 
SHORTEN:  Politicians out, independent transparent process in
PRIME MINISTER:  In 1905, a man travels to a remote island in search of his missing sister who has been kidnapped by a mysterious religious cult
INTERVIEWER:  It needs a multi-pronged approach, doesn't it? What else do you propose to do?
PRIME MINISTER:  Because our party resolved that last year.  An elected Liberal Prime Minister will now have the security of that arrangement over the next term
SHORTEN:  Dusty is a cropdusting plane who dreams of competing in a famous aerial race
INTERVIEWER:  But when you were asked during the course of the campaign are you lifting taxes on super you should say yes, shouldn't you? 
SHORTEN:  It was just madness.  My view is that people's relationships are their own business
PRIME MINISTER:  When Ethan Hunt, the leader of a crack espionage team whose perilous operation has gone awry with no explanation, discovers that a mole has penetrated the CIA, he's surprised to learn that he's the No
INTERVIEWER:  Couldn’t agree more with you on that point.  Prime Minister you’ve got a very busy day ahead selling the Budget, appreciate you doing it live and first here on Sunrise, have a good day
PRIME MINISTER:  Well sorry, we are the Government and we have to implement it
SHORTEN:  A long-lost music producer finds a singer-songwriter right about the moment he has given up all hope on life

PRIME MINISTER:  Singer Freddie Mercury, guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor and bass guitarist John Deacon take the music world by storm when they form the rock 'n' roll band Queen in 1970
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, the only way that you could follow the government’s logic is if you would stop investing in property in Australia
INTERVIEWER:  “We know that people living across north Queensland hugely value their local Medicare and Centrelink services and the decent quality jobs that exist to provide those essential services
SHORTEN:  Our climate change plans will grow the economy, they'll create jobs and they'll lower power prices
PRIME MINISTER:  You shouldn’t pay attention to the bubble Jon, you’ve been around too long to pay attention to the bubble
INTERVIEWER:  On this point though that you’ve exceeded, that your government has exceeded expectations the Coalition record, doesn’t that pitch simply confuse voters along the lines of ‘well, hang on if your record is so good why did you need to dump Malcolm Turnbull?’
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we’re putting money into dams as you know, and there’s quite a number, we’re doing one up in North Queensland in Hughenden, that’s one we’ve been moving on over the last few months
SHORTEN:  A Victorian surgeon rescues a heavily disfigured man being mistreated by his "owner" as a side-show freak

SHORTEN:  You can't have it all ways, you can't say when will you tell people 
INTERVIEWER:  This is what governments do, of course Prime Minister
SHORTEN:  They have invented iView You know it is possible to do an interview at one point in the day - 
PRIME MINISTER:  50 per cent on everything, not just on… it’s on shops, small businesses
INTERVIEWER: You’re getting this costed, aren’t you?
SHORTEN:  Leigh, you know there's no plans for 60 per cent or indeed 50 per cent, but I agree that what we need to do is eventually lighten the burden of income tax across all the levels
PRIME MINISTER:  I mean –
INTERVIEWER:  You’re doing it through something you’re establishing called the North Queensland Livestock Industry Recovery Agency
SHORTEN:  Jack Ryan, as a young covert CIA analyst, uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U
PRIME MINISTER:  That starts now. 
INTERVIEWER: And I’m not sugar-coating anything with that.  Let me ask you about one final area here
PRIME MINISTER:  So I was always trying to be honest with the Australian people about the risk
SHORTEN:  First of all on the pledge, no I am not going to sign it
INTERVIEWER:  It's an attack that has kind of, I was going to say ‘reset’ but it's least caused pause
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah. 
SHORTEN:  Well what we can do is we can make sure that if we are going to provide some support for the wages of early childhood educators, again we will say to the operators if Labor is providing some modest improvement in the wages of childhood educators, if Labor is providing a couple of thousand dollars a year for parents, what we say to the childcare operators is you don't get to pocket that
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, the reaction to the Budget seems to be pretty positive, but there's a couple of things that I wanted to jump into that aren’t as obvious a headline to everyone else
SHORTEN:  Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda are dead.  Now, upon the news of Detective Kerry's murder, two seasoned FBI profilers, Agent Strahm and Agent Perez, arrive in the terrified community to assist the veteran Detective Hoffman in sifting through Jigsaw's latest grisly remains and piecing together the puzzle
PRIME MINISTER:  Welcome to my couch. 
INTERVIEWER:  Absolutely.  So it’s through one Chamber of Parliament
PRIME MINISTER:  Well as the Reserve Bank Governor only said only this week, what we have seen is an improvement in real wages, but there’s still a long way to go and you're not going to get better wage increases without a stronger economy
SHORTEN:  That's right. 
INTERVIEWER:  The hunt has evolved. 
PRIME MINISTER:  [Laughter] I'll struggle through the traffic like every other Australian does here in Melbourne, that’s why we’ve got to bust this congestion
SHORTEN:  That's our aim and the point about it, but just to come to that, we do need to see what numbers the Government have got
INTERVIEWER:  So, I mean as you are going to be Australia's next Prime Minister - 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I can’t offer too much comment on these things this evening, other than to say that in response to these terrorist incidents there is an automatic process which our authorities and police around the country immediately move into
SHORTEN:  Hang on a second.  As you would know as a seasoned journalist, there is always plenty of conversations
INTERVIEWER:  Hopefully many times over the course of the campaign
PRIME MINISTER:  Well they've been able to stand up the facility as we asked them to do a couple of weeks ago
SHORTEN:  In danger of losing his business, Anthony Roca, an ordinary man, develops a scam that will become the heist of the century
INTERVIEWER:  Mankind was born on Earth.  It was never meant to die here
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, we've always made clear that whatever outcome occurs should be after consultation and negotiation with business including small business
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it’s about it being a plan to actually grow the Australian economy and bring us into surplus and invest in the essential services Australians rely on
INTERVIEWER:  Where would you suggest voters in the upcoming federal election put One Nation and the Shooters Party?
SHORTEN:  No.  Let's go to that
PRIME MINISTER:  Yep. 
INTERVIEWER:  Sorry, your main commitment was for a tunnel the people of Victoria people voted against twice in elections
PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
SHORTEN:  Found inside a shining stalk of bamboo by an old bamboo cutter and his wife, a tiny girl grows rapidly into an exquisite young lady
INTERVIEWER:  She is described today as a racist and a bigot.  Is that fair?
SHORTEN:  In this animated retelling of the story from the Bible's Book of Genesis, Joseph's gift of dream interpretation and his brilliantly colored coat inspires jealousy in his brothers
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, it’s always a Coke. 
INTERVIEWER:  Isn't this the most nakedly political budget in Australian history?
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m going to wait to see what he recommends, I’m not going to speculate on it
SHORTEN:  Frederick Abberline is an opium-huffing inspector from Scotland Yard who falls for one of Jack the Ripper's prostitute targets in this Hughes brothers adaption of a graphic novel that posits the Ripper's true identity
INTERVIEWER:  It’s a test for Australia, yeah. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Do you mind if I finish?
SHORTEN:  When Earth astronaut Capt.  Chuck Baker arrives on Planet 51 -- a world reminiscent of American suburbia circa 1950 -- he tries to avoid capture, recover his spaceship and make it home safely, all with the help of an empathetic little green being
INTERVIEWER:  So it's possible, we don't really know. 
SHORTEN:  A college-age brother and sister get more than they bargained for on their road trip home from spring break
PRIME MINISTER:  With the experience –
INTERVIEWER:  Yes ok, you were announcing that during the week.  Listen Labor is managing to stay ahead in the opinion polls Bill, yet you are less popular than Scott Morrison
PRIME MINISTER:  They were always at risk of coming.  That never changes
SHORTEN:  Actually, first things first - I am not going to spend my time bagging the current Prime Minister
INTERVIEWER:  But that's hard not to when they're attacking your child
SHORTEN:  There are a number of points in what you say.  First of all, enterprise bargaining was introduced 25 years ago
PRIME MINISTER:  She’s the bigger legend there’s no doubt about that
INTERVIEWER:  Sure, now in our area though, reef, rainforest, many environmentally sensitive assets as well
PRIME MINISTER:  As it's usually done by most prime ministers?
SHORTEN:  I think you'd be fair enough to acknowledge that then, Adani didn't get the finance but now they appear to have got the finance
INTERVIEWER: You can't afford to lose any seats in WA, can you? But the Labor Party is coming for them
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no.  
SHORTEN:  I enjoyed the debate. 
INTERVIEWER:  I don't assume that there's no cost to doing nothing
PRIME MINISTER: What I’m saying is we’ll continue to ensure that we deliver on this
SHORTEN:  Oh yes. 
INTERVIEWER:  You won't call the election this evening then?
SHORTEN:  Well we’ll release our figures before the election is concluded, but we’ve also made clear that we think we need to wind back what we give to negative gearing

INTERVIEWER:  Okay well speaking wages, Bill Shorten has declared the election will be a referendum on wages
PRIME MINISTER:  the men of the ruined Laketown and the elves of Mirkwood
SHORTEN:  We're going to stick to our existing policies.  It's just not fair for our younger generation to not be able to afford their first home when the Government of the day is giving a tax subsidy to property investors to buy their fifth or sixth
INTERVIEWER:  $20 million for year one, starting right now?
PRIME MINISTER:  Your point is about politics-
SHORTEN:  The incredible true story behind the most controversial Italian court cases in recent years
[FEED DROPS OUT]
INTERVIEWER:  The true story of a day that started like any other
SHORTEN:  Well, I was in Whyalla today, talking to the people who run OneSteel and they made it clear that they're investing in more renewable energy
PRIME MINISTER:  And we are going to stay in surplus over that entire period
INTERVIEWER:  Mother's Day is on May 12th. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's why he's cleaned it up. 
SHORTEN:  No.  What we're going to do is prioritise, and I'll give you the key features of what we're doing
INTERVIEWER:  It's a promise of a surplus of $7 billion next financial year, but how robust is that promise given as we saw in the Budget documents last night, very considerable risks from overseas and risks here care of those falling house prices
SHORTEN:  Well come along to Box Hill today where we’re going to talk more about how we are going to look after early childhood educators
PRIME MINISTER:  That Sharks are playing the Eels mate, so I’m excited about that
INTERVIEWER:  What about though, if they are speaking at a Reclaim Australia rally?
SHORTEN:  Listen, I think what happened is that people just want you to get on with the job
PRIME MINISTER:  We’re going to be spending tens of millions of dollars in Townsville just on the income support payments and the emergency payments alone
INTERVIEWER:  One of the knocks that seems to be coming from the obvious sections of the media, most likely informed by your political opponents, is the only way you get to surplus is because somehow you're skimping on the NDIS
PRIME MINISTER:  NYPD cop John McClane's plan to reconcile with his estranged wife is thrown for a serious loop when, minutes after he arrives at her office, the entire building is overtaken by a group of terrorists
SHORTEN:  No.  You know I did the shopping today in Moonee Ponds where I live and people were saying bring on the Federal Election, and some people would say that Labor has it in the bag, Idon't think that at all
INTERVIEWER:  Yes?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we're not having any preference deals with One Nation, we’re not having any preference deals with the Greens or Labor for that matter
SHORTEN:  We think that there's something that we can work with there, yes
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  So Prime Minister, can I ask about the Australia Day stuff?
SHORTEN:  Who, Rupert Murdoch or Kevin Rudd?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's right and they say they'll still turn boats back
INTERVIEWER:  You have got your five-point plan today, Scott Morrison is going to release a four-point 'blueprint' - so you are one point up, to tackle population policy on Tuesday
SHORTEN:  No listen, I've been very lucky with my team in the last five years
PRIME MINISTER:  No, look that is a misrepresentation of the plan.  What it is is the opportunity for 23 classes for skilled migrants to settle and remain in regional Australia
INTERVIEWER:  I'm well, thank you.  It is an expensive program that you have announced here for 15 hours for 3 year olds now? 
SHORTEN:  While hiding from bullies in his school's attic, a young boy discovers the extraordinary land of Fantasia, through a magical book called The Neverending Story
PRIME MINISTER:  Audrey and Morgan, two thirty-year-old best friends in Los Angeles, are thrust unexpectedly into an international conspiracy when Audrey’s ex-boyfriend shows up at their apartment with a team of deadly assassins on his trail
INTERVIEWER:  No, because I’ll ask this question -
SHORTEN:  I've tried to ring her to find out what she meant but I think to be fair to Labor her comments have come after the last week of Liberal infighting
PRIME MINISTER:  Will Hunting has a genius-level IQ but chooses to work as a janitor at MIT
INTERVIEWER:  Warrior.  Legend
PRIME MINISTER:  Well this has happened before this is not the first time this has happened we have worked through these issues before these are local decisions that are made in these ports I should stress and they don’t represent a very large proportion of coal exports through that port into China in terms of our broader export of coal into China so we will just work through these issues as we have previously it’s not new and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in China has made it very clear that these two things are not related and we take that at their word but I do know this I don’t think a global market for coal being impacted negatively is a wonderful thing, the Labor Party does
SHORTEN:  Whether we’re young or forever young at heart, the Hundred Acre Wood calls to that place in each of us that still believes in magic
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  But there is also the question of leadership, which you have raised
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I choose to have faith in the tremendous relationship between the Australian and Turkish people, which has been experienced by Australians as they've travelled with Kiwis to Gallipoli for many, many, many years and the experience, the hospitality and goodwill of the Turkish people
SHORTEN:  No the deal has to stack up on its own merits.  I do not support putting a single dollar of taxpayer money into this project
INTERVIEWER:  Your office has threatened to sue the Ten Network which raised this allegation on Thursday, for defamation
PRIME MINISTER:  Led by Woody, Andy's toys live happily in his room until Andy's birthday brings Buzz Lightyear onto the scene

SHORTEN:  When Sarah Marshall dumps aspiring musician Peter Bretter for rock star Aldous Snow, Peter's world comes crashing down
INTERVIEWER:  What did you say?
SHORTEN:  No, I'm not going to criticise Kevin there, I think he's entitled to his opinion, he's earned it the hard way and I think also, in answering that question about Mr Rudd that's the difference between Labor and Liberal
PRIME MINISTER:  OK. 
INTERVIEWER:  Oh really? Are you about getting (inaudible)?
SHORTEN:  Well a good analogy I've always used because when I was a union rep sometimes we'd have to have change in workplaces was quite often  I saw corporate leaders say to everyone - use the analogy of a railway station - you're at railway station A and the corporate leaders would say righto to the workforce, you've got to get to railway station B
PRIME MINISTER:  On the quarterly result actually went down, look we should point that out
INTERVIEWER:  Back 2 Work. 
SHORTEN:  Hard-to-crack ex-CIA man, Jack Byrnes and his wife, Dina head for the warmer climes of Florida to meet son-in-law-to-be, Greg Focker's parents
PRIME MINISTER:  Because that’s the right decision. 
INTERVIEWER:  What part of it?
PRIME MINISTER:  Though Kevin has evidenced 23 personalities to his trusted psychiatrist, Dr
SHORTEN:  I always enjoy talking to you guys.  
INTERVIEWER:  Can you report to us on what progress you will be able to make
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah and congratulations to Johnny Morris too, I think he’s going to do a great job down with those Sharks, what do you reckon?
SHORTEN:  So I've had a day off the bus and I'll go back on the bus on Monday
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, I was asking for Speersy and he just wants to know whether we can have a night off, is it the 11th, the 18th or the 25th?
SHORTEN:  Julian, who runs a Thai boxing club as a front organization for his family's drug smuggling operation, is forced by his mother Crystal to find and kill the individual responsible for his brother's recent death
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no Waleed, you've got to be honest with people
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Let’s go to a couple of serious matters now.  Last time you were up here we had that incursion there up at the Daintree, people trying to get into Australia, the boat sank, you know the story
PRIME MINISTER:  Video game bad guy Ralph and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz must risk it all by traveling to the World Wide Web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope's video game, "Sugar Rush
SHORTEN:  I can understand why Malcolm might say that but I have to say when you're Labor and you deal with some of the critique in the media you don't let it distract you from what's important
INTERVIEWER:  So this is the thing; the commentariat, the polls whatever, we all know the game that exists now
SHORTEN:  Tom and Hannah have been platonic friends for 10 years
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t, but I know it takes more than six to eight minutes to charge, I mean crikey
INTERVIEWER:  Thank you for your time this morning.  
PRIME MINISTER:  Sure. 
SHORTEN:  Good morning Edwina. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  For increasingly crowded cities.  Melbourne hit 5 million population yesterday

INTERVIEWER:  Open your mind.  Change your reality
PRIME MINISTER:  It’ll be in May, we’ll call it in April. 
SHORTEN:  After proving himself on the field of battle in the French and Indian War, Benjamin Martin wants nothing more to do with such things, preferring the simple life of a farmer
INTERVIEWER:  Well the election is looming, so?
SHORTEN:  Maybe we need to have a plebiscite  - I don't know
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, exactly what I did do.  The first step, call this out for what it was
INTERVIEWER:  What about my point on debt?
PRIME MINISTER:  No.  What Andrew –
SHORTEN:  A fairy tale love-story about pre-med student Paige who falls in love with a Danish Prince "Eddie" who refused to follow the traditions of his parents and has come to the US to quench his thirst for rebellion
INTERVIEWER:  It’s good when we do have the chance. 
PRIME MINISTER:  They’ve been putting it around the entire gallery for the last three days Michael and I think it's quite appalling that the Labor Party would be putting this about, when they themselves were the ones who did deals in the Senate with One Nation, at the last election
SHORTEN:  James Bond returns as the secret agent 007 one more time to battle the evil organization SPECTRE
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, they’re everywhere. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Christopher Robin, the boy who had countless adventures in the Hundred Acre Wood, has grown up and lost his way
SHORTEN:  First of all, there are concerns that trade agreements provide some disadvantages as well as some advantages
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Do you think, particularly in the circumstances that we face right now, that the Liberal Party and the National Party where relevant, should be preferencing One Nation below Labor and the Greens?
SHORTEN:  And if you don't have an explanation for how you're going to educate the kids or look after the sick or deal with our environment or make sure that we've got economic growth which is in the interests of everyone not just the lucky few, then people are going to say, they're going to look for more extreme solutions and just say no, we're not interested in this version of change which doesn't have a place for us in it
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, we’ve got a series of them. 
INTERVIEWER:  You've enjoyed yourself then?
PRIME MINISTER:  The strategically placed Vegemite sitting there.  I didn’t think there was anything contrived about that
SHORTEN:  A dramatic thriller based on the incredible true David vs
INTERVIEWER:  She can tell her best friend anything, except this one thing
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s alright, Tony was making a lot of sense there, I didn’t want to interrupt him
SHORTEN:  Let's go to Citibank, they're an internationally reputable bank
INTERVIEWER:  But it’s not up to me, it’s a question for you
SHORTEN:  Let's be fair here, Leigh.  Let’s be fair
PRIME MINISTER:  Good morning.  Good to be here
INTERVIEWER:  Some people can never believe in themselves, until someone believes in them
PRIME MINISTER:  No that's the statement that he's made and he had nothing to do with the issuing of the contract, by the way, that had been issued prior and Ministers aren’t involved in those decisions
SHORTEN:  Listen, the Liberals are lying about taxes.  Let's just call it as it is
INTERVIEWER:  On the franking credit issue, you can see that it’s causing you more political harm because it's not grandfathered and you also can see that some of the people who will take the hit here are not wealthy
SHORTEN:  An  U. S
PRIME MINISTER:  A deep sea submersible pilot revisits his past fears in the Mariana Trench, and accidentally unleashes the seventy foot ancestor of the Great White Shark believed to be extinct

PRIME MINISTER:  Frodo and Sam are trekking to Mordor to destroy the One Ring of Power while Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn search for the orc-captured Merry and Pippin

SHORTEN:  Furious that her late father only willed her his gloomy-looking mansion rather than his millions, Carrigan Crittenden is ready to burn the place to the ground when she discovers a map to a treasure hidden in the house
PRIME MINISTER:  Absolutely not, it is a disgraceful smear and an appalling lie
INTERVIEWER:  There's still a page left. 
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s fully funded, no it’s not I think with great respect Keiran it shows a misunderstanding of the issues what this is investing in practices whether it’s in farms, in businesses or in other places to adopt energy efficient and improving technologies and practices which result in a reduction in carbon emissions but they also result in an improvement in productivity
SHORTEN:  Three high school students make an incredible discovery, leading to their developing uncanny powers beyond their understanding

PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
INTERVIEWER:  That’s Bavencio.  Well now I'll let you go because you've now got to talk about the most important economic statement of the week; the Shorten energy statement and I hope you'll prosecute that on behalf of everybody out there
PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
SHORTEN:  First of all, they are 2 different issues. 
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, thank you very much for your time
PRIME MINISTER:  I committed to that last year Jon, why would that change?

INTERVIEWER:  It’s just not fair. 
PRIME MINISTER:  “Guess what, they changed the laws down there in Australia, you can get on a boat now
SHORTEN:  It's about time we had the renewables revolution.  We're proposing to make it easier for households to buy solar powered batteries
INTERVIEWER:  No, as in it's definitely not true?
PRIME MINISTER:  Good on you Leigh.  Good to talk to you
SHORTEN:  Well, I think Mr Porter's problem is that the Prime Minister who he supported for the last three years say's there a problem and for the sake of certainty, you're best off referring it to the High Court
INTERVIEWER:  I don't mind it either.  Good on you Bill, thank you very much
PRIME MINISTER:  Shin-chan is all set to challenge Kung Fu in the Chinatown of Kasukabe city, known as Aiyā Town

INTERVIEWER:  He kills it, he is a very tall human being as well
PRIME MINISTER:  Caesar and his apes are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless Colonel
SHORTEN:  Leigh, let's see how we go in the election first.  We haven't won and we haven't lost
INTERVIEWER:  And a pot and a parma at the pub in Malvern? How often, the health police will be onto you
PRIME MINISTER:  What many are saying is the most disturbing film of 2018, Watch if you Dare revolves around a series of horrifying incidents
SHORTEN:  We haven't finalised our position, but I think that the unions and indeed a lot of people from the Reserve Bank onwards, are all saying that everything is going up in Australia except wages
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  It sounds ten years off. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Good morning Alan. 
SHORTEN:  I think he should receive consular assistance beyond that, I don't know all the facts of the matter and he should deserve the ability to be able to represent it in court which he will be
INTERVIEWER:  How long are you in Brissy for?
SHORTEN:  Yes it is disappointing Lisa.  It's not the way the arrangements are meant to work
PRIME MINISTER:  We’ve got $3. 5 billion dollars worth of initiatives we announced in the Budget last night, because we're meeting our targets for 2030, 26 per cent, we're meeting them
INTERVIEWER:  The Maze Was Just the Beginning. 
SHORTEN: Sorry just to correct, when you say controversial, some in the property industry don't like negative gearing changes but a lot of people actually do like it
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I think that's a fair point to be made to them and this is what David Littleproud and I will continue to do with those very producers and the ACCC as you rightly say should have an important role in that because they have the power to move prosecutions in these cases
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Just to put to you to get a response from you and I know that time is flying, so I’ll keep it as short as possible
PRIME MINISTER:  After being held captive in an Afghan cave, billionaire engineer Tony Stark creates a unique weaponized suit of armor to fight evil
SHORTEN:  Set in 1977, back when sex was safe, pleasure was a business and business was booming, idealistic porn producer Jack Horner aspires to elevate his craft to an art form
INTERVIEWER:  More money going to wages for childcare workers.  Isn't that a reason for whacking up their fees?
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh we’ve got to go again?
SHORTEN:  Can a storybook view of romance survive in the real world?
INTERVIEWER:  Three Saiyans directed by fate. 
SHORTEN:  In a mysterious and remote snowy outpost, Matt and Potter share a Christmas meal, swapping creepy tales of their earlier lives in the outside world, but are both men who they appear to be?
PRIME MINISTER:  I just think this is just appalling.  I mean, as a fan of the game, as fans, that’s who I identify with
INTERVIEWER:  Jimmy Kimmel or something. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well there were a number of cases there that you've talked about where, you know, I've made comments on those at the time
SHORTEN:  An Israeli counterterrorism soldier with a secretly fabulous ambition to become a Manhattan hairstylist
INTERVIEWER:  Which ones?
SHORTEN:  Hope so, see you. 
PRIME MINISTER: I like the blend of experience.  Take Warren
INTERVIEWER:  Fill us in on the details of this one, how will it work?
SHORTEN:  Well I like Melissa.  I think she is an accomplished woman and she was a good Member of Parliament when she was there and she's also worked overseas for the United Nations and refugees so, I like her
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s already taken to account in the Budget.  That's why the Treasurer was able to say last night that we achieved these surpluses while maintaining the discipline of keeping our taxes below the speed limit of 23
INTERVIEWER:  It seems to be fairly specific though Mr Shorten, that Tanya Plibersek says, there is a reason the Labor Party didn't, and leaving it up to the voters of Gilmore to discover what that reason might be?
SHORTEN:  During their travel from Chicago to New York, Harry and Sally debate whether or not sex ruins a friendship between a man and a woman
PRIME MINISTER:  Well look, we’re getting stuff done, the economy is going well, but there is a lot of… you know, this year is going to be a tough year in the economy, so we can’t take this stuff for granted
INTERVIEWER:  The commitments to try and save Sarah Henderson in the very marginal Victorian seat of Corangamite
SHORTEN:  I'd say that's wrong.  Our position's very clear
PRIME MINISTER:  $350 million to combat domestic violence.  That’s what we’re doing on domestic violence
INTERVIEWER:  And Bill Shorten joins us live from Melbourne, good morning to you Mr Shorten
SHORTEN:  I'd say that my view on this mine is going to be based on the best science, whether or not it stacks up, and if it is, if it stacks up and passes all the scientific tests, I won't engage in sovereign risk
PRIME MINISTER:  I will, I’m sure they’ll have an opinion. 
INTERVIEWER:  War never ends quietly. 
PRIME MINISTER:  They’re right across the country, they’re in Labor seats, they’re in Liberal seats, they’re all across the country
SHORTEN:  That's a really good point.  First of all, the government loves to say that if we are not going to give a tax subsidy to a property investor, somehow that’s a property tax
INTERVIEWER:  I don’t get it quite frankly. 
SHORTEN:  Yes, we will, we will support boat turn backs where it's safe to do so, which is existing policy
PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister do you think that the wild weather that we have seen over recent months over Summer has made you know this an even more potent issue in the minds of people in the electorate
SHORTEN:  No that was the other part of your question, I said come back to it
PRIME MINISTER:  No the business case will be done more quickly than that, then you need to get into the advanced planning works
INTERVIEWER:  Do you do that with any of your employees, do you ask them to wear a ski mask?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well -
SHORTEN:  No, not at all.  Did you know Karl that since they have got into power they have doubled the national debt? And what we have also seen is that they've had deficit upon deficit
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, one thing, looking at this in a nutshell; aged care
SHORTEN:  A bigoted junkie cop suffering from bipolar disorder and drug addiction manipulates and hallucinates his way through the festive season in a bid to secure promotion and win back his wife and daughter
PRIME MINISTER:  Yep. 
INTERVIEWER:  Are you better at bringing the party together on this issue than Malcolm Turnbull, is that what you are saying?
SHORTEN:  Cheerio, bye-bye. 
PRIME MINISTER:  So how many rapists – no, let me put this to you Waleed
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Now today in Parliament you said something I found a little bit odd
SHORTEN:  Yes 
PRIME MINISTER:  We're not in a position to do that. 
INTERVIEWER:  What do you make of America confirming overnight that yes indeed it does want to extradite Julian Assange to the United States?
PRIME MINISTER:  Disaster strikes when a criminal mastermind reveals the identities of all active undercover agents in Britain
SHORTEN:  That's right. 
INTERVIEWER:  Why not prime time, that's when we have most eyes and ears
SHORTEN:  I had a dream. 
PRIME MINISTER:  They were written to and they were asked to respond which they did and they provided responses and the police have not sought any further statement from them
INTERVIEWER:  Dr Katie Allen was pre-selected as we just mentioned in Higgins yesterday
SHORTEN:  It won't have an appreciable impact on the price of housing
PRIME MINISTER:  No, because I was at a community fundraiser at the pub
INTERVIEWER:  Is a censure strong enough for Fraser ending in Parliament? Some want him suspended for the rest of the term
SHORTEN:  And the Commonwealth public service. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Look, we’re listening to the experts and I understand that they’ve made it very clear that it’s not a million, that’s not a factual report, it’s in the thousands
INTERVIEWER:  Would it not be a strong act of leadership to say right now that you shouldn't be preferencing in One Nation ahead of Labor and the Greens? It would be an uncontroversial thing
SHORTEN:  That's where the political debate should be - the best ideas 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we have to wait for the business case to be done
INTERVIEWER:  It is a risk though isn’t it?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, once we've completed the business case.  When we were down there launching it the other day, we expect that to be in about 18 months to two years
SHORTEN:  Good on you, Karl.  Have a lovely day
INTERVIEWER:  Has anyone ever looked at you?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, it’s bulk-billing right across the country and including right across northern Tasmania that we’re achieving these rates, that’s the information that I have
SHORTEN:  Advertising executive Nick Marshall is as cocky as they come, but what happens to a chauvinistic guy when he can suddenly hear what women are thinking? Nick gets passed over for a promotion, but after an accident enables him to hear women's thoughts, he puts his newfound talent to work against Darcy, his new boss, who seems to be infatuated with him
INTERVIEWER:  One last chance for peace. 
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, full credit to Daniel Andrews and the State Labor Government
PRIME MINISTER:  No, the election will be called in April and it'll be held in May
INTERVIEWER:  The clear implication, okay, we’re going to get into implication –
SHORTEN:  Thanks guys. 
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day David. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Just let me allude to a speech you made last week, you said it’s important to remind all of us that our economy cannot be taken for granted
SHORTEN:  Based on the classic novel by Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game is the story of the Earth's most gifted children training to defend their homeplanet in the space wars of the future
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I haven't seen the report Leigh, so I’m just going to leave that to 2GB
INTERVIEWER:  On the 1. 25 million jobs that you’re promising if re-elected, of those how many will be filled by migrants?
PRIME MINISTER:  G'day, Michael. 
SHORTEN:  A fair go for all.  We're going to invest in people and invest in infrastructure
INTERVIEWER:  Won’t come back to it. 
SHORTEN:  Well we are putting forward a series of recommendations
PRIME MINISTER:  All good. 
INTERVIEWER:  OK speaking just quickly of Victoria, a three billion dollar cheque you us for a road down here
PRIME MINISTER:  A young girl is transported into a magical world of gingerbread soldiers and an army of mice
SHORTEN:  Because it is costing $6 billion.  The reality is that when you go to hospital it costs a lot more than $2000, I need to find money for our ageing population
INTERVIEWER:  The Australian is suggesting that your carbon credits policy would cost Australians $25 billion
SHORTEN:  We talk about a strong minimum wage, we don't talk about the top two percent of Australians not having to pay tax
PRIME MINISTER:  Well yesterday Alastair MacGibbon I think sort of went into that and it's not clear what the precise purpose of this is at this stage
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  What do you think the prospects are of it going ahead if Labor was to be elected in the next election?
PRIME MINISTER:  That is the great risk we’re now facing.  I’m going to do everything to make sure that doesn’t happen and the only thing standing between a boat and Australia is me and Peter Dutton and our Government
SHORTEN:  An uptight by-the-book cop must protect the widow of a drug boss from crooked cops and gunmen
INTERVIEWER:  What skills do you think Tasmania is lacking?
SHORTEN:  The action-packed and captivating tale of Dee Renjie's beginnings in the Imperial police force
PRIME MINISTER:  Jack Sparrow, a freewheeling 18th-century pirate, quarrels with a rival pirate bent on pillaging Port Royal
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten, I have a question for you and also a question for Mr Beers as well
SHORTEN:  Anyway, so we get the hypocrisy of the process but today's a good day
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no not at all, Leigh.  One of the marks of our economic management is that we’ve always exceeded expectations
INTERVIEWER:  Would you look at changing it so that it, the annual indexation is similar to what happens with the pension?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well you’re, Australia does need a plan for population growth management, that’s one of the things I said when I became Prime Minister and that’s what we’re releasing today
SHORTEN:  Well this is my sixth January as Opposition Leader and what I'm hearing all over Australia, not just Queensland, is people are sick of the instability
INTERVIEWER:  When we take all of the policies that we've talked about tonight, is it fair for a viewer to conclude that a Shorten Labor Government will be at its core about the redistribution of wealth, that you want to take more from the wealthy and give more to people on lower incomes?
SHORTEN:  Thanks for the conversation, Leigh.  It was great
PRIME MINISTER:  Well there is one in every MPs office. 
INTERVIEWER:  OK, one other thing because we're both running out of time here
SHORTEN:  Oh, I'm not getting ahead of myself.  What we're going to do is not focus so much on the Government and the personalities but on our plan for the future
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t make the kids’ lunches. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Well they paid for his tickets. 
SHORTEN:  Four Navy SEALs on a covert mission to neutralize a high-level al-Qaeda operative must make an impossible moral decision in the mountains of Afghanistan that leads them into an enemy ambush
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s not what the Emissions Reduction Fund does, no
INTERVIEWER:  Appreciate your time.  You’re here in Perth, we will come to that
SHORTEN:  You know, it is possible to do an interview at one point in the day and replay it
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, the union movement, yeah.  Look we're not going to take lectures from the Labor Party on this
INTERVIEWER:  - a mad republican you must be incredibly pumped about this royal visit?
PRIME MINISTER:  A biologist signs up for a dangerous, secret expedition into a mysterious zone where the laws of nature don't apply
SHORTEN:  No, it's still got a long way to go.  That would be too arrogant to just assume that the election is over
INTERVIEWER:  Bit it is not a good look, though. 
SHORTEN:  Seen-it-all New York detective Frank Keller is unsettled - he has done twenty years on the force and could retire, and he hasn't come to terms with his wife leaving him for a colleague
PRIME MINISTER:  No it's in the bill and it's the Government's policy
INTERVIEWER:  The question was, will you put the –
PRIME MINISTER:  A ticking-time-bomb insomniac and a slippery soap salesman channel primal male aggression into a shocking new form of therapy
SHORTEN:  No, not at all.  There is still another perhaps up to five months before the election
INTERVIEWER:  Chomp On This. 
PRIME MINISTER:  What we’re talking about here, up in north Queensland
SHORTEN:  We're up for that.  I mean people are sick of just the negativity
INTERVIEWER:  There’s no such thing as that?
SHORTEN:  A retired pop singer turned actress' sense of reality is shaken when she is stalked by an obsessed fan and seemingly a ghost of her past
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh yeah, I saw a bloke zipping along Story Bridge yesterday
INTERVIEWER:  Have you noticed the scooters around? Because Brisbane is like the test city for those electric scooters
PRIME MINISTER:  We are. 
SHORTEN:  The Nazis, exasperated at the number of escapes from their prison camps by a relatively small number of Allied prisoners, relocates them to a high-security 'escape-proof' camp to sit out the remainder of the war
INTERVIEWER:  Ariarne Titmus of course, a Tasmanian local really kicking serious backside nationally and internationally too now, which is wonderful
PRIME MINISTER:  Let me just, this is an important point Neil - the minimum wage isn't the only form of income that people get, who are on those minimum wages
SHORTEN:  The thing giving people smuggler's the best encouragement in 2018 is the constant billboard which the Government do when they say, oh if Labor gets elected, which is possible at the next election, they are egging the people smuggler's on to try their hand again
INTERVIEWER:  But what sort of things are you looking at? What sort of things go on in everyday political life that you want to nail?
SHORTEN:  No.  And the point about it is that she is a strong person
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I want to see it passed through the Parliament and that's what is going to happen
INTERVIEWER:  I understand that figure was from the McKibbin report, isn't that a bit outdated now? 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, not at all.  Jon, that’s just out and out wrong, that's not how it works
SHORTEN:  These guys have got to stop focusing on themselves and do their day job
[Laughter] 
INTERVIEWER:  How would you like to get a concessional loan though, you can’t pay it back
SHORTEN:  I’ll come to cheaper in a second, first of all let’s deal with fair, this is the real reason we’re doing it
PRIME MINISTER:  I’ll just take this one, I’m not faster than Susie right now
INTERVIEWER: Okay sure, but is that track record a problem in the first place?
SHORTEN:  In an attempt to free himself from a state of forgotten limbo, evil dream-demon Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) devises a plan to manipulate un-dead mass murderer Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzenger) into slicing-and-dicing his way through the teenage population of Springwood
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah I do well it’s for exercise but I’m a firm believer that politicians’ exercise should be kept very, not done in public, it’s not a pretty sight
INTERVIEWER:  Have you spoken to or approached the Governor-General to discuss the constitutional impasse that may be on the horizon?
PRIME MINISTER:  Many years ago.  And there are some pretty embarrassing photos of, you know
SHORTEN:  That's alright. 
INTERVIEWER:  Jimmy Kimmel. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Correct. 
SHORTEN:  No.  I just want to reassure Australians that despite the chaos and division that we saw last week in the Government and their inability to explain why they got rid of Malcolm Turnbull, I want to reassure Australians that what we're working on is positive reasons to vote for Labor
INTERVIEWER:  Let me ask you this way -
PRIME MINISTER:  When a stadium is seized by a group of heavily armed criminals during a major sporting event, an ex-soldier must use all his military skills to save both the daughter of a fallen comrade and the huge crowd unaware of the danger
SHORTEN:  Well it’s a matter of priorities.  This is the truth in Australia at the moment
INTERVIEWER:  Now, understandably with everything that happened last week people really want some certainty right now
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s just politics, I mean the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is a very serious and sensitive issue
SHORTEN:  First of all, the first conversation I had for him was to thank him for his service to the nation
INTERVIEWER:  Would I equate it with what Fraser Anning had to say? Would you?
PRIME MINISTER:  No it's more than one, it's well over that –
SHORTEN:  We want to make sure that our defence spending is up to 2 per cent of our national economy
INTERVIEWER:  Over the weekend, your environment spokesman, Mark Butler, said of the Adani mine that he's against it
PRIME MINISTER:  Labor's target at 45% would result in a loss of wages, per wage earner of $9,000 each per year
SHORTEN:  Well, we'll be pursuing it.  It really depends on what sort of pressure the government has brought on the crossbenchers
INTERVIEWER:  Well how do you do that then?
SHORTEN:  All-stars from the previous Step Up installments come together in glittering Las Vegas, battling for a victory that could define their dreams and their careers
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s about connecting our regional areas with our major centres
INTERVIEWER:  A lot have been in marginal seats. 
SHORTEN:  A high school swim champion with a troubled past enrolls in the U
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I’m asking.  When we know who all the candidates are, then that's when I will make my decision and the Party will make its decision about where the preferences go
INTERVIEWER:  You are?
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Neil, good to be with you.  I’m sorry we couldn’t catch up the other day
SHORTEN:  Have a lovely morning guys.  The swimming program is really important, it's good policy
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Alright, so we’ll be at the polls really soon, but you’re not saying when?
SHORTEN:  What's going on in the property market at the moment is the banks are restricting credit
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, they’re matters for a Prime Minister to determine
INTERVIEWER:  Do you feel that you have misread the mood though somewhat on asylum seekers, in terms of medical evacuations as you say in terms of the polling you are up on national security you are up on border protection that’s fine but in terms of the primary vote it hasn’t budged
SHORTEN:  Wart is a young boy who aspires to be a knight's squire
PRIME MINISTER:  If that means that the vote goes down, it will be on Bill Shorten’s head
INTERVIEWER:  At night time - 
SHORTEN:  I don't have that view.  I have made the practice over five years now of not commenting on the polls - good, bad or indifferent
PRIME MINISTER:  I go to church on Sunday mate. 
INTERVIEWER:  Well in that vein I look forward to seeing you twice in the election campaign, thank you very much
SHORTEN:  A passionate holiday romance leads to an obsessive relationship when an Australian photojournalist wakes one morning in a Berlin apartment and is unable to leave
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes, I was acknowledging that there were these fears in the community and that we had to address them, not exploit them
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Because you've never been popular with voters personally
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah and that is true.  So, the suggestion that somehow our health system doesn't provide this for free, now, I think is misleading
SHORTEN:  Oh back in the 80s mate, but neither government has managed to produce a surplus - the Coalition hasn't managed to produce a surplus since they've been in power this time around
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, we thank you for your time this week
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it can provide at that level, I think, it's around about a few hundred bucks
SHORTEN:  In the year 50 BC, Gaul is occupied by the Romans - nearly
INTERVIEWER:  A lot of people make the point that $3000 or $2500 is what pays for their health insurance every year, they make arrangements years in advance based on what you call a gift so why don't you grandfather these arrangements? 
SHORTEN:  Well no, fair's fair.  I do think that people are very disillusioned, but you can't mark me down because we're willing to properly fund education and just dismiss it as spin
PRIME MINISTER:  Interstellar chronicles the adventures of a group of explorers who make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage
INTERVIEWER:  The Opposition Leader joins us now from Mackay in Queensland
PRIME MINISTER:  Of course I do. 
SHORTEN:  A New Jersey guy dedicated to his family, friends, and church, develops unrealistic expectations from watching porn and works to find happiness and intimacy with his potential true love
INTERVIEWER:  Look I’m glad you agreed to take a couple of calls, but we have to snappy or your staff will start waving at me and winding us up
SHORTEN:  Well I think this is a Government to be honest, who have stopped governing
PRIME MINISTER:  I said last night that I think there is a lack of knowledge, or awareness or understanding particularly when it comes to Islam in Australia
INTERVIEWER:  Oh, is that all?
PRIME MINISTER:  It was heartbreaking.  It was devastating, not just there but also over Cloncurry
SHORTEN:  First of all, when it comes to community sector, there was some wage improvement made for them when Labor was last in power
INTERVIEWER:  Well, one of them has. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well our form is there for people to see.  There are two other very big generationally-delayed projects which we’re now getting on with
SHORTEN:  Víctor is a child who is found casually roaming by a country road
INTERVIEWER:  What about Bill Shorten, have you ever. 
SHORTEN: Well, you know and I know, Fran, that if we don't have the numbers, it can't be done
PRIME MINISTER:  Well done Susie, well done. 
INTERVIEWER:  The fact that even more companies will now be able to claim up to $30,000, This means you get to, people reinvest in their business and now they get to keep even more of their own money
PRIME MINISTER:  We're not taking that policy to the next election, no
SHORTEN:  Yes.  There's already 50,000 batteries installed around Australia
INTERVIEWER:  I don’t, no, and that wasn’t the implication that I was making
PRIME MINISTER:  And let me say in this plan we've announced today we're providing incentives for those students to actually go and study in regional areas by giving them an additional a year of work rights
SHORTEN:  Well, there's no doubt that it's going to take a while, but we've got to start
INTERVIEWER:  So what do you make of Malcolm Turnbull’s advice then?
SHORTEN:  Well if I can put it really directly, do people want a government or do they want a piece of plasticine
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I wanted to see it passed through the Parliament and that's what you have to do to be pragmatic
INTERVIEWER:  What a Lovely Day. 
SHORTEN:  A paranoia-fueled action thriller about an unsuccessful writer whose life is transformed by a top-secret "smart drug" that allows him to use 100% of his brain and become a perfect version of himself
PRIME MINISTER:  Dunno. 
INTERVIEWER:  OK.  But I guess in a way that's sort of the point
PRIME MINISTER:  So do I, it is diabolical. 
SHORTEN:  Ok, but I'm happy to contribute, though. 
INTERVIEWER:  So don’t pass, just say you don’t know and move on
SHORTEN:  I think that is one of the questions of the ages.  The member for Manila, but Jason's been our representative in northern Australia so I might get him to talk further
PRIME MINISTER:  I'm just trying to answer your questions.  I was raising the issue –
INTERVIEWER: Prime Minister bulk-billing, that’s another one.  There’s basically no bulk-billing doctors here in Launceston and in fact probably across northern Tasmania
SHORTEN:  We do think that Western Australia has had a bad deal in the past, but we've got to make sure that if we legislate to give a better deal to Western Australia, which is what Labor has called for, that we just make sure that no other state is worse off
PRIME MINISTER:  When the creator of a popular video game system dies, a virtual contest is created to compete for his fortune
INTERVIEWER:  I’m not suggesting –
SHORTEN:  Listen, I think some of our time zone differences are absolutely crazy, but I also know that every state has got very long held views on this issue
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I think it’s pretty clear since we’ve come to Government, we’ve got the Budget  back into surplus
INTERVIEWER:  Partially leaked to the Australian newspaper. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Set in the 22nd century, The Matrix tells the story of a computer hacker who joins a group of underground insurgents fighting the vast and powerful computers who now rule the earth
SHORTEN:  Hang on, you have five questions there.  Let's do them one at a time
INTERVIEWER:  Why is it difficult? Why is it a difficult question?
PRIME MINISTER:  Misuse of union funds by the AWU, Bill Shorten’s union
SHORTEN:  Well, you keep going on cost.  I want to say to you let's get this straight
INTERVIEWER:  China says media speculation on this is heightening tensions between the two countries, is that right?
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah we had a Politics in the Pub last night and then sort of moved more generally
SHORTEN:  There they go again, the government.  They already sound like they're backpedalling on making the banks accountable
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, good morning.  Welcome
SHORTEN:  Police chief Brody must protect the citizens of Amity after a second monstrous shark begins terrorizing the waters
PRIME MINISTER:  The film depicts the plight of a female office worker whose boss introduces to the world of pornographic films
INTERVIEWER:  This is going to take a while.  It's not exactly a renewable revolution if only 100,000 people can do it?
PRIME MINISTER:  $36 billion will leave the country to go over and get carbon credits from Kazakhstan or wherever else they think they're going to get them from
SHORTEN:  I haven't seen those remarks.  But I think what you said in the preamble is correct
INTERVIEWER:  But it's something that just as a bloke, it’s got to feel good
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I was hoping that I would be able to stop the Labor Party from weakening our border protection
SHORTEN:  We're committed to putting in place anti-bulling programs
INTERVIEWER:  If you lose though? As you said before it is a tough job
PRIME MINISTER:  Light years from Earth, 26 years after being abducted, Peter Quill finds himself the prime target of a manhunt after discovering an orb wanted by Ronan the Accuser
SHORTEN:  Secure within a desolate home as an unnatural threat terrorizes the world, a man has established a tenuous domestic order with his wife and son, but this will soon be put to test when a desperate young family arrives seeking refuge
INTERVIEWER:  I thought Tina Arena was your singer of choice and yet we’ve got ACDC Back in Black - not quite back in the black though, we're still back the red at the moment this year, aren’t we? 
PRIME MINISTER:  Of course we are, and that’s exactly why I was up there today and that’s the next phase of the recovery
SHORTEN:  I think there is disillusionment with institutions generally
[Inaudible]
INTERVIEWER:  It couldn't be wrapped up and then responded to between now and the May election, could it?
SHORTEN:  That's good. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No that’s actually not true, Leigh, I mean doing what we’ve pledged today on jobs would actually not be at the peak rate of jobs growth that we’ve achieved over the last couple of years so I think that-
INTERVIEWER:  So does that mean it is possible that you will be preferencing One Nation ahead of Labor and the Greens?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I’ve asked you the same question and you’re saying ‘no rapists’
SHORTEN:  Lovely, cheerio. 
INTERVIEWER:  It is pretty much his plan, isn’t it, the one he floated?
PRIME MINISTER:  Because I don't believe it's supported and I think one of the things we learnt through that process is that there's a lot of work to be done by large businesses in this country to regather the trust of the Australian people that would see them support such an initiative
SHORTEN:  Yeah I think that there is - and it's not just the regions
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  No it wasn’t the Labor Party actually, I’m not even aware of what the Labor Party…
SHORTEN:  I think it is a range, I don't think it's one stereotype at all
PRIME MINISTER:  No, it can’t actually Jon, you can’t.  That bill in any form was going to weaken our border protection laws
INTERVIEWER:  Surprise? Disappointment?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, you’re the one who said that they’re cutting taxes
SHORTEN:  By all means. 
INTERVIEWER:  OK, Prime Minister, thank you for talking to us this morning
SHORTEN:  It won't have a negative effect on economic growth
PRIME MINISTER:  I just want stuff that works, David.  That’s what I want to do
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah the problem is, if we had the economy that was going and that we had jobs and we could create an income for ourselves, the problem itself we could almost manage
PRIME MINISTER:  Well who is creating that perception? The Labor Party have
SHORTEN:  Sure. 
INTERVIEWER:  And an endorsed candidate I assume. 
PRIME MINISTER:  When teenager Elle's first kiss leads to a forbidden romance with the hottest boy in high school, she risks her relationship with her best friend
SHORTEN:  Well I actually think that people want to look beyond the next opinion poll to what are we going to do for them and their families
INTERVIEWER:  So even though conservative politicians bag renewables, the actual Australian public is adopting it
SHORTEN:  Oscar Diggs, a small-time circus illusionist and con-artist, is whisked from Kansas to the Land of Oz where the inhabitants assume he's the great wizard of prophecy, there to save Oz from the clutches of evil
PRIME MINISTER:  Sure, of course. 
INTERVIEWER:  You’re comparing it to the direct statement of Fraser Anning –
SHORTEN:  Retired C. I
PRIME MINISTER:  They should, you’re dead right Neil.  People should cooperate with police investigations and my Ministers have
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, yesterday we heard from Julia Banks who is from your home State of Victoria
SHORTEN:  Well we've got to find out why it happened and what happened
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, we’ve got to get up to Cooktown. 
INTERVIEWER:  The Federal Government is unveiling a population policy today
PRIME MINISTER:  Is at complete odds –
SHORTEN:  dodgeball.  Aided by a dodgeball guru and Goodman's attorney, La Fleur and his rag-tag team of underdogs launch a knock-down, drag-out battle in which the winner takes all
INTERVIEWER:  Good on you.  Thanks, Mr Shorten
PRIME MINISTER:  Well our forecasts are always conservative.  As you know unemployment is now at 4
SHORTEN:  Well we are winding back the negative gearing tax concessions on future houses and we are also making other changes to the system of taxation, which will see that some tax concessions which are given to the top end won't be so generous in the future, and instead we're going to use that money to educate the next generation of Australians
INTERVIEWER:  So will you and the girls be delivering Jenny breakfast in bed, or will you perhaps be too busy on the campaign trial?
SHORTEN:  Well I have to let the Caucus members have a say, I don't run a top-down organisation, but I think personally Pat Dodson is an outstanding Australian, an outstanding West Australian
PRIME MINISTER:  The Grinch hatches a scheme to ruin Christmas when the residents of Whoville plan their annual holiday celebration
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Correct. 
SHORTEN:  Well, I've known Scott Ryan for some period of time
PRIME MINISTER:  Well if you’re walking around the building, yeah there are those as well
INTERVIEWER:  Now more importantly, how is the first pup, Buddy, doing?
SHORTEN:  Yeah, but do you know what? For the last six years we have been debating the Liberals
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I'm still getting reports in of exactly what they've decided to do and what the legal force of that is
INTERVIEWER:  Alright.  I don't want to make you late for your next appointment and we've gone well over time already
PRIME MINISTER:  No there’s not. 
SHORTEN:  A young couple living in a Connecticut suburb during the mid-1950s struggle to come to terms with their personal problems while trying to raise their two children
INTERVIEWER:  Among? Two among? Three among? 50 among?
SHORTEN:  Well, the Government is playing catch up with Labor in terms of putting more money back into the Catholic schools system
PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister –
PRIME MINISTER:  No it wasn’t Jon.  It wasn’t
SHORTEN:  I choose to invest in schools and hospitals, reducing the aged care waiting list, making sure people can get apprenticeships, making sure that we can reduce the out-of-pocket costs in Medicare
INTERVIEWER:  Just on the Greens, they want to end coal mining by 2030
PRIME MINISTER:  And it’s important that this character doesn’t get the opportunity to go and spread and incite hatred if under their system - and it’s their system - he were to be released
SHORTEN:  It will be a matter for the legal system to proceed, he should receive the support any other Australian citizens should receive, the matter is going before court so I don't think there is much more I can add
INTERVIEWER:  She would love that, thank you indeed. 
SHORTEN:  What we have said is that we are going to review the Newstart allowance
PRIME MINISTER:  As leader it's my job to ensure that the tone I set, is the right tone
INTERVIEWER:  How many?
SHORTEN:  Well he already is and this is the real heart of the issue
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m not disputing that, I’m just saying it actually went down in the last quarter
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER: Alright Mr Shorten you both get the chance to be fair dinkum tomorrow across in Perth, the first leaders’ debate being broadcast on the Seven Network tomorrow and we’ll see you there
SHORTEN:  Well, I want to try and answer -
PRIME MINISTER:  The marriage of Yin Nan and Mei Ai (He Zhixing) has lasted for eight years
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Homework can wait.  The city can't
SHORTEN: What does that mean, he's not going to assassinate someone? I mean, sorry, but if you want to change the era I think the Liberals need to do some time in opposition to understand how fundamentally people don't like this
PRIME MINISTER:  No we don’t, because we really still don’t even know the full extent of the losses
INTERVIEWER:  Well, that's what they thought last time and then didn't turn out that way at the end of the term
SHORTEN:  We'll change that when we get into government because I don't agree with that
PRIME MINISTER:  A husband and wife, who are poles apart, go through a lean patch after they start living separately
INTERVIEWER:  Stories live forever.  People don't
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks John, great to be here with you. 
SHORTEN:  Not at all, it depends if you want federal tax money or not
INTERVIEWER:  Do you know what we’re excited about up here? It’s the 48 day party to celebrate the 250th anniversary of James Cook and the Endeavour
PRIME MINISTER:  I have no intention of doing that, I just simply want people to report the truth and that is an ugly and disgusting lie
SHORTEN:  Jerry, a small-town Minnesota car salesman is bursting at the seams with debt
INTERVIEWER:  In the short term, in the first four years, you’re providing tax relief for the same group Labor is
SHORTEN:  A hotshot Washington criminal lawyer becomes the target of a rogue security executive videotaped in the act of murdering a congressman when the incriminating tape is surreptitiously slipped into his shopping bag by the videographer, who is fleeing the executive's assassins
PRIME MINISTER:  We’re just doing the right thing for Australia’s borders
INTERVIEWER:  The Labor landslide on Saturday will have federal implications
PRIME MINISTER:  He’s been nowhere near Flinders. 
SHORTEN:  I think that putting in a black and white legislation just puts it beyond doubt
INTERVIEWER:  They’re all wrong?
SHORTEN:  We can legislate to restore the penalty rates on Sundays and public holidays that have been cut
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we can.  It's a function of getting the business case landed and it's a function of getting the agreement together with the State Government
INTERVIEWER:  Let me clarify Mr Shorten, it may be fair dinkum but you've still got on your hands the fact that you, and the Government, are prepared to let children languish in detention
PRIME MINISTER:  No not yet. 
SHORTEN:  Set in the Depression-era Franklin County, Virginia, a bootlegging gang is threatened by authorities who want a cut of their profits
INTERVIEWER:  Do you think she would she be a good person for the job?
SHORTEN:  No.  I have got to say that what concerns me is the waiting list that someone - the waiting time that someone has to get an elective surgery
PRIME MINISTER:  People say things sometimes –
INTERVIEWER:  But it is also about women.  What is the great disadvantage of taking too few women in the Liberal Party ranks to the next election?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I can only say anyone who may have talked to a journalist to smear me in that way
SHORTEN:  I have no plans to review the approvals.  But if we want to be fair dinkum, let's be fair dinkum and let's tell the voters the truth here, all of us
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten, we've covered a lot of ground tonight
SHORTEN:  Well, changing the Constitution is very difficult
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks a lot, I look forward to it. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Is that where some of the secrets are all done?
PRIME MINISTER:  Exactly and that's why we'll work on those 25,000 payments and their extension
SHORTEN:  Yes, we've got to have more diversity in our media, got to hear more voices, can't just be the same old couple of large media companies in Australia
INTERVIEWER:  The only thing crazier than love is family. 
SHORTEN:  Well there's no doubt that there's lessons federally and you've mentioned a whole range of seats where there was a significant swing to Labor
PRIME MINISTER:  I mean, that’s all part of the plan. 
INTERVIEWER:  Because you’re not allowed to eat Maccas, you’re not allowed to eat parmas, you’re not allowed to drink beer
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m talking about schools, hospitals and Medicare, Fran, and it’s all gone up
SHORTEN:  give in to the terrorists and sacrifice his family, or risk everything to uphold his principles - and the integrity of the nation
INTERVIEWER:  After.  I've just robbed a bank but I'll give the money back
SHORTEN:  I will let the review look at all of those issues, that is a legitimate issue
PRIME MINISTER:  It's a moot point. 
INTERVIEWER:  Okay.  To come back to this immigration thing, 160,000
SHORTEN:  If we want to talk about conflicting positions, let's be even handed here, Leigh
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, it was on Sunday. 
INTERVIEWER:  Well they're entitled to. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it's not quite clear what they've done and how that will play out
SHORTEN:  Sorry what was the last bit of your question?
INTERVIEWER:  Sorry, say that again? You think I said what?
PRIME MINISTER: Well I always said there would be additional initiatives and there are in fact the Emissions Reduction Fund and the flagging of additional investment was set by Tony Abbott back in 2015 so this is a continuation of those programs and that is why I have always been so confident and why am I so confident because the 2020 targets we will exceed by over 400 million tonnes and when we came to Government we inherited a deficit of more than 700 million tonnes and we turned that around through these programs we will be one of the few countries in the world that will have exceeded our targets in 2020 by that type of amount well beyond many of the others who are often claimed and out to 2030 we have the plan to get us to hit those targets in a canter as well so our record speaks for itself we meet the targets that have been set for us that we have set ourselves and we will meet them in the future and they are sensible
SHORTEN:  Snoopy embarks upon his greatest mission as he and his team take to the skies to pursue their arch-nemesis, while his best pal Charlie Brown begins his own epic quest
INTERVIEWER:  So you didn't ask her to stand down? 
PRIME MINISTER:  Good on you, Jon. 
SHORTEN:  I'd welcome an overdue look at the aged care sector in Australia
INTERVIEWER:  Yep. 
SHORTEN:  Fiscal responsibility is important, I don't accept the Liberal argument that somehow Dan Andrews isn't fiscally responsible, they've made some very strong decisions
PRIME MINISTER:  No and Julie Bishop said exactly the opposite, as did Kelly O'Dwyer
INTERVIEWER:  Evil Has Reigned For 100 Years. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Look that’s true.  That is true and we have to confront our inadequacies as a country but we don’t have to be overwhelmed by them, equally
SHORTEN:  Because for the last three years, and indeed six years, we have been united
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, yeah. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah one to seven and 14 – 1 for mental health services
SHORTEN:  I think there is a bit of a difference there Baz.  First of all, what we are saying is that in workplace relations, just one set of laws
INTERVIEWER:  So are you worried about what the scientists might discover?
SHORTEN:  Well I think that is essentially Mark's judgement, that he doesn't think it is going to happen and he doesn't support it
PRIME MINISTER:  They're substantially funded by state governments
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Well Prime Minister I know you need to leave so we do appreciate your time this morning
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I think the proof is the policy I am announcing today
SHORTEN:  Super.  Thank you
INTERVIEWER:  Do we clone Scott Morrison’ so you can try and get around more places than you otherwise can?
PRIME MINISTER:  That was the clear implication Waleed.   
SHORTEN:  Well, prices go up and prices go down.  It really depends if you're trying to buy or sell a house
INTERVIEWER:  90. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well as you already noted there has been sort of movement on this as we've seen reported today
SHORTEN:  Well, fair's fair.  In the six years that the current government have been in, Labor has been united
INTERVIEWER:  Well, $200 billion of tax, I mean -
SHORTEN:  Wow.  
PRIME MINISTER:  Jon, that’s not true…
INTERVIEWER:  Why not aim higher if things are going so well?
PRIME MINISTER:  A live-action adaptation of Disney's version of the classic tale of a cursed prince and a beautiful young woman who helps him break the spell
SHORTEN:  Well, let’s go back to this.  When you give a tax credit to someone who is not paying income tax, that is a gift
INTERVIEWER:  One final one for you, I was thinking about you at length the other day, not that I do a lot of that -
SHORTEN:  It's not even true so it's not that tough to counter
PRIME MINISTER:  I have.  Look, all the best of Australia is on display in Townsville, as you’d expect it to be
INTERVIEWER:  Because?
PRIME MINISTER:  Sure. 
SHORTEN:  Sure.  But I actually think Sale Secondary College is also important
INTERVIEWER:  The true enigma was the man who cracked the code. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah?
SHORTEN:  Cheers. 
INTERVIEWER:  Let’s talk a little bit just about the impending election as well
SHORTEN:  You've declined.  I am sorry if you are busy at lunchtime
PRIME MINISTER:  No, it’s not Fran.  It’s just a simple fact
INTERVIEWER:  They said that you could include in Kerryn Phelps’ legislation…
SHORTEN:  No, what we are able to do is we are prioritising schools and hospitals over creating richer multinationals and more tax minimisers in you know, Caribbean Islands
PRIME MINISTER:  I know but Alan that has to come in them as 160,000 cap
INTERVIEWER:  Well you just reminded me it goes back to 2005. 
SHORTEN:  Oh no I don’t accept that, I accept that what we are doing is creating fairness
PRIME MINISTER:  It all depends where they are.  I mean they're there in a conflict zone currently, so I'm not going to put any Australian diplomat or any other Australian in a position of risk to go and extract anyone from these situations
INTERVIEWER:  No, I don’t. 
SHORTEN:  When a young boy makes a wish at a carnival machine to be big—he wakes up the following morning to find that it has been granted and his body has grown older overnight
PRIME MINISTER:  There’s an inland sea.  I saw it was making its way down through the Gulf
INTERVIEWER:  Another policy, the energy policy, the NEG, the National Energy Guarantee, is certainly dead to the Government
PRIME MINISTER:  In a small town in Massachusetts, four high school girls perform a ritual in an attempt to debunk the lore of Slender Man
SHORTEN:  A man struggles with memories of his past, including a wife he cannot remember, in a nightmarish world with no sun and run by beings with telekinetic powers who seek the souls of humans
INTERVIEWER:  Sorry but who do you know who did it or not?
SHORTEN:  Well whilst I'm not running for Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, especially as Michael Gunner is doing such a good job, gee the new Gunner Government was left with a lot of problems by the outgoing administration, the CLP-run people
PRIME MINISTER:  Lots of members lobby about lots of things. 
INTERVIEWER:  You’ve provided your explanation, fine, people will just draw their own conclusions on that
SHORTEN:  A deaf woman is stalked by a psychotic killer in her secluded home
PRIME MINISTER:  In an alternate present-day version of Oakland, black telemarketer Cassius Green discovers a magical key to professional success – which propels him into a macabre universe
INTERVIEWER:  But how much ambiguity? Christian Porter points out there now - that you've got the situation now where you need absolute certainty, otherwise you want to refer it to the High Court?
SHORTEN:  Liquidated after discovering a corporate conspiracy, mild-mannered graphic artist Patience Phillips washes up on an island, where she's resurrected and endowed with the prowess of a cat -- and she's eager to use her new skills 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we’ve both always been on that side, for a long time
INTERVIEWER:  Big infrastructure spending.  What, $100 billion over the next few years? I’ve got to say, you must be a fan of Utopia, the TV series because you’re creating a National Fast Train Authority
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I can't afford to lose any seats anywhere in the country
SHORTEN:  Well, it has caused havoc and some can argue the rule is outmoded but it wouldn't be my immediate priority
INTERVIEWER:  What do you think?
SHORTEN:  Good, that's good.  There you go
PRIME MINISTER:  I've already answered that question previously.  We will be determining that at the time of nominations closing, because frankly, there are many candidates for who should go last
INTERVIEWER:  And temporary protection visas.  That cost us 16 billion dollars
SHORTEN:  We need to see the final detail.  Anyone who says that they can commit to something that they haven't seen is selling you something which isn't real
PRIME MINISTER:  No.  This is the big lie of what Labor's been saying about their tax plan
INTERVIEWER:  No further changes?
PRIME MINISTER:  Scientist Will Rodman is determined to find a cure for Alzheimer's, the disease which has slowly consumed his father
SHORTEN:  A couple with a newborn baby face unexpected difficulties after they are forced to live next to a fraternity house
INTERVIEWER:  Excellent, we like that. 
SHORTEN:  Well, I've got a general rule in life that you’re always better talking than having a standoff
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I look forward to your support and we will be doing it
INTERVIEWER:  And the duplication to Waurn Ponds, allocating $50 million over four years, but it's a $750 million project
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I’m not making any statements on that…
SHORTEN:  Kit, a troubled girl, is sent to the exclusive Blackwood boarding school, where she discovers that only four other female students have been admitted to learn the four pillars of knowledge under the ominous wing of the mysterious headmistress Madame Duret
INTERVIEWER:  But if you - if you reject the assertion -
PRIME MINISTER:  People won’t have to wait too long to find out.  But obviously, there were three dates, the 11th, 18th and 25th  and those options are now narrowing, so I don’t think people will have to wait too much longer
SHORTEN:  There's 250 companies caught by our safeguards mechanism, the same safeguard mechanism the current government applies to 120, each company will respond differently
INTERVIEWER:  Ita Buttrose, not on the list, of possible chairs, of the board of this organisation the ABC but certainly well-placed sources in today’s newspapers say even though there were no men on the list that was put to Cabinet, Ita Buttrose may leapfrog the field?
SHORTEN:  In 2019, Lincoln Six-Echo is a resident of a seemingly "Utopian" but contained facility
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s a very customised plan.  We have a plan to keep our economy strong and we have a plan to keep the Tasmanian economy strong
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Just moving on Prime Minister?
SHORTEN:  I just didn’t realise that we had a technophobic government who is afraid of new technology
PRIME MINISTER:  I absolutely didn’t agree with what she did in the Parliament, when she wore the burqa to Parliament
INTERVIEWER:  Thank you for your time this morning. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Good on you Neil, cheers mate. 
SHORTEN:  An uproarious version of history that proves nothing is sacred – not even the Roman Empire, the French Revolution and the Spanish Inquisition
INTERVIEWER:  Welcome to the Real World. 
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.   Because some of those policies were unpopular
SHORTEN:  All right, good chat.  Thank you
INTERVIEWER:  We’ll certainly be watching and supporting, absolutely where that does happen
SHORTEN:  Well, let's sort out population, cost of living, workers’ rights, build a strong economy to make it work in the interest of everyone - 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, all I’m saying at this stage is that we will never do a preference deal with One Nation and that we will settle those matters at the time of nominations closing, when we know who all the candidates are
INTERVIEWER:  I’m trying to answer your question. 
PRIME MINISTER:  We are not going to do any preference deals with One Nation
SHORTEN:  When the girl that detective Joe Hallenback is protecting gets murdered, the boyfriend of the murdered girl attempts to investigate and solve the case
INTERVIEWER:  But as I said, when we go through your policies, a lot of where you're getting your revenue from is taxes on wealthy people, closing loopholes that mostly wealthy people can exploit and you're wanting to spend money on lower income people
SHORTEN:  Babe is a little pig who doesn't quite know his place in the world
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  On social media, you mentioned the campaigns to blacklist companies
PRIME MINISTER:  I go to church in Sydney, yeah. 
SHORTEN:  A naive young man assumes a dead man's identity and finds himself embroiled in an underground world of power, violence, and chance where men gamble behind closed doors on the lives of other men
INTERVIEWER:  The Prime Minister is with me, Scott Morrison good morning
PRIME MINISTER:  Well what if Fraser Anning is running candidates?
SHORTEN:  The story of British officer T. E
INTERVIEWER:  But would I be correct in saying the area that's been hacked has a lot of personal details and on a lot of voters?
SHORTEN:  In terms of the commercial high jump bar, yeah they've passed that
PRIME MINISTER:  But they don’t. 
INTERVIEWER:  When you were just out of school. 
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, I understand the frustration of Australians about crowded infrastructure, and our immigration should be what's in the national interest but part of that debate has to be fixing up our infrastructure
PRIME MINISTER:  And when Kyoto was set Fran, it was set on the basis that you could carry over credits
INTERVIEWER:  And I was thin. 
SHORTEN:  No, I’ll tell you what my Labor colleagues they are adults, they can sign or not
PRIME MINISTER:  Ex-hitman John Wick comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from him
INTERVIEWER:  When the Coalition was elected in 2013 it was on the back of promises to end Labor's debt and deficit nightmare and to rein in what you said was Labor's out of control spending
SHORTEN:  We will have a good look at them.  We have backed 15 sets of changes
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah he has, we got a response the other night.  I have also written to him again, that letter crossed over on my second because I was very disturbed at the appearance of Hakeem at the hearing the other day
INTERVIEWER:  Where is the evidence of that Prime Minister with these numbers?
SHORTEN:  An eternal romantic falls in love with the girl his father has decided to get him married to, but will his past love affair prove to be a problem?
PRIME MINISTER:  I'll tell you why it's important.  Because this year's Budget, the year we're currently in, which was the Budget I handed down last year, we have bettered what I said a year ago by around about $10 billion and in the previous year, we did exactly the same thing
INTERVIEWER:  But equally Prime Minister how much of this congestion is due not so much to migration, but state governments of both stripes, not thinking strategically and thinking ahead, building your roads, building your rail lines many, many years ago?
SHORTEN:  A fast-talking lawyer transforms his body and takes a vow of silence, not to be broken until he finds out who killed his wife and daughter and has his revenge
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Kier, it's great to be here in the studio and great to be here in Cairns again
INTERVIEWER:  But he was the head of the Labor Party. 
PRIME MINISTER:  When you're running deficits, obviously your debt continues to increase Leigh, that's why it's so important to get the Budget back into surplus
SHORTEN:  Well, that will be up to the people of Australia, but I think our message is one which resonates
INTERVIEWER:  I’d be dropping that every day. 
SHORTEN:  Well I made the decision, when they first proposed having the plebiscite I thought it was the wrong process, I thought it was an abdication of leadership but then I thought why on earth should we let some Australians go through this process on their own
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I think we're not going to sugar-coat to the public the implications of laws passing the Parliament and Waleed, it's important that you don't either
INTERVIEWER:  No, it wasn't clear to me on that point, sorry.  Does that mean -
SHORTEN:  our tax system is making it harder for our young ones, our millennials, the younger people to be able to even buy their first home
PRIME MINISTER:  It is a great story and these are the stories we’re looking to be told with this re-enactment of that voyage
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten, Julia Banks specifically mentioned both parties
PRIME MINISTER:  I want to make some simple points.   Yes, we know of course we must address climate change and more importantly, we have been
SHORTEN:  We had a bus long before Scott had it, and we've even been on the bus!
INTERVIEWER:  Ok
SHORTEN:  No.  Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand, the Labour Prime Minister there, went to a series of countries on provisions which a conservative government had signed up to, and executed letters with those countries and both countries agreed not to go ahead with that
PRIME MINISTER:  How can it be ‘too little, too late’ when what we’ve put in place means we exceed our targets by 367 million tonnes? Explain that to me
INTERVIEWER:  Well we talk about Medicare.  
PRIME MINISTER:  What you've just said. 
SHORTEN:  Well, we'd have to see the numbers and decide if we wanted to do that
INTERVIEWER:  What have you got on Sunday?
PRIME MINISTER:  You too. 
SHORTEN:  There's no doubt that if we back renewable energy, renewable energy is cheaper than existing forms of power in the future
INTERVIEWER: Prime Minister, cost of living.  In a recent poll, it’s come out on top as the key election issue
SHORTEN:  Set in Las Vegas, the film centers on a man who attends his best friend's bachelor party, unaware of an insidious agenda that plays into hunting humans
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Ben. 
INTERVIEWER:  One Way… One Fate… One Hero. 
SHORTEN:  "Dirty" Harry Callahan is a San Francisco Police Inspector on the trail of a group of rogue cops who have taken justice into their own hands
PRIME MINISTER:  Then when we put that together, it works exactly like we work the Melbourne Airport Rail Link
INTERVIEWER:  And I think the public feel that way as well and it is political
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks very much Sabra. 
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, the issue of climate change has been getting away from Australia for the last ten years
INTERVIEWER:  I know you're tight on time so let me squeeze in a few more and I thank you very much for calling in by the way, we appreciate it
PRIME MINISTER:  This is the leader of the Labor Party in New South Wales who was has said Asians are going to take people’s jobs
SHORTEN:  Yes, Labor believes that we need to fund more preschool
INTERVIEWER:  Related.  So you are confirming that you are not going to sign this CFMEU pledge to not stand in the way of Adani
SHORTEN:  Well we are going to review it.  First things first - I do think Newstart is too low
PRIME MINISTER:  We've just increased the payment and for providers
INTERVIEWER:  And they were the most trusted news outlet in the country
PRIME MINISTER:  Ethan and team take on their most impossible mission yet—eradicating 'The Syndicate', an International and highly-skilled rogue organisation committed to destroying the IMF
SHORTEN:  Using a special camera that can see spirits, a family must protect their daughter from an evil entity with a sinister plan
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  “I’m doing everything legally. ” But they’re running people back tens of thousands of dollars
SHORTEN:  There's a point of difference but not the one he's claiming to make
PRIME MINISTER:  90. 
INTERVIEWER:  So is that only Brisbane?
PRIME MINISTER:  No, Jon, none of that is true. 
SHORTEN:  Pakistan-born comedian Kumail Nanjiani and grad student Emily Gardner fall in love but struggle as their cultures clash
INTERVIEWER:  You have a very strong voice within that Party. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no it’s great to be here, thanks for the fun and thanks for the opportunity to-
SHORTEN:  Fletcher Reede is a fast-talking attorney and habitual liar
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  You like it?
PRIME MINISTER:  Vignettes weaving together the stories of six individuals in the old West at the end of the Civil War
SHORTEN:  It'll be great.  Long overdue
INTERVIEWER:  Earlier today, we spoke to the Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg
PRIME MINISTER:  The Scorpion King teams up with a female warrior named Tala, who is the sister of The Nubian King
SHORTEN:  Well, between five to six years, we've seen the recoup in the solar panels
INTERVIEWER:  Now you have expressed already, can I say, disappointment in the release, the early release of Abu Bakar Bashir
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I wanted to see the payment passed through the Parliament and the Labor Party and others, you know, we were aware of the position and I wanted to see passed
SHORTEN:  The parents of a soon-to-be married couple make the final preparations for the wedding ceremony
INTERVIEWER:  Some of that shouting and hot air has come from your side of the ledger
SHORTEN:  A young man struggles to access sublimated childhood memories
PRIME MINISTER: They sought to solve a problem that didn't exist. 
INTERVIEWER:  I'm not talking about them, I am talking about the CFMEU
SHORTEN:  Of course we want people to get off the dole and get a job
PRIME MINISTER:  V A C U U M. 
INTERVIEWER:  Let's assume people weren't focused though, for example when you get asked through the course 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, Jon, what I’ve got is a sensible, practical policy which is based on reducing our emissions, which we need to do and have done, and a plan to keep doing that out to 2030 and meet our targets which will see emissions per capita fall per person by more than 50 percent and our emissions intensity fall by more than two thirds
SHORTEN:  Yeah, okay. 
INTERVIEWER:  You’re not the bad guys.  We are
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s just what she told you herself.  That’s what she said, that’s what her public statement is and that’s a matter for Julie
SHORTEN:  Who gets on the front bench is ultimately decided by the Caucus
INTERVIEWER:  When peoples’ voting intention…
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I will say, I don’t care where the power comes from, so long as it’s reliable and it turns up every day…

SHORTEN:  BSAA Chris Redfield enlists the help of government agent Leon S
INTERVIEWER:  Good on you.  Just on letters, to get away from all of this, you actually have written to the Prime Minister of Thailand about that soccer player Hakeem which I find a disgraceful episode, he’s gone there
SHORTEN:  Lucky Luke becomes the Sheriff of Daisy Town and runs out all the criminals
PRIME MINISTER:  Through a series of daring escapades deep within a dark and dangerous criminal underworld, Han Solo meets his mighty future copilot Chewbacca and encounters the notorious gambler Lando Calrissian
INTERVIEWER:  But the suggestion was our ready to go.  So how many applications have been made?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, that’s not gonna happen.  I’ve spoken to the Minister this morning, the service will go ahead at dawn as usual
SHORTEN:  Okay sure. 
INTERVIEWER:  What was your reaction when you saw the list?
PRIME MINISTER:  Labor had a lot to say about that, so where is Bill Shorten today? Tanya Plibersek? Anthony Albanese? When it comes to the leader of the Labor Party in the New South Wales Parliament –
SHORTEN:  Well, you made a preamble to this question.  I have answered questions on climate change many times, many times
INTERVIEWER:  The bill made clear that they could be denied on those grounds and so they wouldn't get they into the country in the first place
PRIME MINISTER:  We work constructively with China.  I've met with [inaudible] as well as the President and we have a very important relationship with China and I'm very positive about particularly the economic growth of China
SHORTEN:  Blonde Betty Elms has only just arrived in Hollywood to become a movie star when she meets an enigmatic brunette with amnesia
[FEED DROPS OUT]
INTERVIEWER:  Do you understand though that when you frame the issue in that way, that creates an environment of prejudice? Or do you think that's not what happens?
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks, Leigh great to be with you. 
SHORTEN:  A group of surviving people take refuge in a shopping centre after the world has been over taken over by aggressive, flesh-eating zombies
INTERVIEWER:  A couple of quick ones to finish on.  Labor has announced today a levy on banks
SHORTEN:  I've spoken to him a few times.  But I notice the conspiracy of the far right against Malcolm Turnbull
PRIME MINISTER:  Not all the time, I’ve got to say, on occasion I have… that’s been raised with me on occasion
INTERVIEWER:  And affordable. 
SHORTEN:  After watching their respective partners die, a cop and a hitman form an alliance in order to bring down their common enemy
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I have.  So again Waleed, look to the experience that I've laid out for you tonight and don't prejudge me
INTERVIEWER:  Well I hope so, because we want to keep you accountable, we are all voters
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes, I did that ages ago. 
SHORTEN:  extortion.  To achieve his goal, he recruits musclemen Paul and Adrian as accomplices
INTERVIEWER:  Do you plan to fund this out of any savings that you plan to make to the Budget should you win government?
PRIME MINISTER:  The little witch is only 127 years old – too young for the annual coven of witches
SHORTEN:  A young boy whose parents just divorced finds an unlikely friend and mentor in the misanthropic, bawdy, hedonistic, war veteran who lives next door
INTERVIEWER:  Could Julie Bishop have beaten Bill Shorten if she was PM?
PRIME MINISTER:  Nah, I don’t go a thickshake. 
SHORTEN:  A newly possessed cheerleader turns into a killer who specializes in offing her male classmates
INTERVIEWER:  OK.  Christian Porter just told us earlier that he's been lobbying hard on this one
SHORTEN: Absolutely we do, and I certainly think the decision -  because it should be for the new government whoever they are, Liberal or Labor 
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks mate, cheers.   
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  So that is our government… the Australian government’s plan?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well –
SHORTEN: I think, Fran, is this the way we want immigration laws and strong borders being made by people whose constitutional eligibility has a cloud over it? 
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, thank you very much for joining us
SHORTEN:  the fabled Bracelet of Anubis.  Unfortunately, a newly resurrected Imhotep has designs on the bracelet as well, and isn’t above kidnapping its new bearer, Alex, to gain control of Anubis’s otherworldly army
PRIME MINISTER:  Henri “Papillon” Charrière, a safecracker from the Parisian underworld, is wrongfully convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in the penal colony of French Guiana, where he forges a strong friendship with Louis Dega, a counterfeiter who needs his protection
INTERVIEWER:  But he was making his, that was the worst picture by the way, but he was making his kids’ sandwiches with wholemeal bread
PRIME MINISTER:  In Stockholm, Sweden, hacker Lisbeth Salander is hired by Frans Balder, a computer engineer, to retrieve a program that he believes it is too dangerous to exist
SHORTEN:  I think you just said earlier on that it was just, in very recent moments, that Tanya made that comment so, I haven't seen them
INTERVIEWER:  They do. 
SHORTEN:  Kevin McCallister's parents have split up.  Now living with his mom, he decides to spend Christmas with his dad at the mansion of his father's rich girlfriend, Natalie
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we’ve announced half a billion dollar water infrastructure fund
INTERVIEWER:  And one as we mentioned before about the PBS, that was actually able to help people last night
SHORTEN:  Well Mr Morrison will have to call an election in the next five months, they have to
PRIME MINISTER:  Genius Belgian detective Hercule Poirot investigates the murder of an American tycoon aboard the Orient Express train
INTERVIEWER:  How many? How many of those 60?
PRIME MINISTER:  What we've done over the last five and a half years is increased funding for hospitals by over 60 per cent
SHORTEN:  We can afford to do this because we are making the tough economic decisions
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  So Newspoll’s result on this issue specifically, in the last little while, would suggest that the parties are level-pegging on that topic…
SHORTEN:  We need an independent national broadcaster.   
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh I don’t really care but so long as they’re safe and they don’t run into people
INTERVIEWER:  Left with nothing.  Capable of anything
SHORTEN:  Thank you.  In terms of the treatment of the children on Nauru, I have been watching very carefully what the AMA have been saying
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that’s exactly what Labour set out when they announced that they were going there in the first place
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  If they hear you, they hunt you. 
SHORTEN:  Well I tell you what the numbers on me were the same before the State Election as they are now, but we’re doing pretty well
PRIME MINISTER:  And that’s what the process will determine. 
INTERVIEWER:  Well it depends how flat your battery is. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well this is right.  In cases when you take in all the benefits and so on, you can have cases of people earning up to 80,000 a year and they pay no net tax
SHORTEN:  First of all, the election hasn't been held. 
INTERVIEWER:  We appreciate you calling in, when are you heading back our way?
PRIME MINISTER:  We established the Skilling Australians Fund last year Jon, that was in last year's Budget
SHORTEN:  Yes, let's do that, Leigh.  That would be great
INTERVIEWER:  Can I ask you Mr Shorten, there's been a lot of talk about values and as we approach Australia Day, the Prime Minister certainly has been putting forward views
SHORTEN:  The Coast Guard makes a daring rescue attempt off the coast of Cape Cod after a pair of oil tankers are destroyed during a blizzard in 1952
PRIME MINISTER:  Well our commodity price forecasts for example are well below, right now, what the price is
INTERVIEWER:  You’re listening to RN Breakfast, our guest is the Prime Minister Scott Morrison on his way to Townsville to offer this reconstruction package for farmers
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s a mystery Ben. 
SHORTEN:  Oh, two questions, OK. 
INTERVIEWER:  It’s been done hasn’t it?
SHORTEN:  Yeah you're right, we did want to see it but the problem is Mr Turnbull couldn't even bring it to the Parliament and we encouraged him to, we thought this was a good thing to do but this is the big problem in Australia and I didn't want to talk too much about my opponents
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t think you believe that’s true either. 
INTERVIEWER:  That’s it, clusters of as you say, clusters of teenagers, kids as young as 12 and even younger
SHORTEN:  Well, but are they Jon when you think about the issue that Australians haven't voted for Scott Morrison
PRIME MINISTER:  Well who?
INTERVIEWER:  We’ve seen evidence in those hearings of banks effectively stealing from customers, for example charging people for financial advice that they never intended to provide, would you expect criminal charges to flow from the Royal Commission?
PRIME MINISTER:  You mean particularly after Friday?
SHORTEN:  I think that we can miss out on what's happening around the world, you know climate change and the investment in renewables is one example but I think your question is going to a deeper point
INTERVIEWER:  Heroes don't get any bigger. 
SHORTEN:  Well we want the subsidy to go to the parents and what we're going to say to child care operators though is that we don't want them ramping up the prices
PRIME MINISTER:  I’ve been in the job for just over six months, one of the first thing that it was we we got this dam project underway up in Hughenden
INTERVIEWER:  Well, to those on your side, who have been holding up or even saying there is no need for further action on climate change, what do you say to them today?
SHORTEN:  Maybe not the lollies.  See you, bye
PRIME MINISTER:  No worries. 
INTERVIEWER:  Mischief.  Mayhem
PRIME MINISTER:  Why? Because they wanted to encourage countries to overachieve…
SHORTEN:  The subsidy will be for parents.  If your household income is up to $68,000 we will provide a 100 per cent subsidy up to the capped amount of $11
INTERVIEWER:  Thank you.  Isn't this issue starting to get a bit away from you? Is it a bit glib to blame News Limited? Shouldn't you announce the costings, bring that forward, bring voters in on your plans?
SHORTEN:  I certainly don't think the outcome of the next election is at all decided
PRIME MINISTER:  I think it's rubbish. 
INTERVIEWER:  Discover what made her the girl. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Investigative journalist Eddie Brock attempts a comeback following a scandal, but accidentally becomes the host of Venom, a violent, super powerful alien symbiote
SHORTEN:  His unholy sexual passion for his sister, his marriage to Rome's most infamous prostitute, his fiendishly inventive means of disposing those who would oppose him, and more
INTERVIEWER:  With an election looming and the Prime Minister's approval rating at an all time low, Labor has launched its bidding for your vote
SHORTEN:  An IRS agent with a fateful secret embarks on an extraordinary journey of redemption by forever changing the lives of seven strangers
PRIME MINISTER:  Well not under our laws, but they can under Labor's
INTERVIEWER:  When you are quoted as saying you will meet your targets in a canter, you were including this money? You had this in mind?
SHORTEN:  So, we're committed to our reforms to make our budget sustainable
PRIME MINISTER:  Mt.  Doom, the only place where it can be destroyed
INTERVIEWER:  Yes, they don't want the councils.  They're worried about the council, it’s separate from the graziers
SHORTEN:  The fact that bank said this tells me a couple of things
PRIME MINISTER:  So how can they be providing more tax relief when they’re actually halving the amount of tax relief that is currently legislated before the Parliament?
INTERVIEWER:  Well, do you think Pauline Hanson supports you on that philosophy?
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, it is just a nonsense claim.  It is a nonsense claim and it is built upon the back of a big lie
PRIME MINISTER:  I agree.  And when this matter was brought to my attention, I dealt with it
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Peter Hughes is a survivor of the 2002 attack and says he is angry at the early release
PRIME MINISTER:  And in comes the big dark hand of Labor to rip it out of your pockets
SHORTEN:  if you want to keep driving a petrol car, you can
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Leaders are born from survival. 
PRIME MINISTER:  [Laughter] I think that’s great too. 
SHORTEN:  One thousand years after cataclysmic events forced humanity's escape from Earth, Nova Prime has become mankind's new home
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Okay - 
SHORTEN:  We want to put forward positive views.  Some people say the Government's such a disorganised shambles, just sit back and buy a box of popcorn, but the point is that puts more pressure on us, because people think the system is broken
PRIME MINISTER:  There’s been no reduction in funding.  I mean we asked the ABC to actually do the same thing that every single Department and agency has to do in terms of an efficiency dividend, which they weren’t required to do for years and years and years
INTERVIEWER:  You have written though Mr Shorten…
PRIME MINISTER:  Thank you Sabra. 
SHORTEN:  NYPD detectives Christopher Danson (Johnson) and P
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  All heroes start somewhere. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I believe it will, but it’s going to take a lot of work to get there
SHORTEN:  Batman and Nightwing are forced to team with the Joker's sometimes-girlfriend Harley Quinn to stop a global threat brought about by Poison Ivy and Jason Woodrue, the Floronic Man
INTERVIEWER:  After the Budget, okay that’s pretty fair. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Against his father Odin's will, The Mighty Thor - a powerful but arrogant warrior god - recklessly reignites an ancient war
SHORTEN:  In a dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods
INTERVIEWER:  Can you see him?
SHORTEN:  A troubled psychologist is sent to investigate the crew of an isolated research station orbiting a bizarre planet
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I am saying we have a clear plan based on a great track record of which Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott were key parts of putting together and driving that success
INTERVIEWER:  Love is an act of defiance. 
PRIME MINISTER:  In the dark heart of a sprawling, anonymous city, two assassins carry out a sinister mission, a teacher battles a fatal illness, and an enigmatic janitor and a curious waitress lead dangerous double lives
SHORTEN:  Well I don't buy what you are selling there, but I will go to this point, I did say that I don't comment on polls - good or bad, but if Mr Morrison, if he thinks that he is doing really well at the moment go and ask his Victorian colleagues
INTERVIEWER:  Could the resurrection of Clive Palmer cost you the election? 
SHORTEN:  In a futuristic world where the polar ice caps have melted and made Earth a liquid planet, a beautiful barmaid rescues a mutant seafarer from a floating island prison
PRIME MINISTER:  They were actually published –
INTERVIEWER:  Well why would we need to with all this pumped hydro
PRIME MINISTER:  I'll send you the details. 
SHORTEN:  Just hang on, hang on, gentlemen, ladies, we've a fair go at this press conference, perhaps I'll allow one more question and then we got to finish up, we've got to go to Tiwi
INTERVIEWER:  Did she say literally that you personally were responsible?
SHORTEN:  No, she has strong views.  I like Melissa
PRIME MINISTER:  This is so important and we're changing when you set the threshold as well
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Thickshake?
PRIME MINISTER:  I’ve got another tough Western Australian behind me and they just stay focused on what their job is and what their responsibilities and their accountabilities are
SHORTEN:  We believe that anyone who comes here via people smuggler should be resettled in a third party nation, yes
INTERVIEWER:  No, no, I get that you want to speak for yourself, but it is important to focus on the Coalition generally
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's a terrible lie, Jon. 
SHORTEN:  – sure 
INTERVIEWER:  Pray For Forgiveness. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, Leigh, I mean, just as well I’m a fighter when you listen to what you’ve just relayed out there which is I think is a particularly pessimistic way to look at things
SHORTEN:  Ms McGowan has always said she's concerned about all of the people in detention, not just the kids
INTERVIEWER:  Tony Abbott says the era of assassination is over?
SHORTEN:  It will work cooperatively and constructively.  I always had the view, back from my days representing workers in negotiations with employers, that no one has got a monopoly on having all the good ideas
PRIME MINISTER:  They’re matters for the US and not for me to comment on
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah let’s hope they’re listening and they start using it for good and not for evil
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's why you need your economy to be strong and the only people are going to get a wage rise under Bill Shorten are the people smugglers
SHORTEN:  Well the franking credits, that's still prospective
INTERVIEWER:  You've likened political interference in the ABC to a dictatorship, we're sick of the ABC bias towards Playschool
PRIME MINISTER:  But the Tax Office – if the Labor Party says they support our tax cuts, then the Tax Office can administer it on that basis
SHORTEN:  Nada, a wanderer without meaning in his life, discovers a pair of sunglasses capable of showing the world the way it truly is
INTERVIEWER:  Absolutely, the sky didn't fall in. 
SHORTEN:  CIA Analyst Jack Ryan is drawn into an illegal war fought by the US government against a Colombian drug cartel
PRIME MINISTER:  Lara Croft, the fiercely independent daughter of a missing adventurer, must push herself beyond her limits when she finds herself on the island where her father disappeared
INTERVIEWER:  52-48 two party preferred.  Based on that, it would be a landslide to Labor
PRIME MINISTER:  Well again, whatever we might say would be a matter that I would consult with the National Security Committee of Cabinet
SHORTEN:  Well what we want to do is create a level playing field, first of all
INTERVIEWER:  Right, that's probably a very good move.  It was a huge result though
SHORTEN:  OK let's go through each of those three points very briefly
PRIME MINISTER:  My last advice on all of those of whom there were some serious concerns on character issues, I think was over about 50
INTERVIEWER:  Okay well what do you say –
SHORTEN:  Barrie, is this Liberal government, this protection racket for the banks scandals and rip-offs we’ve seen, are they really telling Australians that the only way that we can have a banking sector is to have an unethical banking sector? I don't buy that, nor do thousands of farmers and small businesses and people who have been ripped off by the banks
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, it’s going to depend on people’s holding.  But it’s going to be a hell of a lot lower than they’re paying right now
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Do we need to upgrade Border Force because of this incident?
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t know what he was talking about. 
SHORTEN:  When Russia's first nuclear submarine malfunctions on its maiden voyage, the crew must race to save the ship and prevent a nuclear disaster
INTERVIEWER:  Now, there was another story in the papers this morning that we didn't get to but you've written to the Prime Minister asking him to support a National Integrity Commission, which is basically a commission to keep an eye on politically elected people, politicians -
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I can, and I'm also fortunate to have people of the calibre of Senator Dodson here and I might give him a run on the ball, but I'll just make this
PRIME MINISTER:  The real choice is who is going to be the Prime Minister after the next election
INTERVIEWER:  So you’re in Sydney on Sunday?
SHORTEN:  I think the nation is sick and tired after ten years of arguing about climate change that we just don't get on with it
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s exactly what happens, that’s exactly what happens
INTERVIEWER:  On the line is the Prime Minister Scott Morrison.  Good morning
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I think it’s important to continue the Dawn Service in the way it’s been done
SHORTEN:  It was a big time.  I remember, of course, that two men got killed and another two were badly burnt
INTERVIEWER:  Okay…
SHORTEN:  No, that wouldn't be right.  What we want to do is have real change, because, frankly, more of the same under this government isn't good enough for Australians -
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t think it would get you from Northies to North Cronulla, I don’t think it’d get you that far
INTERVIEWER:  Did anyone. 
SHORTEN:  Well no, Fran, what I'm not going to do is engage in that debate
PRIME MINISTER:  I'm sorry, this is his own Party. 
INTERVIEWER:  We’re going to go, you’ve got to go somewhere else
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m committed to winning the next election, and in the Liberal Party…
SHORTEN:  Well, what we'll do in our way is we’ll put more investment in the Territory
INTERVIEWER:  I want to talk about your Budget. 
SHORTEN:  We will once we have announced all of our policies
PRIME MINISTER:  They do. 
INTERVIEWER:  The images that we saw over the summer break, and I know you’ve commented on this but I haven’t had the chance to talk to you about this
SHORTEN:  This movie was followed by a sequel (The Japanese Wife Next Door – Part 2) which features the exact same cast, but follows Takashi’s fate if he had married Mina (the other woman he shared the drink with that night) instead
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I mean if that's what the Labor Party have to rely on - and I thought their response today to the Budget was the most feeble I've seen in a long time
INTERVIEWER:  In the latest Newspoll Labor is ahead of the Coalition on a two party preferred basis, 55-45 meaning you and Labor would win any election held today
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, or even less on a concession that's right, $6
SHORTEN:  Nicky, a veteran con artist, takes a novice named Jess under his wing
INTERVIEWER:  This is about rebuilding and reconstruction.  Despite all this help though, do you think the North Queensland cattle industry will ever be the same?
SHORTEN:  Yes, I understand that linkage.  But what I want to make clear and they are two separate issues
PRIME MINISTER:  In your commentary on these things, all journalists I think, have to be careful that they don't create a false impression of the risks that need to be managed
INTERVIEWER:  Expect the Impossible. 
SHORTEN:  What we want to do, and we think, without question, the preferred position will be to refer it off to the High Court - let's get resolution
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I know what the accusations are.  I was accused of that when the boats were turning up thick and fast when we were in Opposition and people said I wouldn't be able to, as a team, turn it around
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Have they warmed to you? I mean you’ve been out and about over the summer break, do you get the feeling that Australia is now used to Scott Morrison being their Prime Minister and they like it?
SHORTEN:  18-year-old Penny Cooper spent years pining for Johnny Sanders Jr
PRIME MINISTER:  We’re doing all of these things Jon. 
INTERVIEWER:  All hail the king. 
SHORTEN:  Young Shakespeare is forced to stage his latest comedy, "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter," before it's even written
PRIME MINISTER:  Of course there is.  There's always that
INTERVIEWER:  The park is gone. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m sure you’ll always be on air, I’m sure your viewers will be demanding that you be on air all the time
SHORTEN:  Well that's good he went there, I'm not going to complain about that, that's good he went there
INTERVIEWER:  Are you going to guarantee all these measures? We have heard fast train plans for the last 20 years and none of them have ever got up
SHORTEN:  Yeah no, that’s somewhere with the Burberry trench coat
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I'm not saying at this point, because when I've made that final decision, when I go out to see the Governor-General, that's when that will be public
INTERVIEWER:  And Joe Hockey likewise?
PRIME MINISTER:  An other-worldly story, set against the backdrop of Cold War era America circa 1962, where a mute janitor working at a lab falls in love with an amphibious man being held captive there and devises a plan to help him escape
SHORTEN:  I tell you what, the last Prime Minister or the last leader who worried about the polls, is probably watching this on iView from New York
INTERVIEWER:  Okay tax is one side of it, but the other side is wage increases
PRIME MINISTER:  There’s not.  There’s one phone, and it’s this one, and it rings all the time
SHORTEN:  we are grandfathering our proposals.  Most people don't know quite what grandfathering means
INTERVIEWER:  You should open a detention centre there.  What's the point of going to the polls, if in fact migration policy and refugee policy is going to be determined by doctors?
SHORTEN:  Six years have elapsed since Guantanamo Bay, leaving Harold and Kumar estranged from one another with very different families, friends and lives
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, when you’re in deficit your debt goes up and it has taken us the last 6 years to get the Budget out of deficit and get it back into surplus
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Just add chaos laughter awkwardness mistakes love
SHORTEN:  If you want to talk about bullying, how about that LNP trying to threaten Melissa Price's job?
PRIME MINISTER:  Ben, you are absolutely right.  And mate, I saw those same reports as I’m sure you did over the break and I’m not pleased you’ve raised it for the obvious reasons but I am glad you’ve raised it, if you know what I mean
INTERVIEWER:  But - 
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, we have said that if you currently negatively gear, you will keep negative gearing
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I think it’s just fundamental economics 101, Leigh
INTERVIEWER:  Right, these are powerful points.  See, if you take the Capital Gains Tax
SHORTEN:  Let's say it as it is, the Australian people are so far ahead of the politicians on renewable energy it's not a joke but what I am going to do if we get elected is we're backing renewables, we're backing the batteries, we want people to get between a 60 and 90 per cent reduction off their household bills
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh I’ve been here all week, I’m heading back down to Sydney tonight
INTERVIEWER:  Thank you for what you’re doing and we’ll talk again, we hope
PRIME MINISTER:  …out of their bottom smear draw because they were under pressure in the Parliament
SHORTEN:  It is up to them.  
INTERVIEWER:  Which was obscene and which was wrong, but sometimes Pauline Hanson … she won’t even condemn Fraser Anning
SHORTEN:  Do you know what? I think Mr Dutton should refer himself
PRIME MINISTER:  Captain Glass of the USS “Arkansas” discovers that a coup d'état is taking place in Russia, so he and his crew join an elite group working on the ground to prevent a war
INTERVIEWER:  What's your advice today though, Prime Minister, to those thousands of Australians who are planning to go to or may already have booked to go to Gallipoli next month for ANZAC Day?
SHORTEN:  Yes, for the vast bulk of people we are offering the same thing
PRIME MINISTER:  Given the country's overcrowded prisons, the U. S
INTERVIEWER:  Can you put us out of our misery - everyone has to ask you at the end right – when will the election be Prime Minister?
SHORTEN:  About a million Australian families will benefit from our initiative on child care
PRIME MINISTER:  Hi Deb. 
INTERVIEWER:  You’re going to vote against the bull?
PRIME MINISTER:  One year after outwitting the FBI and winning the public’s adulation with their mind-bending spectacles, the Four Horsemen resurface only to find themselves face to face with a new enemy who enlists them to pull off their most dangerous heist yet
SHORTEN:  Cab driver Max picks up a man who offers him $600 to drive him around
INTERVIEWER:  Doesn't it set a precedent for the Federal Government to pay wages for other private sector workers in the form of direct subsidies?
PRIME MINISTER:  I think that's what the bubble worries about.  But what Australians are going to decide at the next election –
SHORTEN:  Yes, but it is a development.  Also there's a Nationals Member of Parliament, perhaps a quiet achiever is what you would call him, Mr Hogan up in Page, and he's said he's going to sit on the crossbench as well
INTERVIEWER:  The reports are in Nauru though, limited medical evacuations and stopped remote assessment by doctors
SHORTEN:  Well, my absolute conviction and belief, is that if we don't change, then the cost will be far greater than any initial investments
PRIME MINISTER:  No, not even the ABC. 
INTERVIEWER:  … it can be ameliorated and improved. 
SHORTEN:  lower the prices, take real action on climate change and ensure reliability
PRIME MINISTER:  Great to be back Leigh. 
INTERVIEWER:  Big meets bigger. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I would. 
SHORTEN:  Well I don't think this country is getting a better deal from the third Liberal Prime Minister in five years
INTERVIEWER:  We had a hint of those headwinds yesterday.  Were you worried about those economic figures out yesterday? They were indicating if it wasn't for population growth we'd be in recession
PRIME MINISTER:  Batman raises the stakes in his war on crime.  With the help of Lt
SHORTEN:  In the future, a strange fungus has changed nearly everyone into a thoughtless, flesh-eating monster
INTERVIEWER:  Have you ever said when a kid goes Dad can you do something, you go gosh I thought I was the Prime Minister?
SHORTEN:  Well I think you've got to work on that.  We've got to make the kids safe
PRIME MINISTER:  I think you’re sort of self-revealing there, mate
INTERVIEWER:  You have – let me finish this. 
PRIME MINISTER:  But he's got a thing called Gumnut Designz and they're selling hats to raise money for Sisters of the North which is supporting those local charities up there
SHORTEN:  Yeah.  I would pick a more positive number than costs
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  – and whenever they listen to yourself speaking or the Prime Minister speaking, they just think this is all spin?
PRIME MINISTER:  They provided a response and the police have accepted that response and they haven't sought any I'm advised, any further statement
SHORTEN:  Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt return as heads of the Baker family who, while on vacation, find themselves in competition with a rival family of eight children, headed by Eugene Levy,
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Let's talk about lifting the poorest people up.  In a Budget boasting $45 billion worth of surpluses Prime Minister over four years, why was there no scope at all to raise the Newstart Allowance?
PRIME MINISTER:  That is a separate process which continues to be underway which is agnostic about what the source of reliable energy is and that is a separate process
SHORTEN:  There will be no change to existing investors. 
INTERVIEWER:  If you say don’t know I’ll just go straight on to the next question
SHORTEN:  Yes.  I mean, the Prime Minister, you said something that he said which deserves answering and this is the first occasion I've had to answer it since his remarkable press conference
PRIME MINISTER:  England, early 18th century.  The close relationship between Queen Anne and Sarah Churchill is threatened by the arrival of Sarah's cousin, Abigail Hill, resulting in a bitter rivalry between the two cousins to be the Queen's favourite
INTERVIEWER:  People are looking at the hiccups and stumbles at a time like this when you are focusing on an upcoming election, and such was the case yesterday afternoon, where you were seen to not answer a question that was asked by a journalist, and we have another question from a listener from Owen, asking what are the costings for your renewables and greenhouse gas emission policies, you owe it to the people of Australia to be transparent on this
SHORTEN:  Well all the research and science and experts make it clear that the more early years learning we can give our kids before they go to school, it just absolutely, quantum improves their learning experience at schools
PRIME MINISTER:  Sure. 
[Inaudible]
INTERVIEWER:  Now you’ve gone in hard over the past fortnight to try and discredit Labor on border protection
SHORTEN:  The place would erupt if if they rolled him.  
PRIME MINISTER:  Well of course it does.  So does reliable energy
INTERVIEWER:  That’s the one you answer straight away. 
SHORTEN:  A tough Russian policeman is forced to partner up with a cocky Chicago police detective when he is sent to Chicago to apprehend a Georgian drug lord who killed his partner and fled the country
PRIME MINISTER:  They’ve already voted for it. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Now, how the hell does he manage? There’s no electric ute on the market
PRIME MINISTER:  Teddy Walker is a successful salesman whose life takes an unexpected turn when he accidentally blows up his place of employment
SHORTEN:  To the best of my knowledge, no Labor candidate believes three year old child care is a political conspiracy
INTERVIEWER:  Given this poll out today, are you disappointed with that, that you haven’t had a bounce in the polls? Because you made a big thing of the difference between your policy and also the Opposition’s in terms of Medivac and asylum seeker boats
SHORTEN:  We will in principle.  I mean it would have to be a pretty amazing reason not to
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah. 
INTERVIEWER:  But…
PRIME MINISTER:  Not only those but also people who had serious character assessments –
SHORTEN:  Of course. 
INTERVIEWER:  It’s also what the providers are saying -
PRIME MINISTER:  True. 
SHORTEN:  Well, if you think we're catching, if you think that we are hearing all of the insider deals that go on well I don’t share that view
INTERVIEWER:  So no validity at all, you won't be taxing more -
PRIME MINISTER:  He already is. 
SHORTEN:  Sherlock Holmes and Dr.  Watson find themselves in 1890s London in this holiday special
INTERVIEWER:  Various Labor candidates and MPs have had differing positions on Adani, it seems a little confusing what the party's actual position is
PRIME MINISTER:  Waleed, the other night, you were very emotional and I’m sure you may have said some things about me, that based on our conservations since, you think may have been a bit over the top, about my own motives when it comes to these issues
SHORTEN:  After defeating Frieza, Goku returns to Earth and goes on a camping trip with Gohan and Krillin
INTERVIEWER:  Because he’s the Prime Minister. 
PRIME MINISTER:  There only needs to be one Waleed, that’s my answer
SHORTEN:  And it didn't exist before we got there but I spent a lot of time talking to people with disability and their careers and then we built up a coalition of people who really wanted to see a better deal
INTERVIEWER:  Not yet?
PRIME MINISTER:  Absolutely, as I just said, in the last two budgets we bettered what we said we would do, by $10 billion each year
SHORTEN:  If you don’t start – you are quite right, and what sort of world are we passing on to the next generation? We know this government is paralysed on climate change, and if they weren’t, Malcolm Turnbull would still be the Prime Minister, wouldn’t he?
INTERVIEWER:  How will people in remote communities be able to hold off severe bushfires was one that (inaudible)?
PRIME MINISTER:  What today is is about a comprehensive plan for Australia's future population growth
SHORTEN:  As America's stock of athletic young men is depleted during World War II, a professional all-female baseball league springs up in the Midwest, funded by publicity-hungry candy maker Walter Harvey (Garry Marshall)
INTERVIEWER:  But most people dress up for an event like this right, and if someone really wants to embrace Aussie culture by wearing traditional Aussie clobber, why stop them?
SHORTEN:  First of all it’s a silly policy and it’s a policy that isn't going to happen
PRIME MINISTER:  Once it was drawn to his attention, he paid it back
INTERVIEWER:  No, no that’s not what I asked.  How many murders, rapists and paedophiles? It’s an important question because that's –
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we did and have been. 
SHORTEN:  I think we are, but I think some of the shenanigans at the top level and the personality conflicts has left people disillusioned, but the way we will get around that is that we'll just go back to a more independent process to pick the senior leadership of the ABC
INTERVIEWER:  I need to get through this question.  Will you at the very least committed in every seat, to putting them below the Labor Party and the Greens?
SHORTEN:  We've said that we don't want to see any Commonwealth tax-payer money directly or indirectly go into it, we've seen the missed deadlines, we're sceptics
PRIME MINISTER:  No, it’s not.  No, it's their money
INTERVIEWER:  But there has been a reduction?
PRIME MINISTER:  What I’m saying, Leigh, is that all Australians who are living here are getting more jobs today than they were before
SHORTEN:  We want to try and get things done in the Parliament - that's why we're going to keep pushing for a national anti-corruption commission
INTERVIEWER:  Excellent. 
SHORTEN:  Complete strangers stranded at a remote desert motel during a raging storm soon find themselves the target of a deranged murderer
PRIME MINISTER:  We have no plans for subsidies at all, no, we don't have such a plan
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  No, no how many, how many murderers, rapists and paedophiles are we talking about?
SHORTEN:  That's an issue for a plebiscite.  
PRIME MINISTER:  No, this was just a shadow cabinet meeting. 
INTERVIEWER:  Manners maketh man. 
PRIME MINISTER:  It's going to require a reconstruction plan, property by property
SHORTEN:  Well we set up the National Disability Insurance Scheme when I was last in government
INTERVIEWER:  You don't know what you've got 'til it's. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well Neil, what I'm not going to do today - which is I think what you're inviting me to do -
SHORTEN:  Yeah, sure.  
INTERVIEWER:  Australia Day is Saturday, you’ve changed the rules so that local councils will be forced to hold citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day and you’re also bringing in a dress code for citizenship ceremonies
SHORTEN:  The Wishbone family is far from happy.  With a struggling bookshop, an overworked husband, and two misunderstood teenagers, Emma is at her wit's end trying to be the perfect mom
PRIME MINISTER:  I understand that and this will cost hundreds of millions of dollars if not more
INTERVIEWER:  [Inaudible] go, doesn’t it?
SHORTEN:  I'm confident, based on the economic reforms that we've engaged in in Opposition, that we will a very positive position on surplus over the four years, and a much better position than the Liberals over the 10 years, because we're winding back unsustainable tax subsidies at the top end, which in fact the Government want to keep
PRIME MINISTER:  So no, I wouldn't agree with your rather negative view of our performance
INTERVIEWER:  You might have to race Susie in the pool next time
SHORTEN:  No.  I've written to Mr Morrison - this is all pretty fast moving as you’d appreciate -  what I have written to Mr Morrison is a letter where I congratulate him, but I've also read media reports that they are rushing to appoint a new Governor-General, although the existing Governor-General's term doesn't finish until the end of March next year
PRIME MINISTER:  A good program should get support, but what we are able to do is fund Medicare to its highest rate of bulk-billing in history without it increasing people's taxes
INTERVIEWER:  Why So Serious?
PRIME MINISTER:  There have. 
SHORTEN:  No, that's right.  Someone's got to have the courage to stand up for the next generation, that's what we will do
INTERVIEWER:  I know we’re speaking to you because you’re the Prime Minister but I need to ask you a question this afternoon as Cronulla’s number one ticket holder
PRIME MINISTER:  With his wife's disappearance having become the focus of an intense media circus, a man sees the spotlight turned on him when it's suspected that he may not be innocent
SHORTEN:  Yes.  So I think the Government doesn't want to have an election, but on the other hand I think the people of  Australia are feeling quite left out of all the decisions that have been happening recently
INTERVIEWER:  Alright, Bill Shorten had his reply last night, among other things he's promising $2
PRIME MINISTER:  Well for the last six months, Ben, since I've taken over as Prime Minister, it's been my task really to get out to Australians all over the country and explain what we're doing as a Government, where we're going to take Australia after the next election if we're successful
SHORTEN:  Nothing at all, all I'm saying is that when we talk about fiscal management what happens in Australia is that it's not the politicians who drive for good fiscal outcomes in Australia it is the companies, it's the people who go to work
INTERVIEWER:  Do you deal with the dual citizenship issue that's caused so much havoc in the last 12 months as well?
SHORTEN:  And did you know since then - what is it? 5,420 marriages have occurred
PRIME MINISTER:  I think what they're going to do at the next election is decide who they want to continue to lead the country over the next three years
INTERVIEWER:  But that doesn't apply to the franking credit. 
SHORTEN:  Well, if they have a surplus we think this is a good thing but it's because there's increased taxation on companies
PRIME MINISTER:  I didn't support that at the time. 
INTERVIEWER:  You say you’d like to have more, so that means you don’t think you have enough
PRIME MINISTER:  So would you go to the barbeque?
SHORTEN:  An American pilot is sent to a Chinese province to teach a crew of would-be pilots how to fly war planes against the Japanese during World War II
INTERVIEWER:  But there is an argument that that would create a constitutional crisis and you’d be frightened of going to an election
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I accept that some of the unions would rather that we handled it in a different way –
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m looking forward to that. 
INTERVIEWER:  That’s the one in Cranbourne, not Flemington?
PRIME MINISTER:  Collin must make it through his final three days of probation for a chance at a new beginning
SHORTEN:  This all-female horror anthology features four dark tales from four fiercely talented women
INTERVIEWER:  Let the mystery unfold. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I just answered that question. 
SHORTEN:  It was a relief.  That was the point
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, despite Labor being well in front, Scott Morrison is selling a better story at the moment isn't he? He's miles in front of you personally on personal approval ratings
PRIME MINISTER:  When Tony Stark tries to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and Earth’s Mightiest Heroes are put to the ultimate test as the fate of the planet hangs in the balance
SHORTEN:  Baby Bink couldn't ask for more; he has adoring (if somewhat sickly-sweet) parents, he lives in a huge mansion, and he's just about to appear in the social pages of the paper
INTERVIEWER:  An entire universe.  Once and for all
PRIME MINISTER:  Well again Fran you’re seeing it as expenditure.  We don't see it as that, we see it as an investment in Australians to keep our economy growing
SHORTEN:  No, it was everyone.  It was a collective effort
INTERVIEWER:  Well Federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten joins us now
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah look you've got to be everywhere to talk to Australians these days and of all ages
SHORTEN:  Coal and our gas are important industries going forward
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, yeah that’s alright, yeah. 
SHORTEN:  Well, you'd have to say that we're on board somewhat reluctantly
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we’ve already had more than 1. 25 million jobs created since we were first elected and one of the reasons we’ve been able to do that is through these services
INTERVIEWER:  Can you give us a list of likely suspects?
SHORTEN:  Sorry about that Lisa. 
PRIME MINISTER:  The Queensland Government is working with us on that
INTERVIEWER:  But is this true, this is what we want  to see - 
PRIME MINISTER:  After his career is destroyed, a brilliant but arrogant surgeon gets a new lease on life when a sorcerer takes him under her wing and trains him to defend the world against evil
SHORTEN:  No, I haven’t quite got around to that. 
INTERVIEWER:  You’re kidding, hang on a moment, you're letting me down here
SHORTEN:  A look behind the scenes at Bernie Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme, how it was perpetrated on the public and the trail of destruction it left in its wake, both for the victims and Madoff's family
PRIME MINISTER:  Buddy is doing great, he has made a number of appearances
INTERVIEWER:  Is it true that you will go to the Governor-General tomorrow and ask that Parliament be dissolved and an election be called?
SHORTEN:  Graced with a velvet voice, 21-year-old Violet Sanford heads to New York to pursue her dream of becoming a songwriter only to find her aspirations sidelined by the accolades and notoriety she receives at her "day" job as a barmaid at Coyote Ugly
PRIME MINISTER:  That’ll be done by the Tasmanian Government, to the extent to which they’ll bring in other partners
INTERVIEWER:  I understand that, but just what changed your mind last night?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I'm not commenting on where it might come from other than to say the sophistication, as I said in the Parliament yesterday, has led agencies to advise that this is a state actor but I'm not
SHORTEN:  Arthur is a spirited ten-year old whose parents are away looking for work, whose eccentric grandfather has been missing for several years, and who lives with his grandmother in a country house that, in two days, will be repossessed, torn down, and turned into a block of flats unless Arthur's grandfather returns to sign some papers and pay off the family debt
INTERVIEWER:  It’d be hard to live on, wouldn’t they?
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m no expert.  We’ll put the tips in but I was there for the Swans game against Richmond, but they had I say seem to be coming good in that that second quarter and the third quarter, it unravelled a bit
SHORTEN:  Well good point.  I think back in 2004, the then Labor Party in Parliament felt a bit stampeded
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister Scott Morrison thank you so much for joining us on News Breakfast
PRIME MINISTER:  And I have. 
SHORTEN:  How does that help keep us safe and strong?
INTERVIEWER:  Don't underestimate the value of doing nothing. 
SHORTEN:  John Carter is a war-weary, former military captain who's inexplicably transported to the mysterious and exotic planet of Barsoom (Mars) and reluctantly becomes embroiled in an epic conflict
PRIME MINISTER:  Harry, Ron and Hermione continue their quest to vanquish the evil Voldemort once and for all
INTERVIEWER:  But given the economy -
SHORTEN:  The problem with what you're saying is that you assume that there's no cost to doing nothing, and there is
PRIME MINISTER:  Nothing will change under our Government because we know what we’re doing works
INTERVIEWER:  Good morning, good morning.  One of the biggest issues that we’re facing in north Queensland and actually most of the northern part of Australia is insurance
PRIME MINISTER:  That program has been running and we’re extending it as part of what I’m announcing today
SHORTEN:  Cinderella's Hot Night presents a lively retelling of the classic fairy tale
INTERVIEWER:  It’s one nil Prime Minister.   Top of the third spell vacuum, you both said V A C U U M
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no you will see current ones. 
SHORTEN:  My preference is questions from the audience, just direct
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, that's the big issue out there but can you legislate? Can you use the Parliament to ensure wages go up? 
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s not too bad?
SHORTEN:  High School student David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) has a talent for hacking
INTERVIEWER:  See, these budget surpluses, which look impressive in the years going forward, just terrific, they’re all dependant on maintaining a strong economy
SHORTEN:  That's Kevin's opinion.  What I'm going to do is -
PRIME MINISTER:  I think they should exercise caution and await further official advice
INTERVIEWER:  All right, we'll look forward to that.  Now, the energy Newstart policy, I happened to watch Q&A accidentally on Monday night and I saw that Arthur Sinodinos was tackled on why the $75 to $125 energy subsidy wasn't going to people in receipt of Newstart
PRIME MINISTER:  A number of issues.   I was in Gippsland yesterday, meeting with drought affected farmers, and they have raised a number of issues with me about support
SHORTEN:  A young soldier faces profound disillusionment in the soul-destroying horror of World War I
INTERVIEWER:  Good to talk to you this morning, Mr Shorten, thanks for making time for us
SHORTEN:  Lara Croft ventures to an underwater temple in search of the mythological Pandora's Box but, after securing it, it is promptly stolen by the villainous leader of a Chinese crime syndicate
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks, Deb. 
INTERVIEWER:  Would you - 
SHORTEN:  We've got the policies which are in the interests of working and middle Australia
PRIME MINISTER:  The NDIS is a massive social programme, it’s the biggest change since Medicare
INTERVIEWER:  That’s why we vote for governments, to do things. 
SHORTEN:  Rachel Keller must prevent evil Samara from taking possession of her son's soul
PRIME MINISTER:  Well you know I'll be taking that up with Border Force
INTERVIEWER:  Right, but –
PRIME MINISTER:  That's right.  As all cancer sufferers tell you when you talk to them, they also want to see more money going to research and treatment facilities
SHORTEN:  A woman turns to prescription medication as a way of handling her anxiety concerning her husband's upcoming release from prison
INTERVIEWER:  Who forced Barnaby Joyce to the High Court? Malcolm Turnbull?
SHORTEN:  Thank you very much. 
PRIME MINISTER: Well, we have been tracking through our agencies, this form of extremism
INTERVIEWER:  I appreciate that sentiment, I think talking about the past is important because the only way that you can move forward, reset at a moment like this, is if you acknowledge things that have happened in the past that are a problem and that need fixing
SHORTEN:  After a mysterious global crisis, a young girl is left alone to hide from a malevolent power that stalks her home
PRIME MINISTER:  (laugh) No, I think one is enough.  
INTERVIEWER:  But can you? That would mean renegotiating the whole thing?
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah. 
SHORTEN:  We are up for reviewing it and we want to review it positively
INTERVIEWER:  Let's go to some of the other issues that were on the radar this week
PRIME MINISTER:  When an IMF mission ends badly, the world is faced with dire consequences
SHORTEN:  But we got the right outcome.  That day, in front of the State Library was awesome
INTERVIEWER:  Scott Morrison joins me now.  Good morning
SHORTEN:  Slightly disturbed and painfully shy Angela Baker is sent away to summer camp with her cousin
PRIME MINISTER:  Obsessed with teaching his victims the value of life, a deranged, sadistic serial killer abducts the morally wayward
INTERVIEWER:  [Advertising read out]. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah it is I just got to get the breathing right and I’m getting it there, I’ve got up to about 600 metres a day so that’s, if I can do it all in one go it will be even better
SHORTEN:  Undercover Las Vegas police officer Vincent Downs is caught in a high stakes web of corrupt cops and the mob-controlled casino underground
INTERVIEWER:  23,000 migrants will be required to live in regional areas under this plan
SHORTEN:  It doesn't matter if it's a union who comes to me or a business, an environmental activist
PRIME MINISTER:  They are already doing that in terms of how they manage their burn management programs and that is part of the reverse auction process
INTERVIEWER:  But do you have enough women running in winnable seats?
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s what this stuff is about I mean, I mean I’m you know families are important, families should have meals together at night and not spend, you know, the evenings-
SHORTEN:  The story of a young man who arrives in Hollywood during the 1930s hoping to work in the film industry, falls in love, and finds himself swept up in the vibrant café society that defined the spirit of the age
INTERVIEWER:  Isn’t that itself racist? If you base immigration on race?
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s reasonable that Peter would have found that quite offensive –
SHORTEN:  See you. 
INTERVIEWER:  We’ll talk to you regularly throughout 2019, thanks for joining us from Cairns
SHORTEN:  Follows a young man named Albert and his horse, Joey, and how their bond is broken when Joey is sold to the cavalry and sent to the trenches of World War One
PRIME MINISTER:  What you yourselves said would be its allocated money and people are desperate for services and not getting them
INTERVIEWER:  And Kim Beazley argued, and Simon Crean who was the leader said, “We must do this because it’s fair
SHORTEN:  Well, far be it from me to judge the Turnbull legacy but I think that this is another opportunity that he missed
PRIME MINISTER:  This is true and they were our Australians of the Year, in fact
INTERVIEWER:  Ok, just finally -
SHORTEN:  Three detectives in the corrupt and brutal L. A
PRIME MINISTER:  And temporary protection visas. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  One of the messages that kept coming out in the last few days is that you’re looking to find a back door way to avoid the Phelps vote
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, the $5. 8 million that we’re spending up in Cooktown, that includes the reconciliation of the Rocks Precinct, the development of the Botanical Gardens, the upgrades to the Gamaay Dreaming Track and the Waymburr Story Project
SHORTEN:  Well, some people say that to me.  But with the division and the instability of the government, the fact that the Liberals sacked Malcolm Turnbull nine weeks ago, then they have got to send him to Bali to clean up the new Prime Minister's foreign policy mess, the chaos has got to end
INTERVIEWER:  And it, also, has been a key part of your ascendancy to a leadership position and ultimately being the Prime Minister, which is, I’m not suggesting for a moment that you would only do it for those reasons but the two fit well together
SHORTEN:  Rodney Copperbottom is a young robot inventor who dreams of making the world a better place, until the evil Ratchet takes over Big Weld Industries
PRIME MINISTER:  Whatever you like. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  And do you know what the money will be spent on?
SHORTEN:  I think we're competitive but we're not arrogant.  When I come to Western Australia I don't look at Liberal Western Australians and Labor Western Australians or you know, Independent Western Australians - I just see Western Australians
PRIME MINISTER:  Well no that's not quite what it said, to be honest
INTERVIEWER:  He made the mistake of speaking to his players when they were really facing personal crisis
SHORTEN:  No, not at all.  What’s happening now is that this government is raising record taxes and they spend it on property investors on their sixth house with negative gearing
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, that’s what they say. 
INTERVIEWER:  Can I just raise this with you - and I wrote to you about this - but you have said quite a few times since Friday, you've talked about a 10 year rescue plan
SHORTEN:  listen, you're the reason why the vote is going to go down
PRIME MINISTER:  There is a reason we're going into a surplus Budget next year is because of the hard work of Australians
INTERVIEWER:  Jack is back!
SHORTEN:  Well, we've been doing a lot of hard work in the last five years as a united and stable opposition
PRIME MINISTER:  A picture-perfect family is shattered when the work of a serial killer hits too close to home
INTERVIEWER:  The lead now you've got in the Newspoll is ten points, the result in the Wentworth by-election was diabolical for the Government, this result in Victoria it's yours to lose now isn't it, this election, a hundred per cent
SHORTEN:  We've already said that we would put money back into the Catholic and non-government system but Labor believes in education
PRIME MINISTER:  Tony Abbott was there and he said it didn’t happen
INTERVIEWER:  Welcome to the urban jungle. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks Paul. 
SHORTEN:  Twenty-eight-year-old Georgia is convinced the man of her dreams is "the one that got away" back in high school
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  But you’d agree it’s going to have to be one of those three? It can't just arrive at the edge of the city and go from 160 to 20
SHORTEN:  Based on a true story set in pre-war Japan, a man and one of his servants begin a torrid affair
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh no, we’re good, we’re good. 
INTERVIEWER:  I lost against Shorten. 
SHORTEN:  Well, there's two ingredients, aren't there? First of all, there's permanent migration
PRIME MINISTER:  I think it’s important for all of us – and today is Harmony Day
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten, on that third point, standing up for workers
SHORTEN:  I have only read what you read.  Mr Assange is entitled to his day in court
PRIME MINISTER:  Bill Shorten didn’t declare a donation to his own campaign for eight years
INTERVIEWER:  Totally agree. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, I was the shadow immigration minister at the time and I was very concerned about these issues and the way people were feeling in the community
SHORTEN:  Well first of all you know that we’ve offered Channel Nine the opportunity to do it through the Press Club
INTERVIEWER:  53,000 or 54,000. 
SHORTEN:  we won't be spending as a company director, money chasing votes when they need to go to repay the taxpayers and the workers what they are owed to begin with
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no, it was all shut down about October last year and so when they do that and decommission a facility like that, they have a procedure for actually standing it up again
INTERVIEWER:  Well you are using 328 million tonnes of Kyoto credits
PRIME MINISTER:  That is my Budget. 
SHORTEN:  I don't see how that's possible.  We'll have to see what the Government is thinking and they need to consult on the terms of reference
INTERVIEWER:  The Federal Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten is on his way to Gippsland for the memorial outside the Longford plant and he's with us now, good morning
SHORTEN:  A Muslim ambassador exiled from his homeland, Ahmad ibn Fadlan finds himself in the company of Vikings
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks guys, good to talk to talk to you. 
INTERVIEWER:  it says you want to impose a retiree tax.  It's pretty tough line to counter, isn't it?
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh okay –
SHORTEN:  The evil Dr.  Kochin uses the dragon balls to resurrect his mentor, Dr
INTERVIEWER:  Kevin Hart. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I said we’re going to make these decisions at the time nominations close and then we'll apply those decisions at that time as a Party organisation
SHORTEN:  White Castle hamburgers.  Both guys are at a crossroads, about to make major decisions that will affect the course of their lives
INTERVIEWER:  They’re incredibly moving, it’s astonishing that so many people now turn up all over Australia and all around the world
PRIME MINISTER:  he's yet to tell his family or friends he's gay and he doesn't know the identity of the anonymous classmate he's fallen for online
SHORTEN:  It's not a simple yes or no issue.  If we can take people in based upon our infrastructure, based upon the moving to the regions that's a plus
INTERVIEWER:  Which date in May? 
SHORTEN:  Benjamin, a young German computer whiz, is invited to join a subversive hacker group that wants to be noticed on the world's stage
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we'll wait for who is on the list of every candidate all around the country
INTERVIEWER:  The celebration of a lifetime. 
PRIME MINISTER:  The Labor Party's answer to every question.  Bill Shorten’s answer to every question is higher taxes
SHORTEN:  Well, I don’t accept that.  First of all, the idea that the environment and the economy are two separate planets and separate solar systems is rubbish
INTERVIEWER:  Life is like a box of chocolates. 
PRIME MINISTER:  There will be applications, I have no doubt about it, and the asylum groups are doing what they always do and that is seeking to undermine the Government's policies
SHORTEN:  In the year 10,191, the world is at war for control of the desert planet Dune – the only place where the time-travel substance 'Spice' can be found
[Music played]
INTERVIEWER:  It's a big change and it's a big risk.  Why should people trust you with that change?
PRIME MINISTER:  Good on you, thanks Shad, thanks Carly. 
SHORTEN:  Well I  think that successive governments over the decades have tried to tackle this issue of big cities being overcrowded
INTERVIEWER:  You're effectively saying Scott Morrison is a caretaker Prime Minister then if you do that
PRIME MINISTER:  Between personal obligations and training for his next big fight against an opponent with ties to his family's past, Adonis Creed is up against the challenge of his life
SHORTEN:  Fairness.  We think that Australia Day is about Australian values
INTERVIEWER:  You're campaigning in Western Sydney this morning, Bill Shorten, how worried are you about the prospects of the Labor Party not just in Western Sydney but in Sydney generally after the disastrous performance of state Labor in the recent NSW election?
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh, we’ll see. 
SHORTEN:  Valerie is in love with a brooding outsider, Peter, but her parents have arranged for her to marry another man – who is wealthy
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister in saying that, in the polls it shows  if an election was held now you’d be wiped out
PRIME MINISTER:  Correct. 
SHORTEN:  Ben Campbell is a young, highly intelligent, student at M
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, so he will be out there campaigning for you?
SHORTEN:  Thank you. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Thirty years after the events of the first film, a new blade runner, LAPD Officer K, unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos
INTERVIEWER:  Pump her up for code of conduct? In general terms don’t put a balaclava over your head when you’re in the same room as the Prime Minister but he has to do this as a thing
PRIME MINISTER:  What I’m saying today is we that we’ve got a very strong record of achievement
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I don't know where the Government thinks they get the money they spend from
INTERVIEWER:  Can you imagine if you answered that incorrectly? That would have been worldwide news today
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh, I’d probably pop in once or twice a month, maybe
SHORTEN:  There's a couple of big hypotheticals there aren't there, Lisa
INTERVIEWER:  Then you’ll go and see the Governor-General on Saturday or Sunday
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s not a traditional clobber, it should be a respectful ceremony
SHORTEN:  Yes, I am confident that we have got positive policies and we don't need to go down the negative divisive path
INTERVIEWER:  So the business case is two years off?
PRIME MINISTER:  No, it's a satellite city and it has been. 
SHORTEN:  Well, I think that there's been a lot of developments, hasn't there? This is not just Labor saying there's a cloud over the eligibility of a senior minister - it's now Malcolm Turnbull, it's now Julie Bishop
INTERVIEWER:  I loved the fact that the child who served you at McDonalds didn't know who you were
SHORTEN:  Well I've explained that I didn't understand the question that was being asked
PRIME MINISTER:  Cheers. 
INTERVIEWER:  What about my point about the size of net debt?
PRIME MINISTER:  No because what I'm announcing is an infrastructure project in the context of an entire population strategy Neil, this isn't just a one-off announcement
SHORTEN:  Well, I just hope that the treating medical advice gets taken seriously
INTERVIEWER:  They're back to raise a little terror. 
SHORTEN:  Corporate downsizing expert Ryan Bingham spends his life in planes, airports, and hotels, but just as he’s about to reach a milestone of ten million frequent flyer miles, he meets a woman who causes him to rethink his transient life
PRIME MINISTER:  Do you think it’s reasonable –
INTERVIEWER:  OK the capital of New Zealand, Prime Minister said it was Wellington
SHORTEN:  Cal Weaver is living the American dream.  He has a good job, a beautiful house, great children and a beautiful wife, named Emily
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t make anything of it. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Now, it's been a big week for the "why" question.  You've been asking the "why did you sack Malcolm Turnbull?" There is a why question for you, I think, given that you're so far ahead in the polls and yet Scott Morrison, in the latest Newspoll, leads you as preferred prime minister
PRIME MINISTER:  Absolutely.  At the last Budget, I said we were going to do the Melbourne Airport Rail Link and we have signed the heads of agreement with the state government there in Victoria to achieve just that
SHORTEN:  Well, sorry, no, it’s actually been shown that over time when you pay for less petrol, it actually costs less
INTERVIEWER:  But you can't guarantee you will put One Nation last
PRIME MINISTER:  Michael, this is our economic plan to ensure that our economy is built strong over the next decade and that Australians have the opportunities that they're seeking for themselves, because this is a Budget that is backing hardworking Australians
SHORTEN:  The hyperactive red-headed bird enters a turf war with a big city lawyer wanting to tear down his home in an effort to build a house to flip
INTERVIEWER:  You can get to that point in a second.  You have multiple journalists -
SHORTEN:  The war against the Bugs continues! A Federation Starship crash-lands on the distant Alien planet OM-1, stranding beloved leader Sky Marshal Anoke and several others, including comely but tough pilot Lola Beck
PRIME MINISTER:  Talking about policy. 
INTERVIEWER:  But if you have firms that have to be shifting and making the transition to having lower carbon emissions, that may mean that they have less money to spend on other forms of investment, it may mean they have lower profits so therefore they have less money to deliver in the form of company tax into government coffers
SHORTEN:  Oh, we don't know that yet.  We're working very hard on it
PRIME MINISTER:  No that’s not true.  That report was rubbish
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, thanks for your time this morning on this important one year anniversary of the "yes" result
SHORTEN:  If you're asking me to specify what a particular company in a particular factory will have to do, I can't do that, nor could you, nor can the Government
PRIME MINISTER:  Well can’t you see that what you’re suggesting –
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  No gut, no glory. 
PRIME MINISTER:  A story of encounters and partings interwoven between people; this is a human drama with feelings that touch one's heart gradually, which everyone has experienced at least once
SHORTEN: I'm not going to give the Government a blank cheque
INTERVIEWER:  Did they refuse to give an interview?
SHORTEN:  Well, maybe - but he hasn't moved to embassy either, so - 
PRIME MINISTER:  I’ve said we're going to make that decision at the time of the nominations closing
INTERVIEWER:  But it wasn't in the Budget. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I hope not. 
SHORTEN:  In terms of national security?
INTERVIEWER:  And you were hoping that that would result in an improvement for your side in the polls
PRIME MINISTER:  Harry, Ron and Hermione walk away from their last year at Hogwarts to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes, putting an end to Voldemort's bid for immortality
SHORTEN:  Oh Hamish, I think there is a little bit of excitement in your heart, you just need to find it
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah and then?
PRIME MINISTER:  To spice up a dinner party, old friends agree to share every private message that pops up on their phones -- with disastrous results
SHORTEN:  Yeah well, there is a way to go, things close up.  But what I'm going to do is focus on the people
INTERVIEWER:  Yep, absolutely. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well my secret in life is to always have assumed that I’m never the smartest person in the room
SHORTEN:  But we don't take this election for granted at all
INTERVIEWER:  If you want a job done well, hire a professional. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well because it will crash the economy.  It is not needed to have a higher target that will close industries and close jobs
SHORTEN:  Cheers, see you mate. 
INTERVIEWER:  Isn’t it a matter of priorities that you also then let people know as soon as possible where this money is coming from, because you are actually arguing for very big change in Australia and people have the right to have enough time to know where that money is coming from and where it is going to
SHORTEN:  Occasionally we do. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Can I just say one last thing Alan. 
INTERVIEWER:  I would never step on a Segway, it seems incredibly dangerous to me
PRIME MINISTER:  And you can just feel it.  I mean just talking to people at Sporties last night, talking to local tradies, talking to people in the building and civil construction industry
SHORTEN:  I don’t think any of us that extreme weather events are getting less frequent, are they?
[FEED DROPS OUT]
INTERVIEWER:  When I mentioned that about, you know, if it wasn't for population growth we'd be in recession
SHORTEN:  Spans the period from 1958 to the present day and tells the story of an unconditional love between a mother and her daughter which is endangered by an unsteady and manipulative father
PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
INTERVIEWER:  His time has come. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Harry starts his fourth year at Hogwarts, competes in the treacherous Triwizard Tournament and faces the evil Lord Voldemort
SHORTEN:  When this government, when the current Prime Minister was the loyal Treasurer, of the previous Prime Minister - if you believe that I've got a bridge to sell you - but anyway, when the Prime Minister was the Treasurer, when the current Treasurer was the former Environment Minister and when Malcolm Turnbull was still on top, they said the National Energy Guarantee would deliver $550 in lower household prices on energy
INTERVIEWER:  Daniel Andrews had a big spending agenda, do you recognise that there is a difference between state and federal sphere in that, do you have to have more fiscal responsibility in that sense and where is that in your list of priorities?
PRIME MINISTER:  Inside a snowflake exists the magical land of Whoville
SHORTEN:  Set between Episode II and III the Clone Wars is the first computer animated Star Wars film
INTERVIEWER:  Sorry to interrupt, but, and what's going on in the property market at the moment doesn't give you pause on that?
PRIME MINISTER:  Robert McCall, who serves an unflinching justice for the exploited and oppressed, embarks on a relentless, globe-trotting quest for vengeance when a long-time girl friend is murdered
SHORTEN:  Well, the Solicitor General's advice that they had, that broadly said that the better view that the Solicitor-General thought was that Mr Joyce was eligible, but they didn't give that categorical assurance and that's the same here
INTERVIEWER:  So there’s no joint urinal?
SHORTEN:  First of all, there's what happens before an election
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah that’s right.  It’s going to focus on elective surgery, it’s going to focus on mental health care, maternity services, breast cancer diagnoses
INTERVIEWER:  Your colleagues slammed South Australia for their batteries and renewable energies
PRIME MINISTER:  As Christmas approaches, Amelia Hughes, a career-focused Chicago app developer lacking in holiday spirit, returns to her small hometown of Christmas Creek to rediscover the meaning of Christmas
SHORTEN:  love. 
INTERVIEWER:  Just stop there for a minute, just stop there for one minute
PRIME MINISTER:  … and I think she's an extraordinary Australian.  An Australian of the Year and there  have been few people more than Ita that I think have lifted the standards of journalism in this country and I think that says a lot about her character and her abilities
SHORTEN:  Sure. 
INTERVIEWER:  Fantastic to have you on and thank you for your time
SHORTEN:  Listen, I don't want to get into a debate about the facts, but your last statement is 100 per cent wrong
PRIME MINISTER:  Because I don't think it helps Neil, for us to just get into this slanging match between all of the personalities here
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Spell vacuum. 
SHORTEN:  We will do that closer to the election but suffice to say we have done our maths and we are able to pay for the promises we are making
PRIME MINISTER:  Good morning Alan. 
INTERVIEWER:  And how many people were in this category?
PRIME MINISTER:  Exactly, $200 billion including the $5 billion on retirees
SHORTEN:  You can't sugar-coat this.  This is an Australian citizen who has been detained in China, the Embassy has just been notified
INTERVIEWER:  It is a measly figure, $277 a week.  Even Arthur Sinodinos, your colleague on Q&A on Monday was saying it needs to go up
PRIME MINISTER:  So I took the decision together with the Finance Minister and the Treasurer to extend that payment so it would simply pass the Parliament, as it did today without any fuss and without any trouble
SHORTEN:  It's so dishonest this debate.  It is so dishonest - 
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, speaking of footy, last time you and I spoke in person I gave you a Carlton football jumper and made you a member of the club
PRIME MINISTER:  We opposed the bill. 
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, I haven't commented on the polls for the last five years
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah it’s cattle stations
PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
SHORTEN:  Well there's two issues there.  One is the person and the other is the office
INTERVIEWER:  Absolutely.  That's understood
SHORTEN:  I like the principle, that's my answer.  I think the principle of it
PRIME MINISTER:  Agent Matt Graver teams up with operative Alejandro Gillick to prevent Mexican drug cartels from smuggling terrorists across the United States border
INTERVIEWER:  There’s one in every office. 
SHORTEN:  I think it would, be if they rush this, this will be an act of desperation, and what they want to do is try and assert decisions for which they don't have any responsibility after the next election if they are unsuccessful
PRIME MINISTER:  This is exactly as it is.  This is how I describe their policy
INTERVIEWER:  It’s really ugly, that’s what it is, yeah. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well there are Chinese companies that already do own parts of coal mining operations in New South Wales currently and otherwise those operations probably wouldn’t even be there, which is no good for those who work in those places
SHORTEN:  Thank you Jon. 
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, welcome
SHORTEN:  You've got to tell people where they fit in.  Change is not too hard but you do have to make sure that you don't leave people behind
PRIME MINISTER:  That will be in the Government's bill this morning when it's introduced into the House -
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  A New Power Is Rising. 
SHORTEN:  No, no.  Let's -
PRIME MINISTER:  That's it. 
INTERVIEWER:  These funds will only be available for people wanting to go into specific skills, it won’t be for all trades?
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I've got to say that I think we should have an Australian head of state but my family, my eight year old is driving me crazy to meet Meghan Markle - there's no question that the royals - that every little girl loves a princess
PRIME MINISTER:  I'm happy to call out people, as others have sought to call me out on things, I'm not shy about doing these sorts of things
INTERVIEWER:  Was it an afterthought?
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, just on this issue of grandfathering, you are quite right, when it comes to negative gearing all of the people currently negatively geared will not be affected and you’ll still be able to negatively gear your houses…
PRIME MINISTER:  That is all true.  And by contrast what do we say? We're saying that the instant asset write off goes from $25,000 to $30,000
INTERVIEWER:  There were reports about murderers, rapists and paedophiles
PRIME MINISTER:  Good morning Fran. 
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, you know that when the polls are good or bad, over five years, one month and 13 days, I haven't commented
INTERVIEWER:  Three of your ministers, as I mentioned earlier, have said that they won’t recontest the federal election
PRIME MINISTER:  Members of Parliament have meetings with people all the time, the suggestion here is that something inappropriate was done
SHORTEN:  6-year-old Susan Walker has doubts about childhood's most enduring miracle—Santa Claus
INTERVIEWER:  Substantially, I mean I know you can't commit but it needs a good hike
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes, I met with two sufferers, and they were in remission, on Monday
SHORTEN:  We will only ever give you facts - important facts
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Can I ask Mr Beers a question about the Adani project
SHORTEN:  Only one leader in this country has done a deal with Clive Palmer
PRIME MINISTER:  It doesn't excuse it. 
INTERVIEWER:  It is legit she can’t hear us in there.  Now I don’t if your people behind the scenes have explain the rules or I’ll go through it here
SHORTEN:  What our changes will mean is that it will be fairer, in terms of…
PRIME MINISTER:  One night per year, the government sanctions a 12-hour period in which citizens can commit any crime they wish -- including murder -- without fear of punishment or imprisonment
INTERVIEWER:  I understand that, but it’s priorities. 
SHORTEN:  After his wife dies, a blacksmith named Balian is thrust into royalty, political intrigue and bloody holy wars during the Crusades
PRIME MINISTER:  No that’s not right Jon. 
INTERVIEWER:  Good morning John, good morning Scott. 
PRIME MINISTER:  None at all. 
SHORTEN:  Well I don't know the answer to that, but I'm not sure that Mr Morrison does
INTERVIEWER:  I want to say nude?
SHORTEN:  Set on an island off the coast of New England in the summer of 1965, Moonrise Kingdom tells the story of two twelve-year-olds who fall in love, make a secret pact, and run away together into the wilderness
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, sure. 
INTERVIEWER:  So the reports then of other people in the shadow cabinet concluding that discussion by saying; “We have a non-discriminatory immigration policy and that's the way that it should stay”?
PRIME MINISTER:  A gritty crime saga which follows the lives of an elite unit of the LA County Sheriff’s Dept
SHORTEN:  Well, that's all happened under the current government and that's at the heart of this election
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Speaking of people going to war with Australians, you had said earlier in the week that you're not going to put any Australian life at risk to extract people from conflict zones?
SHORTEN:  A getaway driver for a bank robbery realizes he has been double crossed and races to find out who betrayed him
PRIME MINISTER:  Lake Tahoe, 1969.  Seven strangers, each one with a secret to bury, meet at El Royale, a decadent motel with a dark past
INTERVIEWER:  You have multiple reporters, reporting from multiple sources that it happened and you have one on the record saying the same
PRIME MINISTER:  The story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius
SHORTEN:  Lovely thank you very much for your interest. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  This is going to the point. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that was last year, Leigh, and what we’re focussed on is the plan we’re taking to the next election
SHORTEN:  We're going to change the laws and we're going to put the resources to enforce the laws
INTERVIEWER:  OK good.  I won't talk to you today about the infrastructure because that's part of where they will go to settle
SHORTEN:  I don't know if he is back from Bali yet, with the old mop, cleaning up Mr Morrison's problems
PRIME MINISTER:  And there was there was risk and you say it didn't exist because the bill didn't allow for it
INTERVIEWER:  It's not being dismissed. 
SHORTEN:  There couldn't have been anyone who was committing me to a preference deal
PRIME MINISTER:  For any Senator to say that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs were responsible for the terrorist attacks in Christchurch?
INTERVIEWER:  If I can get you to put your other hat on right now as Prime Minister, the former Prime Minister Tony Abbott told my colleague Ray Hadley today here on 2GB that “people would be better off voting Labor rather than an Independent”, he said, “because for all of Labor’s faults, at least they are a Party of government or potential government
PRIME MINISTER:  I have no idea, I have never discussed it with her
SHORTEN:  cement, steel, aluminium and other sectors.  We have created a $300 million dollar fund to help them invest in new technology
INTERVIEWER:  and it wasn’t enacted. 
SHORTEN:  Author P. L
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks, great to be here. 
INTERVIEWER:  Why would that need to be said though, if the discussion in the meeting was about; “How can we dampen down community concerns about Muslims”?
PRIME MINISTER:  During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew
SHORTEN:  I think there's a lot more water to go under the bridge but the real issue here in terms of Australians and why it matters to the everyday voter, is that you have the Minister for Home Affairs, a very important person, making very important decisions, there shouldn't be any Constitutional cloud over his eligibility to make those decisions, and I think that the Government needs to just clear the issue up
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  From J. K
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, the reason why we're doing it is there is no principle that says it is fair that a non-taxpayer gets a tax refund, a cash tax refund
PRIME MINISTER:  No, no hang on –
INTERVIEWER:  And just one related question on that, Adani, have you got a definitive position on that yet in terms of when you will back it or you won't?
SHORTEN:  
PRIME MINISTER:  [inaudible]
INTERVIEWER:  Let’s talk about what you might control if you are the Prime Minister by the end of the month, you've said that you'll deliver a 20 percent wage increase to childcare workers, that it's the only sector for which you'll do that because it's unique
SHORTEN:  Following a wild night out with his Best Man, Rob Anderson wakes up to find himself naked in an elevator on the morning of his wedding day and is forced to relive the morning over and over again

INTERVIEWER:  Should the Australian Government, any Australian Government, Coalition or Labor seek to stop such move?
SHORTEN:  No.  Let's go to one
PRIME MINISTER:  He didn't say now, I stress, he did not say it needed to go up now
INTERVIEWER:  And now Nauru has tightened it again. 
SHORTEN:  Yes, I thought the vote would be successful but what I realised on the morning of the vote being declared was the amount of pressure that a lot of people - LGBTQ people felt because what it was is this silly process which got the right outcome
PRIME MINISTER:  searching for clues about the mysterious and powerful organization known as WCKD
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  The Government's accusing Labor of being weak on national security again, because of some of your concerns about the encryption bill
SHORTEN:  Steve Ford is a private detective in Venice Beach, Calif
PRIME MINISTER:  Agreed.   
INTERVIEWER:  How often at Maccas?
SHORTEN:  Well under Scott Morrison, immigration has gone up, not down
PRIME MINISTER:  Sure this is, you know, this is crunch time. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  You’re listening to breakfast, its fourteen to eight, our guest is the Prime Minister
SHORTEN:  A former Secret Service agent grudgingly takes an assignment to protect a pop idol who's threatened by a crazed fan
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s the same answer to the question that was just put
INTERVIEWER:  The NDIS has been starved of funds and it hasn’t met –
PRIME MINISTER:  Well Jon, you can make up whatever mind you like about this but when it comes to border protection, I don’t think anyone can doubt my conviction, sincerity on this
SHORTEN:  No.  What we will do though is we're going to pick up what Malcolm Turnbull proposed
INTERVIEWER:  Scott Morrison?
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, it's publicly available, now if we're saying, the campaign against climate change by this government is malicious and stupid
PRIME MINISTER:  Because that is our economic record, Fran.  It's our economic record and the strength of the economy that matters to Australians going about their business today
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister why are you talking about preference deals? I'm not talking about a preference deal
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, it would only reinforce the need for the plan that we've announced today
SHORTEN:  Well, it is certainly easier said than done, but we have got to do it
INTERVIEWER:  A lot of retirees though, many of them who are on modest nest eggs are not millionaires, they’re worried about your changes to the franking credits
PRIME MINISTER:  Lara Jean's love life goes from imaginary to out of control when her secret letters to every boy she's ever fallen for are mysteriously mailed out
SHORTEN:  Well the Government sets great store on these matters
INTERVIEWER:  That that creates a prejudice. 
SHORTEN:  Well, I think that part of the reason why Clive Palmer is copping some criticism is that he used to run a nickel plant or business interest associated with it in Townsville
PRIME MINISTER:  Now that is true, as is gas, as is hydro. 
INTERVIEWER:  I was just checking my previous results against ah, I beat Turnbull
PRIME MINISTER:  When an unexpected enemy emerges and threatens global safety and security, Nick Fury, director of the international peacekeeping agency known as S
SHORTEN:  A deadly airborne virus finds its way into the USA and starts killing off people at an epidemic rate
INTERVIEWER:  Now, the man who wants the top job, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, is also in the Emerald City
PRIME MINISTER:  Well anything's possible but that doesn’t mean it happened
SHORTEN:  Yeah –
INTERVIEWER:  So Christmas Island yesterday, in WA today what do what are you up to? Are you on the election campaign trail already?
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m not quite sure what you’re referring to.  When I refer to the Labor Party, I talk about the fact that their emissions reduction targets are going to cost wage earners $9,000 each a year
SHORTEN:  Good morning Michael. 
INTERVIEWER:  A year?
SHORTEN:  The rebellious Thracian Spartacus, born and raised a slave, is sold to Gladiator trainer Batiatus
PRIME MINISTER:  Léon, the top hit man in New York, has earned a rep as an effective "cleaner"
INTERVIEWER:  This could be a benchmark here, let’s see how we go
SHORTEN:  Sorry, I didn't pluck that out of nowhere.  That was the Paris Agreement
PRIME MINISTER:  [Laughter] I'll leave that to others, but that's what I've been talking about from the day I became Prime Minister
INTERVIEWER:  No, no but let me ask you the question.  Because as you say –
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks David, good to be with you. 
SHORTEN:  The dynamic duo of Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon return for another crazy adventure
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  And you’ll go above politics on cancer if you feel you can do more, you will?
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s true at most places but not my house.  
SHORTEN:  Frank Drebin is persuaded out of retirement to go undercover in a state prison
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  They’ve got no money, no income. 
SHORTEN:  Set in the ghettos of Paris in 2010, an undercover cop and ex-thug try to infiltrate a gang in order to defuse a neutron bomb
PRIME MINISTER:  That starts right away. 
INTERVIEWER:  It would be good to clean up those multinationals who are using those loopholes, it would be a good thing
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's only relevant if in the cases that we're talking about, that’s what is known about the actual individuals who may be subject to transfers
SHORTEN:  Listen I'm not going to get - sorry, there's only one person who has ever been resurrected and I'm not going to compare Clive Palmer to him
INTERVIEWER:  Every primary school student will have access to swimming lessons under a major policy announcement being made today by Labor
SHORTEN:  Yes ours is a nine day tour, although because it overlapped with the weekend, I've had a day on the Sunshine Coast
PRIME MINISTER:  You can do that, but if we’re going to have a debate, we can have a debate or we can have an interview
INTERVIEWER:  That’s right, they assess the needs and seek urgent medical care, the mechanism is in place and there have been transfers from the Papua New Guinea or Nauru since July 2016
PRIME MINISTER:  The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mysteries of Peter Quill's true parentage
SHORTEN:  Being one of 101 takes its toll on Patch, who doesn't feel unique
INTERVIEWER:  The Royal Commission into Aged Care.  Now, I presume, based on what you have said in the past that you will support the idea?
PRIME MINISTER:  I know, but I also said that the Leader of the Opposition would be able give their reply
SHORTEN:  Well, this is the other good news - what it's going to mean is if you can store the energy during the day - say the family watching the show this morning, the kids go off to school, mum and dad might go to work - what happens is at the moment, if you have just got solar panels, you don't get the energy when you need it which is in the evenings, when the kids turn computers on and you need the energy
INTERVIEWER:  A fast trail to Geelong.  You've talked about $2 billion dollars towards it
PRIME MINISTER:  Sisters of the North; they have done an amazing job in raising funds for people up there and there's a bloke up there, Tim Pratt who runs a trucking company
SHORTEN:  Yes, she and Penny and myself, we think that the time has come to revisit that
INTERVIEWER:  How do you expect small businesses to cope with the costs that you're loading them up with, with these increases?
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m not planning to do that. 
SHORTEN:  We’re here to explain Labor’s great policies for this election
INTERVIEWER:  He could not have taken the free tickets in the first place
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, good luck with that. 
SHORTEN:  Well, there are positives in this agreement too, for our farmers, for our steel industry, for our higher education sector
INTERVIEWER:  But is $158 billion of promised tax cuts on top of $144 billion already legislated, this Budget tells us there are danger signs ahead for the economy
PRIME MINISTER:  They want to rebuild and they know it's not going to be easy
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all let's look at where the house prices have fallen
INTERVIEWER:  Scheme big. 
SHORTEN:  If he kills the king, Draco will die as well. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes, that's my view and that was my view.  It has always been my view
INTERVIEWER:  Kevin has 23 distinct personalities.  The 24th is about to be unleashed
SHORTEN:  Sarah, you know, it’s about time we buried the sausage scandal of 2016
PRIME MINISTER:  And they were wrong, they were wrong Waleed. 
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  No, that last… to the year to the…
PRIME MINISTER:  True. 
SHORTEN:  I will get Brendan to supplement the answer.  We are not going to pick a final number but I will state this
INTERVIEWER:  This house knows what makes you tick. 
SHORTEN:  The adventures of a heroic and debonair stalwart mouse named Stuart Little with human qualities, who faces some comic misadventures while searching for his lost bird friend and living with a human family as their child
PRIME MINISTER:  No, Jon, none of what you’ve just said is true at all
INTERVIEWER:  That’s contested…
PRIME MINISTER:  When the old-old-old-fashioned vampire Vlad arrives at the hotel for an impromptu family get-together, Hotel Transylvania is in for a collision of supernatural old-school and modern day cool
SHORTEN:  A wife questions her life choices as she travels to Stockholm with her husband, where he is slated to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature
INTERVIEWER:  Alright. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t have those figures to hand, Leigh.  What I do know is that population growth has not run as high as jobs growth
SHORTEN:  Because I've never forgotten the men I met there and their families, never forgotten them
INTERVIEWER:  Because we've talked so much over the years about fast trains, they've never, I don’t think we’ve ever had a train go faster than 100 kms an hour
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m very confident because that has been our form
SHORTEN:  No, that doesn't mean that people never talk to me but listen I think that what we've got to do is - the media plays an important role, people are entitled to their opinions
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Definitely.  And that's - when you're talking about the ABC at moment, I mean, they're in a bit of shambles
SHORTEN:  But it's interesting, when you get off a plane at Tullamarine or at Mascot when you come from overseas, whilst you've enjoyed your visit overseas you know there's things about this country we're proud of, but we don't - when we get back to Australia - when we're overseas do we talk about our Medicare system or our tax deductions?
PRIME MINISTER:  We stand by all of that because that was about the policy
INTERVIEWER:  You have meetings with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews today…
PRIME MINISTER:  He’s a pretty good fielder, he gets after those quick ones towards the boundary I think
SHORTEN:  I think Wentworth is a hard seat for Labor to win
INTERVIEWER:  But can you look down the camera here before you go and just say, as the Prime Minister of Australia, you want to tell all Australians there is no future other than a future in the dark if we don’t understand the importance of coal-fired power to the economic and personal well-being of Australians
SHORTEN:  The adventures of two California Highway Patrol motorcycle officers as they make their rounds on the freeways of Los Angeles
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t think you should vote for either of them.  That’s my view, that’s my very strong view
INTERVIEWER:  How do you get them to stay there?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, you tell me -
SHORTEN:  Grace, a compassionate young supervisor at a foster care facility, works with her boyfriend and colleague, Mason, to help at-risk teens
INTERVIEWER:  Well, you are promising to make life easier for Australians, but new treasury costings which the Government has released show you'll hit households with $387 billion in extra taxes over the next decade
PRIME MINISTER:  He's entitled to his view but I think what Australians need and our economy needs is a balanced and responsible migration plan
SHORTEN:  They still are.  They still are
INTERVIEWER:  Let's turn to the Adani coal mine in Queensland.  If there's a miner sitting in Rockhampton tonight watching and she wants to know, "Mr Shorten, do you reckon this mine will be a good thing for my industry and for Queensland?" What would you say to her?
SHORTEN:  Well you would love to know what business Tim is in, he obviously is having some business difficulties already, but let me just say this on climate change
PRIME MINISTER:  Cronulla is a long way from Aspley. 
INTERVIEWER:  How much are the batteries?
SHORTEN:  Seven strangers are taken out of their daily lives and placed mysteriously in a deadly cube where they all agree they must find their way out
PRIME MINISTER:  We have one and we have been achieving it is.  It is a right thing to do for future generations
INTERVIEWER:  Local council rate relief?
SHORTEN:  No, I'm not obsessed by the polls.  I've never thought that the election was a foregone conclusion
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I’m going to be busy all the way through mate, be busy all the way through
INTERVIEWER:  The Prime Minister. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well they’re completely different things.  I mean the Great Barrier Reef Foundation that's money to actually apply over that period of time Alan and it's being done through one organization, so that wasn’t just today, that was for many, many years to come
SHORTEN:  Well that's going to be a matter for the state and federal regulators isn't it
INTERVIEWER:  And we’ve got seats now, Liberal seats which the Labor Party, with what are projected to be swings, seats that they now have within their their gaze, which otherwise they thought were well beyond their reach so we will see more of you
SHORTEN:  We get into the adjectives game, what I can say is it is too low
PRIME MINISTER:  Like it's taboo, you’re not allowed to mention it?
INTERVIEWER:  How often do you go to Maccas?
PRIME MINISTER:  We will make those decisions –
SHORTEN:  Well he couldn't even bring it to the Parliament. 
INTERVIEWER:  What is the answer to that? Why is it now suddenly critically important?
PRIME MINISTER:  Let’s go through it. 
SHORTEN:  Any questions about this or other matters?
INTERVIEWER:  Thank you very much for your time.  
SHORTEN:  Well, I don't accept your assumption it's less enticing
PRIME MINISTER:  I remember the debates.  I remember when that boat crashed up on the jagged rocks of Christmas Island
INTERVIEWER:  Really?
PRIME MINISTER:  All the major DC superheroes are starring in their own films, all but the Teen Titans, so Robin is determined to remedy this situation by getting over his role as a sidekick and becoming a movie star
SHORTEN:  Do we spend too much or we won't spend enough? The reality is for me, it's not - I don't view education and health -
INTERVIEWER:  Well, those targets keep shifting around, apart from [inaudible]
PRIME MINISTER:  That's my form Waleed. 
SHORTEN:  I'm not choosing it, the scientists say it.  It's what we've got to do to stop the planet getting warmer
INTERVIEWER:  Let's come back to your Budget, let's come back to your tax package
SHORTEN: I do think that there's too much bullying goes on and by that, I don't necessarily know what has happened to her and I don't have the facts but I have seen some of the Government rush to say oh it's all made up or that's just life
PRIME MINISTER:  Cheers mate. 
INTERVIEWER:  Have you sought an explanation from Mr Dutton?
SHORTEN:  Yeah, and I said I'd come to that issue.  I said there are two issues
PRIME MINISTER:  Good morning Deb. 
INTERVIEWER:  The Christmas Island visit, was that a legitimate need for the Prime Minister to go there? No Prime Minister has been there before
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, let me talk about –
SHORTEN:  The Liberals are lying about tax.  I don't want to talk too much about it
INTERVIEWER:  I have no interest in sugar-coating any of it. 
PRIME MINISTER:  $144 billion is the legislated tax cuts that we currently have taken through the Parliament
SHORTEN:  Well we've had plenty of administrative heads of the Labor Party who haven't ended up in Parliament
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister Morrison's point is that Kerryn Phelps' Private Members Bill, if it's passed, will allow people smugglers to say to potential clients, "listen, Australia has changed the legislation, you won't have to stay on Nauru or Manus you just get some doctor to sign off in Australia and it's all good mate
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, it’s true. 
SHORTEN:  A group of students become trapped inside a mysterious cave where they discover time passes differently underground than on the surface
INTERVIEWER:  Budgets are always political documents but this is especially so with the election looming, do you think that this will be enough to win votes?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well Tanya Plibersek said this week that the Prime Minister has to explain to the Australian people how the facilities on Christmas Island are going to meet the need for what is now before us
SHORTEN:  See you guys.  Thank you
INTERVIEWER:  You said you'd cut red tape so that small business operators – this is at the bottom end of the market - could get $25,000 disaster relief payments
PRIME MINISTER:  his daughter's laptop. 
SHORTEN:  When CIA Analyst Jack Ryan interferes with an IRA assassination, a renegade faction targets Jack and his family as revenge
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  It was pretty good. 
SHORTEN:  I think the state election had a range of state issues, there is always a lesson there and we're not complacent
PRIME MINISTER:  Of course.  I mean, I didn't take the job on to, you know, to do anything else but that
INTERVIEWER:  Fearless lives forever. 
PRIME MINISTER:  They’re criminals.  That’s what criminals do, they lie
SHORTEN:  Good morning. 
INTERVIEWER:  But every time you reference them, every time you make them more relevant
SHORTEN:  Look forward to talking. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I'm not going to give you a running commentary. 
INTERVIEWER:  Talking about people who go and sign up with Islamic State, you've also made some comments in relation to the children of Khaled Sharrouf, one of our most infamous terrorists
PRIME MINISTER:  McCall believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and dedicated himself to beginning a new, quiet life
SHORTEN:  Six short stories that explore the extremities of human behavior involving people in distress
INTERVIEWER:  We may have an overinflated sense of our self-importance
SHORTEN:  Oh no.  Listen, you and I know that, and more importantly Australians know, this is a Government who is going to run on fear and negativity
PRIME MINISTER:  I am going to wait to see what all the nominations are and in our Party those decisions are made by the Party organisation
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  The Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well since I became Prime Minister, we’ve has I think now 19 women selected in key roles
SHORTEN:  When the evil wizard Gargamel chases the tiny blue Smurfs out of their village, they tumble from their magical world and into ours -- in fact, smack dab in the middle of Central Park
INTERVIEWER:  Okay can you give me that number, I am actually interested to know it
PRIME MINISTER:  Believing they have left behind shadowy figures from their past, newlyweds Christian and Ana fully embrace an inextricable connection and shared life of luxury
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, we think that the Commonwealth and the politicians should have an anti-corruption commission
[FEED DROPS OUT]
INTERVIEWER:  Sorry which one is that? The one to the airport or the one to Geelong?
SHORTEN:  there is still a man inside the machine. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Ray Breslin manages an elite team of security specialists trained in the art of breaking people out of the world's most impenetrable prisons
INTERVIEWER:  The New Zealand PM on the phone.  You what? You said what?
SHORTEN:  Well, the fact of the matter is we are arguing for a change in Australia
PRIME MINISTER:  I mean last year when we did the Budget - I think I remember talking about spinal muscular atrophy and how that's changing the lives of young Australians and their parents - the letters I've had, the stories I've heard, I mean Greg Hunt has the best job in the world I think as the Health Minister to be able to make these changes
INTERVIEWER:  How many times have you spoken to Malcolm Turnbull since he ceased being Prime Minister?
PRIME MINISTER:  In North Queensland, what we’re looking to do is establish what is the most viable approach
SHORTEN:  I'll certainly be watching Four Corners and I thought one of your panellist's comments that maybe the Government was anticipating a pretty tough story, I'll be watching that
INTERVIEWER:  But why didn't you agree to it? The National Energy Guarantee framework was all there
PRIME MINISTER:  Good morning Michael. 
SHORTEN:  No, he supports party policy and that is our party policy, a two-state solution - the right of Israel to exist behind secure borders but also recognising the legitimate aspirations of Palestinian people to their own country
INTERVIEWER:  No all of them either way.  Does the Labor Party run dead in Wentworth or do you run a serious campaign?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it's with Mark McGowan.  They're the ones doing the assessment
SHORTEN:  they want to look after the top end of town by cutting services to everyone
INTERVIEWER:  Just about out of time so confirming there will be no change at all if you win government to the negative gearing plan? 
SHORTEN:  A young man goes to his father's home in Maine where, helped by a public registry, he locates and tracks down sex offenders
PRIME MINISTER:  Has always been consistent -
INTERVIEWER:  Now again, Bill Shorten is saying that all these roads, new roads, new houses, new office developments, will have to have charging facilities
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah. 
SHORTEN:  Let's go through each of those points rather than rapid fire, let's have a conversation
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah but I mean, you've got 500,000 international students, 500,000 international students
SHORTEN:  It mightn't be enough, I get that so - 
PRIME MINISTER:  Let me explain what happens with the NDIS.  What happens is based on estimates that are provided by the states working with the Commonwealth to understand what the expected demand is, then you pay out what the services are that are provided in response to that demand
INTERVIEWER:  If you become the Prime Minister, will the CFMEU be allowed to enforce closed shops on construction sites, no ticket no work?
PRIME MINISTER:  Wellington. 
SHORTEN:  That will be up to the Australian people, Georgie but if I am, I won't let you or the Australian people down
INTERVIEWER:  Well if the Labor Party - and this very political, I know he’s pretending it’s not –
PRIME MINISTER:  I just focus on the plan we have, the plans that we have outlaid on the economy, our national security plans, the plans I’m announcing today to meet our climate change targets and that’s what we are putting to the Australian people
SHORTEN:  I think there are some things that we can do -
INTERVIEWER:  Do you have a rough figure at least on how much it would cost?
PRIME MINISTER:  If I didn’t know it would be a problem. 
SHORTEN:  They are not correct.  There you go, short answer too
INTERVIEWER:  When will we be in it, when will it be running?
SHORTEN:  A young violinist unravels her long lost father's past, triggering dark forces that reach beyond her imagination
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s not actually true…
INTERVIEWER:  Alright, and Sunday? Should I put a mark around Sunday and expect to be on air announcing an election?
SHORTEN:  On the run in the year 1987, Bumblebee finds refuge in a junkyard in a small Californian beach town
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, that has always been my view. 
INTERVIEWER:  But I was reading this morning on the train that your lovely Deputy, Tanya Plibersek, actually is putting through a Senate Bill to actually try and remove the discrimination for the religious schools
SHORTEN:  Well I don't hold the children responsible for the mistakes of their parents
PRIME MINISTER:  Harry Potter has lived under the stairs at his aunt and uncle's house his whole life
INTERVIEWER:  He says, ‘hang on’…
PRIME MINISTER:  No, we’ve never actually found ourselves in that situation to the best of my recollection
SHORTEN:  Well good point.  We are keeping an eye on this
INTERVIEWER:  You've got a big program, why wouldn't you want to debate everyone and everywhere
PRIME MINISTER:  Well as you can see, Entschy has nailed that for a long time
SHORTEN:  A tormented jazz musician finds himself lost in an enigmatic story involving murder, surveillance, gangsters, doppelgangers, and an impossible transformation inside a prison cell
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Witness the beginning of a happy ending. 
SHORTEN:  An extraordinarily intelligent young girl from a cruel and uncaring family discovers she possesses telekinetic powers and is sent off to a school headed by a tyrannical principal
PRIME MINISTER:  I rule them out. 
INTERVIEWER:  I will just confirm, you already have, sorry - it was last week, before this rubbish was passed – a Transitory Persons Committee don't you? I think within the Department of Home Affairs and they meet once a month?
SHORTEN:  Well, we have a look around the world and the Americans have been able to make some big breakthroughs in some financial scandals by basically encouraging some of the people involved to be able to come forward and get a reward
PRIME MINISTER:  They were appalling comments on the contribution of Asian immigrants to Australia
INTERVIEWER:  Address those concerns?
SHORTEN: Great to be on the show. 
PRIME MINISTER:  We have and that BAE economic study that you’re familiar with, which I know you you’ve spoken to, their estimated cost of what Bill Shorten is talking about with his reckless carbon tax, carbon target - call it whatever you like, all I know is it’s going to increase the price of everything - that is going to cost the economy around half a trillion dollars
INTERVIEWER:  A riches to rags story.  If only he could remember it
SHORTEN:  No, no, hang on, Leigh.  You keep characterising my policies -
PRIME MINISTER:  As Harry begins his sixth year at Hogwarts, he discovers an old book marked as 'Property of the Half-Blood Prince', and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Well clearly you've got suspicions. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I'll send a videogram. 
SHORTEN:  We're certainly more progressive than the current government in Canberra
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, but it is a problem. 
SHORTEN:  We're not going back to the policies of the past.  We're not going to have a carbon tax
PRIME MINISTER:  You’re right we will have a Budget, we’ll hand down a Budget on the 2nd of April
INTERVIEWER:  “We're drawing a line under this because we have a non-discriminatory immigration system
PRIME MINISTER:  Well there's no doubt we're going to prosecute it
SHORTEN:  A newly married couple who, in the process of starting a family, learn many of life's important lessons from their trouble-loving retriever, Marley
INTERVIEWER:  From the smallest beginnings come the greatest legends
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh you make the time, it’s a good head space and it’s also, you know, good exercise and you know you’ve got to do that in these sorts of jobs and I’m enjoying it
SHORTEN:  No, I’m happy if you do.  What car you choose to drive is your business
INTERVIEWER:  I was recently wandering around the seat of Kooyong
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, it's a lie and it's a stupid lie.  Look, there's a reason why Labor clearly haven't been able to deliver a surplus since I had long curly hair and I understand Josh had a mullet
SHORTEN:  The setting is Detroit in 1995.  The city is divided by 8 Mile, a road that splits the town in half along racial lines
INTERVIEWER:  Your mind is the scene of the crime. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I think they are highly dubious.  Bill Shorten’s answer to every question is, ‘I’ll just tax you more
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, we don't accept that.  This is the Government who's raised more taxes than anyone before us
INTERVIEWER:  It’s been undersold, underprepared, underrun…
PRIME MINISTER:  Well again Tom, that's for the Australian people to determine, I'm not complacent about this
SHORTEN:  There comes a point in everyone’s life when you have to make a decision about the direction you’re going to take
INTERVIEWER:  Can I take you to page one - and I know this is a sensitive matter, I know that, but let’s go to page one of the Australian
PRIME MINISTER:  the 'synthetic', David, survivor of the doomed Prometheus expedition
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, the Government a few weeks ago said that they wanted to look at how we can break through the encrypted telecommunications of people who are criminals, terrorists and the like
INTERVIEWER:  With photoshopped shoes or real shoes?
PRIME MINISTER:  Thank you. 
SHORTEN:  It's always possible to get airtime if you're willing to say silly things but if you want to have a strong, sensible, centrist debate and this is what Mr Turnbull perhaps missed the opportunity to do, he came in with a lot of good will, is you have to lead but you can lead from the centre
INTERVIEWER:  Thanks for coming in. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes absolutely, because this is the stark choice; I mean when your economy is facing stiff headwinds that we are – yesterday unemployment came down to the lowest level in seven years, 4
SHORTEN:  No, I'm just saying that he can make decisions which affect them now, but appointing -  this is the Head of State of Australia
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten, we'll have to leave it there.  Thanks for this debate
SHORTEN:  No.  No
PRIME MINISTER:  Harry, Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts for another magic-filled year
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah and as I mentioned earlier, clearly everyone's recognised you know, that the next election is going to be, if not largely on wage growth, and probably all about it, and who can claim that they can increase it will be the winner
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes. 
SHORTEN:  Every other level of government has an anti-corruption commission, other states have
INTERVIEWER:  How big of a problem is it?
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes. 
SHORTEN:  Yeah lovely to talk.  And it's going to be great to see some people even though it's marking a tragic event
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Well what about another case, a former Minister and a Minister Michael Keenan and Michaelia Cash refusing to cooperate with the police investigation
PRIME MINISTER:  Not yet, looking forward to it. 
SHORTEN:  The infamous story of Benjamin Barker, a. k
INTERVIEWER:  Does acting in accordance with those beliefs mean that you will be henceforth – this is about the future and about the tone you want to set as a leader - that you will be preferencing One Nation last?
PRIME MINISTER:  I'm simply saying Waleed that what Peter was explaining were some lessons that were learned during a period of what was a fairly tumultuous time in the world –
SHORTEN:  As you'd be aware, Labor's been working hard from Opposition to identify how we can improve the bottom line of the Budget
INTERVIEWER:  So you like the idea of Geelong being like a suburb of Melbourne?
SHORTEN:  Yes it's good.  It's really good
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's… the non-mining investment was actually up, mining investment was down
INTERVIEWER:  Scott Morrison, welcome to ABC Far North Queensland
SHORTEN:  The true story of Marine Corporal Megan Leavey, who forms a powerful bond with an aggressive combat dog, Rex
PRIME MINISTER:  Well this is the business case that is now going to be developed
INTERVIEWER:  A Fairy Tale for Troubled Times. 
PRIME MINISTER:  The true story of how businessman Oskar Schindler saved over a thousand Jewish lives from the Nazis while they worked as slaves in his factory during World War II
SHORTEN:  Up to $2000, yeah. 
INTERVIEWER:  Absolutely, rorts and rip-offs, many of them. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Under the direction of a ruthless instructor, a talented young drummer begins to pursue perfection at any cost, even his humanity
SHORTEN:  No.  And let's just be clear on that
INTERVIEWER:  Thank you for your time this morning. 
SHORTEN:  Well all of the research we've seen and the evidence - between 60 and 90 per cent, I mean you heard that right
PRIME MINISTER:  Well 150 beds at Cairns hospital for a start.  You know that means you won’t have to go south to get treatment and this is important
INTERVIEWER:  Keep America great. 
SHORTEN:  Perhaps if you bear with me for a moment, I'll answer your question
PRIME MINISTER:  Jon I’m sorry, I've got to stop you there because you cannot tell those lies to the Australian people
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Back to work. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Very trendy to talk down James Cook and all that sort of stuff
SHORTEN:  Yeah, I was with the Australian Workers Union, I was the Victorian Secretary and I was involved in trying to protect the workforce from the unfair blame of the company and trying to make sense of what had happened
INTERVIEWER:  I'm not asking you to say. 
SHORTEN:  Politicians out, independent transparent process in
PRIME MINISTER:  I’m sorry Jon, you’ve got this absolutely wrong. 
INTERVIEWER:  How much will it give to someone on the minimum wage?
SHORTEN:  Dusty is a cropdusting plane who dreams of competing in a famous aerial race
PRIME MINISTER:  They decide not to live, that seems to them the right option for you
INTERVIEWER:  And how good is that deal? What’s the rate?
SHORTEN:  It was just madness.  My view is that people's relationships are their own business
PRIME MINISTER:  Thrust into an all-new adventure, a down-on-his-luck Capt
INTERVIEWER:  So do you borrow the credibility that was built by the Andrews government and their model that led to them being re-elected? Do you say, well, we haven't really done that much for infrastructure in Victoria for the last few years, but forgive us, we've realised that the error of our ways and we're going to do it now?
PRIME MINISTER:  I know, and that’s what this support does.  It provides concessional loans for businesses to get through, it provides that additional support
SHORTEN:  A long-lost music producer finds a singer-songwriter right about the moment he has given up all hope on life
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister, thank you very much. 
PRIME MINISTER:  In the electorate of Longman – no, well you’ve raised the issue –
SHORTEN:  Look forward to it, cheerio. 
INTERVIEWER:  She’s one of your constituents.  Is Aspley one of your seats? I don’t know what that would be um, I don’t think is
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, the only way that you could follow the government’s logic is if you would stop investing in property in Australia
PRIME MINISTER:  I know that's what the Labor Party wants you to ask me Michael –
INTERVIEWER:  He’s doing a wonderful job and the other thing I’d love you to do up there if you get half an hour, go to the museum
PRIME MINISTER:  Tax cuts, that’s what.  We’ve already legislated our first tranche last year and we’ve taken more tax cuts for this year
SHORTEN:  Our climate change plans will grow the economy, they'll create jobs and they'll lower power prices
INTERVIEWER:  That’s hard to believe. 
SHORTEN:  A Victorian surgeon rescues a heavily disfigured man being mistreated by his "owner" as a side-show freak
PRIME MINISTER:  Well actually, we’re down on the last one Fran. 
INTERVIEWER:  We have had that on your side, of course, but from my perspective, it is interesting this morning, looking at a whole suite of things going on in the country, growth at what 3
SHORTEN:  You can't have it all ways, you can't say when will you tell people 
PRIME MINISTER:  They do not Waleed.  I’m sorry, I’m the Prime Minister, I’m responsible for implementing it and I have the full availability of the Attorney General, the Attorney General’s Department, the Department of Home Affairs and their advice to me is, no, we don't have that power
INTERVIEWER:  Can I just get a general comment, yeah, what do you think of today’s announcement, how will that help you in the skills shortage you face?
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s it. 
SHORTEN:  They have invented iView You know it is possible to do an interview at one point in the day - 
INTERVIEWER:  You've also promised $600,000 towards building new digital studios for this radio station
PRIME MINISTER:  Every single service that's provided and sought -
SHORTEN:  Leigh, you know there's no plans for 60 per cent or indeed 50 per cent, but I agree that what we need to do is eventually lighten the burden of income tax across all the levels
INTERVIEWER:  The tax cuts you’ve announced equate to about $19 a week extra for the average Australian income
SHORTEN:  Jack Ryan, as a young covert CIA analyst, uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U
PRIME MINISTER:  That it goes to businesses up to $50 million, that we’re going to spend over half a billion dollars training among that new apprentices, 80,000 new apprentices
INTERVIEWER:  And just to explain what happened there, one of our cameramen had a bit of an episode
PRIME MINISTER:  That is very important.  It's really adding value and because migration does, migrants have added value, of course, to our country
SHORTEN:  First of all on the pledge, no I am not going to sign it
INTERVIEWER:  That’s Coles and Woolworths, that’s not farm gate prices
SHORTEN:  Well what we can do is we can make sure that if we are going to provide some support for the wages of early childhood educators, again we will say to the operators if Labor is providing some modest improvement in the wages of childhood educators, if Labor is providing a couple of thousand dollars a year for parents, what we say to the childcare operators is you don't get to pocket that
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes. 
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister –
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it doesn’t need to be restored because it hasn’t been cut, it’s funding is not going backwards it’s actually being maintained
SHORTEN:  Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda are dead.  Now, upon the news of Detective Kerry's murder, two seasoned FBI profilers, Agent Strahm and Agent Perez, arrive in the terrified community to assist the veteran Detective Hoffman in sifting through Jigsaw's latest grisly remains and piecing together the puzzle
INTERVIEWER:  Clive Palmer has been copping some criticism for sending out mass text messages
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah they were down there, it was great.  Shoalhaven Heads is a top spot, it’s sort of people from all walks of life and we had a great time down there and they had a big, the fishing club, had a huge fundraising afternoon so the family and I and friends went down and enjoyed that and they raised a bit of money for the local rural fire service and the surf club and so on
SHORTEN:  That's right. 
INTERVIEWER:  What is 176 minus 86?
PRIME MINISTER:  Okay and well done to the Taipans last night, cheers
SHORTEN:  That's our aim and the point about it, but just to come to that, we do need to see what numbers the Government have got
INTERVIEWER:  [Inaudible]. 
PRIME MINISTER:  All of what you've said is untrue.  Let me explain why
SHORTEN:  Hang on a second.  As you would know as a seasoned journalist, there is always plenty of conversations
INTERVIEWER:  Real heroes.  Not actual size
PRIME MINISTER:  No, they abolished taxes at the same time, Leigh.  They actually lessened the overall individual tax burden on Australians
SHORTEN:  In danger of losing his business, Anthony Roca, an ordinary man, develops a scam that will become the heist of the century
INTERVIEWER:  Have you decided? 
SHORTEN:  Well, first of all, we've always made clear that whatever outcome occurs should be after consultation and negotiation with business including small business
PRIME MINISTER:  They’ll be working closely with us to identify those, thanks very much, thanks for being here
INTERVIEWER:  The cap on, good on you.  Good on you
SHORTEN:  No.  Let's go to that
PRIME MINISTER:  Clear at the time of the nominations closing, Waleed
INTERVIEWER:  Outrageous.  
SHORTEN:  Found inside a shining stalk of bamboo by an old bamboo cutter and his wife, a tiny girl grows rapidly into an exquisite young lady
PRIME MINISTER:  You must have missed the bit that showed the difference between Bill Shorten and I when it comes to the economy and national security, we are resonating when it comes to our economic message and our national security message
INTERVIEWER:  Please tell everybody.  By the way, do you keep your finger on the pulse of tourism? I mean, you were involved up to your neck for years?
SHORTEN:  In this animated retelling of the story from the Bible's Book of Genesis, Joseph's gift of dream interpretation and his brilliantly colored coat inspires jealousy in his brothers
PRIME MINISTER:  Joe works for DFAT.  And so I am sure the Secretary will deal with whatever, if any, matters there are to be dealt with as she made clear to estimates last week
INTERVIEWER:  Well no this is a government decision I’m talking about, underwriting the government, taxpayer’s money
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, those things are mutually exclusive, Jon.  I mean, we are allowed to have reliable energy

PRIME MINISTER:  We’ve got a series, there's Terralgon, there’s Gold Coast, there’s Wollongong and there are already projects underway that we've done, into Newcastle and out of Ballarat and a range of other projects
INTERVIEWER:  Have our intelligence agencies actually heard any chatter though, because it’s being reported by David Speers, that he’s been told that Australia’s intelligence agencies believe that “the beast is stirring,” since the passage of the medevac bill? They’re trying to ensure that the beast doesn’t wake up, the beast of course being the people smuggling trade
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I certainly don't agree with her on that, that's for sure
SHORTEN:  A college-age brother and sister get more than they bargained for on their road trip home from spring break
INTERVIEWER:  I'm not talking about deal with One Nation.  I'm talking about a decision from your Party to preference One Nation - who by the way said that Islam was a disease that needed to be vaccinated - will you be putting them last on your how-to-vote card?
SHORTEN:  Actually, first things first - I am not going to spend my time bagging the current Prime Minister
PRIME MINISTER:  King T'Challa returns home from America to the reclusive, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to serve as his country's new leader
INTERVIEWER:  … we also have a view of assessing politicians and what they offer and we always see it through the prism of what’s going to get them re-elected
PRIME MINISTER:  Well we have record bulk-billing rates right across the country
SHORTEN:  There are a number of points in what you say.  First of all, enterprise bargaining was introduced 25 years ago

SHORTEN:  Oh yes. 
INTERVIEWER:  So you’re saying it’s a big transfer of wealth from people’s pockets into government’s pocket
PRIME MINISTER:  Fearing the actions of a god-like Super Hero left unchecked, Gotham City’s own formidable, forceful vigilante takes on Metropolis’s most revered, modern-day savior, while the world wrestles with what sort of hero it really needs
SHORTEN:  Well we’ll release our figures before the election is concluded, but we’ve also made clear that we think we need to wind back what we give to negative gearing
INTERVIEWER:  In relation to the pledge, I'm not sure how many people have actually read the pledge
SHORTEN:  The story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman and her family
PRIME MINISTER:  Rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker, who is unsettled by the strength of her powers
INTERVIEWER:  The world has enough Superheroes. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No I don't think – increasingly - that people do think that it’s clear
SHORTEN:  When a car bomb explodes on the American side of the U
INTERVIEWER:  Well if you’re not re-elected do you want to be opposition leader?
PRIME MINISTER:  True, yep.  
SHORTEN:  Charlie Kenton is a washed-up fighter who retired from the ring when robots took over the sport
INTERVIEWER:  But you’re press conference the other day with lots of people in fluoro vests and hard hats - and we're going to see more of that - you said it can start in 18 months, but in fact, the cash flow doesn't kick in until 2021?
PRIME MINISTER:  No they’re not contested, they're the hard facts of what has occurred since we were elected until now
SHORTEN:  Mind you, I didn't think they'd roll Malcolm, so what would I know
INTERVIEWER:  It’s a cliché for journalists to ask Prime Ministers about Newspoll, and the latest Newspoll’s come out this morning, so I won’t ask you about the figures which show nothing’s changed, but border protection has been a lively issue during the last two weeks, and the figures haven’t budged
SHORTEN:  We're going to stick to our existing policies.  It's just not fair for our younger generation to not be able to afford their first home when the Government of the day is giving a tax subsidy to property investors to buy their fifth or sixth
PRIME MINISTER:  Well for reasons that would suggest that they weren't welcome in the United States because they'd be concerned about who they were
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  I don't want to take any air out of your tires but can I tell you that the switchboard and emails have been on fire here, not about the Budget, but about Mr Shorten's energy policy
SHORTEN:  The incredible true story behind the most controversial Italian court cases in recent years
PRIME MINISTER:  Why?
INTERVIEWER:  So that's a promise not to spam our phones during the election is it, Mr Shorten? No messages from Bill?
SHORTEN:  Well, I was in Whyalla today, talking to the people who run OneSteel and they made it clear that they're investing in more renewable energy
PRIME MINISTER:  I was a little bit out of there I’ve got to say but mate, it’s good to be back here with you
INTERVIEWER:  I'm talking almost 70 bucks a week, you take out of them now
SHORTEN:  No.  What we're going to do is prioritise, and I'll give you the key features of what we're doing
PRIME MINISTER:  Well this is the point Waleed, I don't know who is going to nominate
INTERVIEWER:  A political leak. 
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Waleed. 
SHORTEN:  Well come along to Box Hill today where we’re going to talk more about how we are going to look after early childhood educators
INTERVIEWER:  Speaking of Julie Bishop, she’s talked about potentially re-contesting as well
SHORTEN:  Listen, I think what happened is that people just want you to get on with the job
PRIME MINISTER:  Yep. 
INTERVIEWER:  Can we just take this negative gearing thing, just very very simple
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, look they’re decisions that’ll be made by investors and suppliers, and energy companies and others in terms of how they’re meeting supply to the market
SHORTEN:  No.  You know I did the shopping today in Moonee Ponds where I live and people were saying bring on the Federal Election, and some people would say that Labor has it in the bag, Idon't think that at all
INTERVIEWER:  You’ve acted as Immigration Minister, you know more about stopping boats than anyone else in Australia; will people smugglers re-start their trade because of this bill?
PRIME MINISTER:  I just go the normal quarter-pounder meal or something like that
SHORTEN:  We think that there's something that we can work with there, yes
INTERVIEWER:  Every now and again there's one that goes past and you go; “Ooh, that would be interesting”
SHORTEN:  Who, Rupert Murdoch or Kevin Rudd?
PRIME MINISTER:  No. 
INTERVIEWER:  We’ll come back on Christmas Island, but I just I just want to focus on Perth for the moment
SHORTEN:  No listen, I've been very lucky with my team in the last five years
PRIME MINISTER:  Better than very slow trains, Tom. 
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten joins me now.  Bill, good morning to you
SHORTEN:  While hiding from bullies in his school's attic, a young boy discovers the extraordinary land of Fantasia, through a magical book called The Neverending Story
PRIME MINISTER:  No I think that's a bit unfair to put it in those terms
INTERVIEWER:  V A C double U M. 
SHORTEN:  I've tried to ring her to find out what she meant but I think to be fair to Labor her comments have come after the last week of Liberal infighting
PRIME MINISTER:  Mate he might be out there at the stadium on Saturday night, mind you he’s a Roosters fan
INTERVIEWER:  So you’ve gone from coal-aphobia to recognising a climate emergency
SHORTEN:  Whether we’re young or forever young at heart, the Hundred Acre Wood calls to that place in each of us that still believes in magic
PRIME MINISTER:  Last months of World War II in April 1945.  As the Allies make their final push in the European Theater, a battle-hardened U
INTERVIEWER:  Fear can hold you prisoner.  Hope can set you free
PRIME MINISTER:  So these misperceptions that are out there, well that’s for them to explain
SHORTEN:  No the deal has to stack up on its own merits.  I do not support putting a single dollar of taxpayer money into this project
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, get to that in a moment. 
SHORTEN:  In the combustible action franchise's final installment, maverick detectives Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh square off against Asian mobster Wah Sing Ku, who's up to his neck in slave trading and counterfeit currency
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s an important part of our history and up in Cooktown, they’ll tell you all about it
INTERVIEWER:  So there won’t be any funding from this to go to underwriting of new coal, that money will be found elsewhere and I imagine you will require legislation?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well this is what the business case does.  The business case, we wouldn’t be doing the business case on the second interconnector, if we weren’t serious about actually following through and implementing that
SHORTEN:  When Sarah Marshall dumps aspiring musician Peter Bretter for rock star Aldous Snow, Peter's world comes crashing down
INTERVIEWER:  So that’s the plan they just stay on Nauru and Manus
SHORTEN:  No, I'm not going to criticise Kevin there, I think he's entitled to his opinion, he's earned it the hard way and I think also, in answering that question about Mr Rudd that's the difference between Labor and Liberal
PRIME MINISTER:  We won't be doing any preference deals with One Nation
INTERVIEWER:  Not enough. 
SHORTEN:  Well a good analogy I've always used because when I was a union rep sometimes we'd have to have change in workplaces was quite often  I saw corporate leaders say to everyone - use the analogy of a railway station - you're at railway station A and the corporate leaders would say righto to the workforce, you've got to get to railway station B
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that’s supposition, that’s speculation.  And what I said in the Parliament yesterday… see, as Prime Minister I've got to stay on the facts
INTERVIEWER:  Ok, but the government keeps telling us emissions are falling
PRIME MINISTER:  I do.  First of all I'll be calling in the Turkish Ambassador today to make my remarks directly to him
SHORTEN:  Hard-to-crack ex-CIA man, Jack Byrnes and his wife, Dina head for the warmer climes of Florida to meet son-in-law-to-be, Greg Focker's parents
INTERVIEWER:  Prime Minister I’ve asked you to explain it. 
SHORTEN:  I always enjoy talking to you guys.  
PRIME MINISTER:  Well they were very encouraged and it's great to be able to do that as a Prime Minister
INTERVIEWER:  Witness the defining chapter of the Middle-Earth saga
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's a very good point. 
SHORTEN:  So I've had a day off the bus and I'll go back on the bus on Monday
INTERVIEWER:  So why are you spending an extra $2 billion if you are reaching the target comfortably? Are you going to set new lower targets?
SHORTEN:  Julian, who runs a Thai boxing club as a front organization for his family's drug smuggling operation, is forced by his mother Crystal to find and kill the individual responsible for his brother's recent death
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I don't offer opinions on this, it's my job to beat it and that's what I'm doing and that's what the party elected me to do
INTERVIEWER:  Ok, according to your announcement there’s $2 billion there for loans by the government being offered through the banks - that’s how I understand it - at a lower interest rate
SHORTEN:  I can understand why Malcolm might say that but I have to say when you're Labor and you deal with some of the critique in the media you don't let it distract you from what's important
PRIME MINISTER:  Well in principle this is what our intention would be, but we’ve obviously got to see a report before we make a decision on that and that’s why the Treasurer has announced today that in a very measured process, over the weekend, once we receive that report which will be in the middle of a market day so you wouldn’t go and release it while the markets were open, the government will consider that over the weekend and provide an interim and initial, if not final, response on the Monday after the lockup after markets close
INTERVIEWER:  Bill Shorten just a final question for you talking about town halls, we read today that you have agreed with the Prime Minister Scott Morrison to a debate here in Perth on the April 29
PRIME MINISTER:  Well whether it’s water cartage or things like that but I do know those $1 million is getting to those councils and the Commonwealth Government has been working closely with those councils so they can get it ready
SHORTEN:  Tom and Hannah have been platonic friends for 10 years
INTERVIEWER:  Sure but how you can you can't compel them to live in those places
SHORTEN:  Good morning Edwina. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Hang on –
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, right okay. 
SHORTEN:  Yes, I was pleased.  I was pleased for the work of Dan Andrews and his team, nothing should take way from their success
PRIME MINISTER:  I mean, I was there and I say it didn’t happen. 
INTERVIEWER:  I think we all want to see people not drowning…
SHORTEN:  Let's just see, and I think it's not just Julie Bishop, to be fair to Ms Bishop
PRIME MINISTER:  No I don't. 
INTERVIEWER:  So you’re not expecting boats?
SHORTEN:  After proving himself on the field of battle in the French and Indian War, Benjamin Martin wants nothing more to do with such things, preferring the simple life of a farmer
PRIME MINISTER:  That’s true and the most pernicious is this retiree tax
INTERVIEWER:  Isn’t the reality, in fact though, that you’re on a tightrope, on the one hand you’ve got the coal lobby and the resources sector, some of whom are changing their mind, mind you, on one side, what works with the coal industry is disastrous for people who want action and more action on climate change, and you’re on that tightrope trying to juggle the two
SHORTEN:  Maybe we need to have a plebiscite  - I don't know
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah, well you see Jon, I have a very unique perspective on this because I was the one who had to stop it
INTERVIEWER:  Just a couple more on the politics of this.  Malcolm Turnbull said in his final press conference, that the truth is the Coalition finds it very hard to get agreement on anything to do with emissions, emissions issues and climate policy issues
PRIME MINISTER:  There is expenditure now and there's expenditure over 10 years, it's a big project Jon
SHORTEN:  A fairy tale love-story about pre-med student Paige who falls in love with a Danish Prince "Eddie" who refused to follow the traditions of his parents and has come to the US to quench his thirst for rebellion
INTERVIEWER:  That will be very welcome news in many quarters, Dawn Services are Dawn Services, they’re not 10 o’clock in the morning/morning tea services
PRIME MINISTER:  Or Bill Shorten for that matter, by the way. 
SHORTEN:  James Bond returns as the secret agent 007 one more time to battle the evil organization SPECTRE
INTERVIEWER:  Because of that development though, do you think that will have an impact on the thinking of some of the crossbenchers, and I’m thinking Cathy McGowan in particular and she might now be satisfied with that and she won't then support the Labor initiative?
PRIME MINISTER:  For these projects, so we’re just going to keep getting on with it, Jon
SHORTEN:  First of all, there are concerns that trade agreements provide some disadvantages as well as some advantages
INTERVIEWER:  Divided We Fall. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I don't believe so at all Fran, I think I just outlined it perfectly well
SHORTEN:  And if you don't have an explanation for how you're going to educate the kids or look after the sick or deal with our environment or make sure that we've got economic growth which is in the interests of everyone not just the lucky few, then people are going to say, they're going to look for more extreme solutions and just say no, we're not interested in this version of change which doesn't have a place for us in it
INTERVIEWER:  Or not be in it at all - they just want out. 
SHORTEN:  A dramatic thriller based on the incredible true David vs
PRIME MINISTER:  I'm not contemplating that situation.  I'm contemplating being re-elected and ensuring that we continue to keep Australia safe, secure borders, and keep our economy strong
INTERVIEWER:  That’s the ACF’s analysis of it. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Thanks Jon. 
SHORTEN:  Let's go to Citibank, they're an internationally reputable bank
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Finally, 2019, there's an election year as we've alluded to several times, for all of the campaigns in memory, the leaders of the major parties have committed to two prime time interviews during the campaign on 7
PRIME MINISTER:  There’s often the odd chat. 
SHORTEN:  Let's be fair here, Leigh.  Let’s be fair
INTERVIEWER:  Well the people who bullied us at school - that's how I looked at, those people that bullied me were going to now make the decision
SHORTEN:  Listen, the Liberals are lying about taxes.  Let's just call it as it is
PRIME MINISTER:  They have.  It was bipartisan policy and the reason they’re doing it is because they don’t know how to control their spending
INTERVIEWER:  So do we need to –
SHORTEN:  An  U. S
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh look, Bill and I, many years ago, before we were in politics, we travelled to Israel together on a joint delegation
INTERVIEWER:  But what do you talk to him about?
SHORTEN:  Oh no you're right.  It was five years ago and eight years ago and we've learned our lesson though
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, what a load of rubbish.  I mean these are unions using union-members fees to promote Bill Shorten
INTERVIEWER:  But do you care that something as clearly inaccurate as that, takes hold in the media as quickly as it does? It frankly flushes out the people that, it wouldn’t matter if you gave people $100,000, they still would have found a way to say; “Terrible Budget, they're on their way out”
SHORTEN:  Furious that her late father only willed her his gloomy-looking mansion rather than his millions, Carrigan Crittenden is ready to burn the place to the ground when she discovers a map to a treasure hidden in the house
PRIME MINISTER:  Well no he didn't.  He thought he was paying for them
INTERVIEWER:  What does that mean, what’s a state actor?
SHORTEN:  Three high school students make an incredible discovery, leading to their developing uncanny powers beyond their understanding
PRIME MINISTER:  Well look, I don't think you can generalize to be fair Ben, I think you just take each and every case, you apply your process, the discipline, the intelligence, the judgment and which there are very experienced people working on in this area
INTERVIEWER:  She sometimes struggles on the spelling too. 
PRIME MINISTER:  I have known Ita for a long time …
SHORTEN:  When a madman dubbed 'Scorpio' terrorizes San Francisco, hard-nosed cop, Harry Callahan – famous for his take-no-prisoners approach to law enforcement – is tasked with hunting down the psychopath
INTERVIEWER:  The warning was that when the Medivac Bill passed there'd be hundreds of applications immediately
SHORTEN:  First of all, they are 2 different issues. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, in both countries where they’ve been found refugees, they’re living in countries that have signed the refugee convention
INTERVIEWER:  It’s very much done in private. 
SHORTEN:  Of course not.  I just thought it was wrong and so, that was only a tiny taste
PRIME MINISTER:  A grieving mother transforms herself into a vigilante following the murders of her husband and daughter, eluding the authorities to deliver her own personal brand of justice
INTERVIEWER:  I'm saying the bill protected against that risk. 
PRIME MINISTER:  A true story of survival, as a young couple's chance encounter leads them first to love, and then on the adventure of a lifetime as they face one of the most catastrophic hurricanes in recorded history
SHORTEN:  It's about time we had the renewables revolution.  We're proposing to make it easier for households to buy solar powered batteries
INTERVIEWER:  Quite.  But could I just say on that, the notion that we want to get people out of the capital cities, a most laudable notion
PRIME MINISTER:  Raised in a poverty-stricken slum, a 16-year-old girl named Starr now attends a suburban prep school
SHORTEN:  Well, I think Mr Porter's problem is that the Prime Minister who he supported for the last three years say's there a problem and for the sake of certainty, you're best off referring it to the High Court
INTERVIEWER:  Her legend begins. 
PRIME MINISTER:  No, it’s not Ben.  So it was about the Budget, I was happy to do it and it was just being quite practical and sensible
SHORTEN:  We'll have more to say about energy policy in the next couple of months but I think you're right
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  Look forward to seeing you next year.  Bill Shorten, thank you
PRIME MINISTER:  Yes, to lower them. 
SHORTEN:  Listen, our immigration is one issue but let's talk about the failure of politics
INTERVIEWER:  All right.  While we've got you Bill Shorten, the children of notorious terrorist Khaled Sharrouf have pleaded to be allowed to come back home to Australia after years living in Islamic State territory
PRIME MINISTER:  We have had three national action plans now on countering domestic violence in Australia
SHORTEN:  At the moment they can be north of $10,000, so they're certainly not cheap
INTERVIEWER:  Okay just a couple of things before you go.  Kerryn Phelps has been in Parliament for five minutes, we now face 2008 revisited, when Labor abolished the Pacific solution
PRIME MINISTER:  The political parties do this under their own steam, just like any company or business does
SHORTEN:  Not paying attention to his job, a young demon allows the evil cleansing machine to overflow and explode, turning the young demon into the infamous monster Janemba
INTERVIEWER:  Well exactly!
SHORTEN:  Mowgli has been living in the man-village with his little stepbrother Ranjan and his best friend Shanti
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, I think because of a lack of awareness of our climate change policy and I think 
INTERVIEWER:  You have appealed to world leaders to crack down on social media platforms following the Christchurch Mosque attack
PRIME MINISTER:  But not all disrespect of women leads to violence
SHORTEN:  He's a vegetarian.  When a lie turns Oscar into an improbable hero and Lenny becomes an outcast, the two form an unlikely friendship
INTERVIEWER: Well, he’s campaigning against one of your ministers in Flinders
PRIME MINISTER:  Local council rate relief.   I spoke to local farmers yesterday and there rates are in the tens of thousands
SHORTEN:  Adam Sandler invites you to share some holiday cheer in the new, no-holds-barred musical comedy Adam Sandler's 8 Crazy Nights
INTERVIEWER:  Mr Shorten, thanks for joining us.  
SHORTEN:  Leigh, let's see how we go in the election first.  We haven't won and we haven't lost
PRIME MINISTER:  This program has absolute support right across the party because it deals with things that Malcolm started also on Snowy 2
INTERVIEWER:  Why have you given up on that, given as I say, that you were making the point a couple of years ago that it desperately needed to be cut for all businesses?
PRIME MINISTER:  There's no doubt that exists in Australia, there's no doubt that exists in Australia but there’s –
SHORTEN:  We haven't finalised our position, but I think that the unions and indeed a lot of people from the Reserve Bank onwards, are all saying that everything is going up in Australia except wages
INTERVIEWER:  It’s not the Government, it’s the Treasury figures
SHORTEN:  I think he should receive consular assistance beyond that, I don't know all the facts of the matter and he should deserve the ability to be able to represent it in court which he will be
PRIME MINISTER:  Well why has Bill Shorten not disassociated himself with the comments of Michael Daly in New South Wales?
INTERVIEWER:  But cheaper?
PRIME MINISTER:  An extremely wealthy elderly man dying from cancer undergoes a radical medical procedure that transfers his consciousness to the body of a healthy young man but everything may not be as good as it seems when he starts to uncover the mystery of the body's origins and the secret organization that will kill to keep its secrets
SHORTEN:  Yes it is disappointing Lisa.  It's not the way the arrangements are meant to work
INTERVIEWER:  I think that might be the likelihood of receiving one
SHORTEN: Sorry just to correct, when you say controversial, some in the property industry don't like negative gearing changes but a lot of people actually do like it
PRIME MINISTER:  On the practical issue of Longman –
INTERVIEWER:  Discover how it all began. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Armed with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, master thief Scott Lang must embrace his inner-hero and help his mentor, Doctor Hank Pym, protect the secret behind his spectacular Ant-Man suit from a new generation of towering threats
SHORTEN:  Set in 1977, back when sex was safe, pleasure was a business and business was booming, idealistic porn producer Jack Horner aspires to elevate his craft to an art form
INTERVIEWER:  It will be. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah it will be, both the State Government ourselves have been working towards that
SHORTEN:  Can a storybook view of romance survive in the real world?
INTERVIEWER:  The Kerryn Phelps… just one thing, can I sum up.  The Kerryn Phelps Bill as I see it simply, in language that struggle street understands, is outsourcing immigration policy to two doctors
SHORTEN:  In a mysterious and remote snowy outpost, Matt and Potter share a Christmas meal, swapping creepy tales of their earlier lives in the outside world, but are both men who they appear to be?
PRIME MINISTER:  Dracula, Mavis, Johnny and the rest of the Drac Pack take a vacation on a luxury Monster Cruise Ship, where Dracula falls in love with the ship’s captain, Ericka, who’s secretly a descendant of Abraham Van Helsing, the notorious monster slayer
INTERVIEWER:  Okay Prime Minister, just before we go, you speak a lot of boosting harmony, which a lot of people would agree with
PRIME MINISTER:  Oh, of course.   But, anyway, the Government will make a decision and we will go through the normal processes that are required in terms of consultation with the Opposition and on that, the rules on that are very clear by the way
SHORTEN:  An Israeli counterterrorism soldier with a secretly fabulous ambition to become a Manhattan hairstylist
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  So what emoji are you going to put on your number plate?
PRIME MINISTER:  Yeah and this helps them continue to do that and provides an economic basis for doing so, supporting jobs in rural and regional communities, particularly for indigenous Australians, who know how to manage the land and we are backing in them on doing that
SHORTEN:  Hope so, see you. 
INTERVIEWER:  The path to paradise begins in hell. 
PRIME MINISTER:  G’day Ben, g’day from Perth. 
SHORTEN:  Well I like Melissa.  I think she is an accomplished woman and she was a good Member of Parliament when she was there and she's also worked overseas for the United Nations and refugees so, I like her
INTERVIEWER:  Will we see you again –
PRIME MINISTER:  Well no, the bill actually could do that, if they were put in community detention in metropolitan parts of the city, that’s exactly –
SHORTEN:  During their travel from Chicago to New York, Harry and Sally debate whether or not sex ruins a friendship between a man and a woman
INTERVIEWER:  That’s it, good on you. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well that's not something that the Budget could sustain and what I also understand -  you know we also have a Newstart system, we have family tax benefits systems, we have a whole range of other payments and support that exist for people on low incomes
SHORTEN:  I'd say that's wrong.  Our position's very clear
INTERVIEWER:  Yes? Is that what you’re doing now?
SHORTEN:  I'd say that my view on this mine is going to be based on the best science, whether or not it stacks up, and if it is, if it stacks up and passes all the scientific tests, I won't engage in sovereign risk
PRIME MINISTER:  No it won't because it's a responsible cap.  The employer-nominated positions under the plan will be maintained
INTERVIEWER:  That concern, that if you punish the banks in a certain way then credit might dry up, is that a reasonable thing to keep in mind when you decide on penalties?
SHORTEN:  That's a really good point.  First of all, the government loves to say that if we are not going to give a tax subsidy to a property investor, somehow that’s a property tax
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, Kevin Rudd doesn't get to make decisions for the Liberal Party
INTERVIEWER:  No but it was hard.  And I'm going to say, you know, Wayne and I have been on TV on Gogglebox, we became poster boys for hate
SHORTEN:  Yes, we will, we will support boat turn backs where it's safe to do so, which is existing policy
PRIME MINISTER:  I will Alan.  Can I just mentioned one last this thing that I'm most pleased about in this Budget; that's the $461 million we're putting into combat youth suicide and mental health challenges in this country
INTERVIEWER: I want to come back to the Budget and how that might play out in a moment but in terms of ideas - there are already calls coming from within the Liberal Party for them to be less ideological on social issues and challenges such as climate change
SHORTEN:  No that was the other part of your question, I said come back to it
PRIME MINISTER:  A group of scientists in San Francisco struggle to stay alive in the aftermath of a plague that is wiping out humanity, while Caesar tries to maintain dominance over his community of intelligent apes
INTERVIEWER:  Well, look at that One Nation beast.  Pauline Hanson, is she a racist? 
SHORTEN:  No, not at all.  Did you know Karl that since they have got into power they have doubled the national debt? And what we have also seen is that they've had deficit upon deficit
PRIME MINISTER:  State governments fund TAFE, Jon.  State governments fund TAFE
INTERVIEWER:  And the money that you’re bringing for them, around $5
PRIME MINISTER:  That's my policy. 
SHORTEN:  A bigoted junkie cop suffering from bipolar disorder and drug addiction manipulates and hallucinates his way through the festive season in a bid to secure promotion and win back his wife and daughter
INTERVIEWER:  But have there been any applications made?
PRIME MINISTER:  No, I’m not going to split hairs with you Jon…
SHORTEN:  Cheerio, bye-bye. 
INTERVIEWER:  It’s not the Labor Party, it’s the people who work their fingers to the bone for the disabled
SHORTEN:  Yes 
PRIME MINISTER:  It goes much more than that.  I mean, there is a 13 week disaster allowance payment for those whose incomes are disrupted…
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  As you know, the Prime Minister has proposed tough new laws on terror, making it easy to strip Aussie citizenship from those convicted of terrorism offences
PRIME MINISTER: No I'm sorry Waleed, the bill didn't do that.  The bill didn't do that
SHORTEN:  That's right. 
INTERVIEWER:  He wants an effective banking system, he doesn't want credit to dry up
SHORTEN:  I had a dream. 
PRIME MINISTER:  You’ve also got to deal with this numpty legislation, which basically tells farmers what they can do on their own land
INTERVIEWER:  So what you’ve gone on, I’m going to ask you five questions
PRIME MINISTER:  Well I know that… yes, that have, they tried the same thing back in 2016
SHORTEN:  It won't have an appreciable impact on the price of housing
INTERVIEWER:  Mmhmm. 
SHORTEN:  And the Commonwealth public service. 
PRIME MINISTER:  What Labor did was weaken our border protection. 
INTERVIEWER:  Fear what's inside. 
SHORTEN:  That's where the political debate should be - the best ideas 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well, what we're doing for people who are looking for jobs is getting them into work
INTERVIEWER:  Newspoll is out today.   No big shift on those numbers
PRIME MINISTER:  It’s because they don't even know how Budgets work
SHORTEN:  Good on you, Karl.  Have a lovely day
INTERVIEWER:  I had a problem with the remote control, I got stuck
SHORTEN:  Advertising executive Nick Marshall is as cocky as they come, but what happens to a chauvinistic guy when he can suddenly hear what women are thinking? Nick gets passed over for a promotion, but after an accident enables him to hear women's thoughts, he puts his newfound talent to work against Darcy, his new boss, who seems to be infatuated with him
PRIME MINISTER:  Look, these are big projects Neil, they can't just be done by yesterday afternoon and they don't start unless the Commonwealth in this case, is prepared to make this sort of a commitment of $2 billion, which we have and we'll work with the State government
INTERVIEWER:  Is it? How do you know that?
PRIME MINISTER:  He paid back the money and that’s the end of the matter
SHORTEN:  Well first of all, full credit to Daniel Andrews and the State Labor Government
INTERVIEWER:  Why wouldn't you bring it on to a vote when Julie Bishop has virtually invited you to do so?
SHORTEN:  Thanks guys. 
PRIME MINISTER:  Well they’re not ones that exist certainly within my Party
INTERVIEWER:  Oh so this is just a business case?
SHORTEN:  Based on the classic novel by Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game is the story of the Earth's most gifted children training to defend their homeplanet in the space wars of the future
PRIME MINISTER:  Employment growth continues because we've got unemployment down to the lowest level in the last decade, Fran
[Laughter]
INTERVIEWER:  So you're worried that they might be bluffing and in the end, they wouldn't support you?
PRIME MINISTER:  Well it’s not legislation, it’s part of code.  What I’m saying is, I used to be the Immigration Minister, you know, it’s my signature on many Australians’ citizenships today
SHORTEN:  A fair go for all.  We're going to invest in people and invest in infrastructure
INTERVIEWER:  This was a meeting about campaign strategy and you were saying –
SHORTEN:  Well we are putting forward a series of recommendations
PRIME MINISTER:  Waleed let me just say for the record -
INTERVIEWER:  We just had a chat with David Baker, the principal of Gippsland Grammar, and he was saying he gets fed up with this discussion whenever we're coming up to an election and that private schools like his are extremely important in educating kids in places like Gippsland
PRIME MINISTER:  I don’t really care what they think. 
SHORTEN:  Because it is costing $6 billion.  The reality is that when you go to hospital it costs a lot more than $2000, I need to find money for our ageing population
INTERVIEWER:  Coal-fired power.  Listen, good to talk to you
SHORTEN:  We talk about a strong minimum wage, we don't talk about the top two percent of Australians not having to pay tax
PRIME MINISTER:  Blake Redding is trapped in this dark room wanting to protect his love so the only thing he will do is escape like no failed student has done before
INTERVIEWER:  Is there any is there any evidence or suggestion that could have been an attempt to interfere with our democratic process?
SHORTEN:  An uptight by-the-book cop must protect the widow of a drug boss from crooked cops and gunmen
