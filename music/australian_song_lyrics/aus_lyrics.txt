When success is on your mind
But true direction is missing
You know the Gods have lied - but you're still smitten
By the stars in your eyes
I can tell you know where you are
Smile sweetly and you'll be forgiven
You're almost free - almost free to come and go
Bed sitting room for ambitious prisoner

Walk away, don't take no for an answer
Turn a blind eye to it all
Let sleeping dogs lie
Down in Queensway

Like a bulldozer chasing butterflies
Down sad English streets you wander
Over sleeping bodies you step lightly
All the snow on the ground
- lets you pass by without a sound
One last look before you disappear

Walk away, don't take no for an answer
Turn a blind eye to it all
Let sleeping dogs lie
Down in Queensway
Never wanted more
From my local store
A chance to be by myself
Be on the right side of the shelf
But for every drink I serve
Sure wish I had callous nerve
Cause for every sandwich I know
There's a sack of shit to be dosed
Wash my hands in shame
4000 times a day
And when I make it on home
There's a smell that always stays
I know the regulars well
From every stale grill I sell
From bainmaries to cold tea
I'm the service that you need

There's a poison in my drink
It's gonna take each good thought I could think
There's a poison I know

Wash my hands in shame
4000 times a day
For while I service your greed
I'm just dying to be clean
Step lively my friend take cover
Be sure beware of this other lover
She's cool she's you
She's oh so shrewd and she's on to you
So steady Eddie think clearly be ready
Sometimes your heart can be unsteady
She's on time she's on line
She's push and shove 'cause your her goldmine

Shutdown shutdown
You should shutdown on her hey
Shutdown shutdown
Close on up don't walk her way

Colour conscious from top to toe
V.I.P. spends her money on the snow
Her slim waist her good taste
She'll go in slow but she'll up the pace
You're her ticket to the swinging jet set
You'll make her someone you're her best bet
So look sharp play the part
Think with your mind and not your heart

Walk her way

Love is easy love is so unkind
Some are sleazy love is so blind
Her blue eyes her bust size
She's done her homework and I'm not surprised
So step lively my friend, take cover
Beware be sure of this other lover
She's on time she's on line
She's push and shove' cause you're her goldmine

One hour one day
Somehow someway
She'll Shutdown she'll shutdown
So close it up and save your alimony
Your alimony

Your alimony
I got a heavy little number
I got 42 wheels of pleasure and pain
I got a heavy little number
I'm gonna head it on down upon the Alice again

Widda a paraliddic weapon I can 'ardly miss
Gonna gidda bricks anudder everlasting kiss
Widda a paraliddic weapon I can 'ardly miss
Gonna gidda bricks anudder everlasting kiss

Hadda spit the dummy do a Jaws of Life job
Hadda leave a big impression onna paraliddic mob
Hadda spit the dummy do a Jaws of Life job
Hadda leave a big impression onna paraliddic mob

Make it a Jaws of Life job
Make it a Jaws of Life job
The faces in the photograph have faded
And I can't believe he looks so much like me
For it's been ten years today
Since I left for Old Cork Station
Sayin' I won't be back till the drovin's done

For the rain never falls on the dusty Diamantina
And a drover finds it hard to change his mind
For the years have surely gone
Like the drays from Old Cork Station
And I won't be back till the drovin's done

Well it seems like the sun comes up each mornin'
Sets me up and takes it all away
For the dreaming by the light
Of the camp fire at night
Ends with the burning by the day

For the rain never falls on the dusty Diamantina
And a drover finds it hard to change his mind
For the years have surely gone
Like the drays from Old Cork Station

And I won't be back till the drovin's done

Sometimes I think I'll settle back in Sydney
But it's been so long it's hard to change my mind
For the cattle trail goes on and on
And the fences roll forever
And I won't be back till the drovin's done

For the rain never falls on the dusty Diamantina
And a drover finds it hard to change his mind
For the years have surely gone
Like the drays from Old Cork Station
And I won't be back till the drovin's done

For the rain never falls on the dusty Diamantina
And a drover finds it hard to change his mind
For the years have surely gone
Like the drays from Old Cork Station
And I won't be back when the drovin's done
Gave you a necklace in purple and blue
You took it so gently, I felt see through
The sky was bright with the satellites
The wire door slammed and the night began
We drank and were together
Then you laughed at the sound of the crowd around Christ
I really like you

Sat on the steps and we watched the view
The house was full but there was only you
Time was right because you told it too
You laughed at the way I moved around
You said my feet never hit the ground
I look away but then I couldn't move
I really like you

Hear the sound of the cars downtown
As the lighthouse sweeps its arms around
Drive me home I want to see you alone
Beaded so fine like Spanish wine
My gift is yours so read my mind
Let it be
You see through me

Sat on the steps with thoughts of you
The house was full I couldn't move
Time was right because you told it too
I really like you

Take me home
Lock it up
Take me home
Lock it up
I gave you a necklace Purple and Blue
You took it so gently I felt see through

Take me home
Lock it up
Take me home
Lock it up
What am I to you?
What am I to do?
Now summer's almost through in September
For love has come and gone
Didn't stay for long;
One thing I will always remember
When the green, whispering leaves had called your name
The gentle, sighing winds, they did the same
Now the sun has left the sky
And for no reason why
A sad cloud is crying tears of rain
We stood and watched the rain;
Perhaps we will again
For no one knows what's coming tomorrow
One day you may find
That I am close behind;
Wherever you may go I will follow
And the green, whispering leaves will call your name;
The gentle, sighing winds will do the same
Now the sun is in the sky
And for no reason why
The sad cloud is crying itself away
And the green, whispering leaves will call your name;
The gentle, sighing winds will do the same
Now the sun is in the sky
And for no reason why
The sad cloud is crying itself away
The water is wide I can't cross o'er
Nor do I have light wings to fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I

A ship there is and sails the sea
She's loaded deep as deep can be
But not so deep as the love I'm in
And I know not how I sink or swim

When love is young and love is fine
It's like a gen when first it's new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like the morning dew

The water is wide I can't cross o'er
Nor do I have light wings to fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I

It's after 12 
Can't face the day
Remind me how hard it can be 
To forget
I said things I didn't mean
You saw things you shouldn't have seen

Been a naughty girl
Real bad so and so
Done too many things a girl shouldn't know
I swear I never knew
I could hurt you so
One too many things a girl shouldn't know

Can't take the sadness 
From your eyes
Can't put the truth back in my lies
Oh whoa
Don't make me try and explain
Let's just start over again

Been a naughty girl
Real bad so and so
Done too many things a girl shouldn't know
I swear I never knew
I could hurt you so
One too many things a girl shouldn't know

The more you try to stay
The more I let you go
Done too many things a girl shouldn't know
I swear I never knew
I could hurt you so
One too many things a girl shouldn't know

Won't stop and try to turn the clock back
I won't beg - I'm no good at that
Too late to start and act like a saint
Can't be something that I ain't

Been a naughty girl
Real bad so and so
Done too many things a girl shouldn't know
I swear I never knew
I could hurt you so
One too many things a girl shouldn't know

The more you try to stay
The more I let you go
From one too many things a girl shouldn't know
I swear I never knew
I could hurt you so
One too many things a girl shouldn't know

Been a naughty girl
Been a naughty girl

So you think you're so refi-ined, ahead of your ti-ime
Leavin' all your friends behind, are you hopin' to fi-ind
Love is a city, 'cause you're young and feelin' pretty
But you won't even know your na-ame
So you think it's all good fun, a movie parade
You spe-end your best days in the su-un, with the new friends you made
But when you've got trouble you don't look back
They wo-on't know ya, they won't even know-ow your name
Slow down, hot town burn like a fever, Lyin' in the back o' your mind
Slow down, hot town burn like a fever, Sneakin' up on you from behind
You better slow down, hot town burns like a fever
Lyin' in the back o' your mind
You better slow down, hot town burns like a fever
Creepin' up on you from behind
So you think you've go-ot it made, at least for a while
A-always sittin' in the sha-ade, adjustin' your smi-ile
But I don't like to shake you, don't you know, you had it comin'
But they don't even know-ow your name
You better slow down, hot town burns like a fever
Lyin' in the back o' your mi-ind
Slow down, hot town burns like a fever, Sneakin' up on you from behi-i-ind
No one ever told her or showed her the way
No one ever told her or showed her
Better slow down, hot town burns like a fever, Lyin' in the back o' your mi-ind
Slow down, hot town burns like a fever, Sneakin' up on you from behind
Better slow down, Hot town burns like a fever
Burnin' up, Burnin' in the back o' your mind
Slow down, hot town burns like a fever, It's creepin' up
It's creepin' up on you from behind
Slow down, hot town burns like a fever
Oh-oh, burnin' up, oh-oh burnin' in the back o' your

Can't help myself , bad habits
Well I'm running wild, lost control
And it's a shame to think
That a boy like me
Has got so many , bad habits

Well I'm off the rails
My resistance fails tempations got
A hold on me
And I can't refuse
Because I always lose
Can't help myself
Bad habits

Well it just ain't right
That it's something I can't fight
I can't stop going out and having fun
Well I tried to be good
But I knew I never could
Cause I've got more bad habits than anyone

When I get the urge
I just got to splurge
I'm a slave to all my desires
Well I'm in a mess
Because I can't repress all of these
Bad habits

Can't help myself
Bad Habits
Well I'm running wild
Lost control
And it's a shame to see
That a boy like me
Has so many bad habits

Well it just ain't right
It's something I can't fight
I can't stop going out and having fun
Well I tried to be good
But I knew I never could
Cause I've got more bad habits
Than anyone

When I get the urge
I just got to splurge
I'm a slave to all my desires
Well I'm in a mess
Because I can't repress all of these
Bad habits

All of these Bad habits x3

Have you heard the news of my love?
Did they send a message down?
That I'm on the march with my love
And I'm death or glory bound
From the mountains to the marshes
Now my love is gaining ground

Give in to my love
Give in to my love
Give in to my love
Give in to my love

Well I want to show you my love
It's bigger than a Cadillac
But you keep up your resistance
And you try to drive me back
I want to show you all my love
It's bigger than a Cadillac

Now my love is like a drunkard
Holding up the bar
He'll say the same thing over
And he'll fix you with his stare
You try and change the subject
But you won't escape the war

Baby, you were always gonna be the one
You only ever did it just for fun
But you run to paradise
Jenny, I'll meet you at the grocery store
You don't need a friend when you can score
You run to paradise

Johnny
We were always best of friends
Stick together and defend
But you run to paradise
And Mamma, now don't you worry 'bout me anymore
And I see you crying at the door
When I run to paradise

That's right, they had it all worked out
You were young and blonde and you could never do wrong
That's right, they were so surprised
You opened their eyes up
(opened their eyes up)
Opened their eyes up

You don't want anyone
(You don't, you don't, open your eyes up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, your no fool)
Don't tell me, this is paradise
(Open your eyes up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, open your eyes up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, your no fool)
Don't tell me, this is paradise

Good times, why'd I let them slip away
Why'd I let them slip away
Cause I lived in paradise
Run to paradise
Run to paradise
Run to paradise

Jesus say's it's gonna be alright
He's gonna pat my back so I can walk in the light
(That's right !)
You don't mind if I abuse myself
So I can hold my head up
(Hold my head up)
Hold my head up

You don't want anyone
(You don't, hold your head up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, your no fool)
Don't tell me, this is paradise
(Open your eyes up)
You don't need anyone
You don't need anyone (you don't)
You'll tell me, this is paradise

You don't want anyone
(You don't, hold your head up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, your no fool)
You'll tell me, this is paradise
(Open your eyes up)
You don't need anyone
You don't want anyone, (you don't)
You'll tell me, this is paradise

Mmm
If the fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
And now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion

Coz if you're not really there
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
Coz if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

Mmm

I look up into the night sky
I see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel the weight of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real

Coz if you're not really there
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
Coz if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
(Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold, black and gold, black and gold)

Mmm
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Coz if you're not really there
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
Coz if you're not really there
I don't wanna be either
I wanna be, next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Nicky's in the corner 
With a black coat on 
Running from a bad home 
With some cat inside

Now where did you find her 
Among the neon lights 
That haunt the streets outside 
She says...stay with me

Beautiful girl 
(Stay with me) 
Beautiful girl 
(Stay with me) 
She wants to go Home

From door way to door way 
Street corner to corner 
With the neon ghosts in the city 
And she says

Stay with me 
Stay with me 
Stay with me 
Stay with me

She's so scared 
So very frightened 
Anything could happen 
Right here tonight

Beautiful girl 
(Stay with me) 
Beautiful girl 
(Stay with me) 
She wanna  go Home

Stay with me 
(Beautiful girl) 
Stay with me 
(Beautiful girl) 
Stay with me 
(Beautiful girl) 
Stay with me 
(Beautiful girl)

I watch my t.v. screen, life flashing before me
So tell me what does that mean? And why does it bore me?
Come on, let me show you how to do it

I hear the radio and the songs they play
Makin' my stomach turn
I just want to hear some rock 'n' roll
I watch my radio burn
Come on, let me show you how to do it
Come on, let me show you how to do it

I see the plastic people, leading plastic lives
Substitute child, disposable wife
Follow your TV, it is your guide
The family cries when the TV dies
Come on, let me show you how to do it
Come on, let me show you how to do it

've always been in trouble
With the boy inside the man
Yes he loves to have a good time
He's so good at being bad
Oh yeah I wouldn't fight it
I wouldn't fight it even if I knew how
Oh no you couldn't stop us
We're making all the noise

Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys
You know they don't have a choice
Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys

Now the wisdom that the years bring
Can't help us anymore
We're the last to leave the party
The first to ask for more
Oh yeah now don't you worry
Don't you worry what tomorrow's gonna bring
Oh no you couldn't stop us
Making all the noise

Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys
You know they don't have a choice
Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys

They're always telling me
Hey boy you can't do that
You been a child too long
It's time for you to grow up
I put that old mask on
It didn't last that long
You're gonna have to take me like I am

So now you're getting older
Don't try to settle down
You gotta live it to the limit
And that's why…

Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys
You know they don't have a choice
Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys

Boys will be boys, boys, boys
Boys will be boys, boys, boys
Boys will be boys, boys, boys
Boys will be boys
I nurse my mother in a mudbrick room
She weaves her days on a blanket loom
I face conscription when I reach eighteen
Old men starve and widows sigh
Behind the fences corn grows high
Every night there’s a disco
For the pimps and marketeers

Fat landowners know no shame
Trade Swiss francs and quaff champagne
In the hills they grow cocaine
For the dealers from the north
There’s no grave for heroes here
Some speak out and conquer fear
Every week more disappear
There’s blood upon the rain

Pall Mall softpacks, American guns
Government troops bask in the sun
Drawing straws for the whores from the shanty town
Beneath the truncheons you bow and scrape
You learn to hustle, you learn to hate
Bolt the doors when the squads patrol
And terror stalks the night

Suffer my country, children weep
So much pain and oh so deep
The people sow and the fascists reap
And conscience has no name
A new beginning or a hangman’s rope
While caution slept, our courage woke
We took up arms and we took up hope
There’s blood upon the rain

Clutch your life in each short breath
Another skirmish, a nameless death
The tracks are mined and there’s snipers in the trees
The mountain mists hide for years
Our silent power, our faith and tears
The valley streams are poisoned

And the gunships scour the plains
Cock your rifle, mumble prayers
Lying in ambush, wet and scared
Far from towns were dull eyes stare
And tequila loosens tongues
Feel the strength, feel the fire
A nation caged behind barbed wire
A million hearts with one desire
There’s blood upon the rain

Companeros, eyes that shine
Close as brothers, we pass the wine
The future’s ours, seize the time
And fan the rising flame
Kill the beast and life begins
Silently we spread our wings
If harvests fall, we reap the wind
There’s blood upon the rain
(John Lennon & Paul McCartney)

I look at all the lonely, people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice
In the church where the wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong

Father Mackenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody's there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong

I, Look at all the lonely people
I, Look at all the lonely people
I, Look at all the lonely people

I, Look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came

Father Mackenzie wiping the dirt from his hands
As he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong

[I look at all the lonely people]
[I look at all the lonely people] all the lonely people where do they all come from
[I look at all the lonely people] all the lonely people where do they all come from
[I look at all the lonely people] all the lonely people where do they all come from

What on earth am i meant to do
In this crowded place there is only you
Was gonna leave
Now I have to stay
You have taken my breath away

(ooh)
Is the world still spinning around (spinning around)
(ooh)
I don't feel like coming down

-Chorus-
It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you

Destiny has a funny way
When it comes and takes all your cares away
I can't think of a single thing
Other than what a beautiful state I'm in

(ooh)
Is the world still spinning around (spinning around)
(ooh)
I don't feel like coming down

They're on the starting line, doves in the air-air
Eyes on a target, enemy everywhere
Here she comes again now, hear the crowd sigh
Down on my courage
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, yeah-yeah

Hey let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey let's go, let's go, let's go - Hey let's go, let's go
She's the one, she's the one, she's the one, she's the one
She's the one, she's the one, she's the one

Gotta stop my tremblin', gotta do it right
Lookin' in the mirror, fix my hair right
Here she comes again now, hear the boys sigh
Feel my heart a-thumpin'
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, yeah-yeah

Hey let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey let's go, let's go, let's go - Hey let's go, let's go
She's the one, she's the one, she's the one, she's the one
She's the one, she's the one, she's the one

In my dreams I've seen this, maybe a thousand times
In my dreams I've known that
I've gotta make the girl mine, mine, mine, mine
Gotta stop my tremblin', I've gotta do it right
Feel my heart thumpin'
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, yeah-yeah

Hey let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey let's go, let's go, let's go - Hey let's go, let's go
She's the one, she's the one, she's the one, she's the one
She's the one, she's the one, she's the one

Hey let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey let's go, let's go, let's go - Hey let's go, let's go
She's the one, she's the one, she's the one, she's the one
She's the one, she's the one, she's the one

BOUND FOR GLORY

Many years ago I had a vision
The vision became reality
Making myself heard was my decision
To show my devotion and loyalty
Now many people have come and gone
Maybe they just weren't meant to be
But there was man who had to carry on
And that man, it was me

There comes a time in a man's life when you have to stand by what you believe
Your true friends will stand by you while others decide to leave
You face the pressures of every day life, they try to grind you down
But to your heart you remain true, for glory you are bound

I'm just a skinhead bound for glory
With guitar in my hand I will tell you my story
You may find my music discriminatory
But I'm just a skinhead bound for glory

Now many years have passed before me, right before my eyes
I have seen the heartbreak and sorrow, before the media's lies
But that heartbreak and sorrow has made a better man of me
Mister I will never change, for this is my destiny
The problems may be never ending, we're always fighting disparity
But the music must still go on, forever, for eternity

Solo after solo after solo
There was a friend of mine on murder
And the judge's gavel fell
Jury found him guilty
Gave him sixteen years in hell
He said I ain't spending my life here
I ain't living alone
Ain't breaking no rocks on the chain gang
I'm breakin' out and headin' home

Gonna make a jailbreak
And I'm lookin' towards the sky
I'm gonna make a jailbreak
Oh, how I wish that I could fly

All in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
Got to be free

Jailbreak, let me out of here
Jailbreak, sixteen years
Jailbreak, had more than I can take
Jailbreak, yeah

He said he'd seen his lady being fooled with
By another man
She was down and he was up
He had a gun in his hand
Bullets started flying everywhere
And people started to scream
Big man lying on the ground
With a hole in his body
Where his life had been
But it was

All in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
I got to be free

Jailbreak, jailbreak
I got to break out
Out of here

Heartbeats they were racin'
Freedom he was chasin'
Spotlights, sirens, rifles firing
But he made it out
With a bullet in his back

Jailbreak, jailbreak
Jailbreak, jailbreak
Jailbreak, jailbreak
Jailbreak, jailbreak
Jailbreak, jailbreak
A city girl is happy with her friends and family life
Appreciates a wine with him at night
She tries to find the sparkle, she searches but it's gone
With lots of love she hopes he'll be alright
Her man has gone all quiet he's not at ease
He doesn't feel at home he's hard to please
He gets itchy feet he's tired of noises in the street
He needs to walk for hours through the trees

No a bushman can't survive on city lights
Opera rock and roll and height of heights
His moon shines on the silver brigalow
Shimmers down the inland river flow
Out there where the yellow belly bites

He's working with his hands today on a building site
He can smell the Cypress on the floor
It takes him to a sandy ridge out amongst the pines
No shearin' no ploughin' anymore

His kelpie dog is tired and fast asleep
Sick of searchin' gardens for the sheep
His master doesn't whistle tunes he's not in the mood
His love for open spaces runs too deep

He tries to please his woman the lady of his life
He's standing at a party with a plate
She finds him on the balcony staring at the moon
An old familiar face he can relate

His moon shines on the silver brigalow
Shimmers down the inand river
Out there where the yellow belly bites
hey hey
when everything goes wrong
sometimes it makes no sense
hey hey
there once was a time
I should have known better then
hey hey
although you may try
it won't come your way again
hey little girl
where will you hide
who can you run to now
hey little girl
where will you go
who can you turn to now
hey hey
so why should I care
if somebody let you down
hey hey
that's nothing new
I know just what that can mean
hey hey
well the way that they talk
the talk is all over town
hey hey
and it's no surprise
little girls hurt sometimes
hey little girl
where will you hide
who can you run to now
hey little girl
where will you go
who can you turn to now
hey hey
when everything goes wrong
sometimes it makes no sense
hey hey
hey little girl
I should have known better
known better then
hey hey
hey little girl
where will you hide
who can you run to now
hey little girl
where will you hide
who can you run to now
hey little girl
where will you go
who can you turn to now

Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh reckless abandon
Like no one's
Watching you

A moment, a love
A dream, a laugh
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love
A dream,  a laugh
A moment, a love
A dream, a laugh

So stay there
Cause i'll be comin over
And while our bloods still young
It's so young
It runs
And we won't stop til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

Songs
Of desperation
I Played them for you
A moment, a love
A dream, a laugh
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love
A dream, a laugh
A moment, a love
A dream, a laugh
I won't drink, I won't smoke
Won't get home at a hundred o'clock
Nobody goin' to satisfy me
Except you and the baby and the colour TV

I was always in my prime
Now I'm falling over the line
They boys are sad to have to let me go
But you got it all to get me home

'Cause you quiet me down
I been all over the place and I ain't found anyone
Can keep my feet on the ground, no

We can be bigger than my old habits
Over my dead body but still
If I am awake in the morning
We'll be royal in the afternoon

You'll be the Queen and I'll be the mad King of it all

The words of a drunk fade with the light
Satan delivers and the goods are alright
He's at home now counting the dough
I'm standing here for another last throw

We can be bigger than my old habits
Over my dead body but still
If I am awake in the morning
We'll be royal in the afternoon
Where is the sun
That shone on my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead
Where is the light
That would play
In my streets
And where are the friends
I could meet
I could meet

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind
Where is the sun
That shone on my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where is the girl I loved
All along
The girl that I loved
She's gone
She's gone

All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life 've gone away
All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life 've gone away
Everybody

Spicks and Specks
Spicks and Specks
Someday I'll have money
Money isn't easy, to come by
By the time it's come by I'll be gone
I'll sing my song and I'll be gone

Some day I'll have lovin'
Lovin' isn't easy, to come by
By the time it's come by I'll be gone
I'll sing my song and I'll be gone

Oh oh

Lived a life of luxury
Doesn't seem to be for me, be for me
Movin' around comes naturally
Movin' around and feelin' free
That's for me

Someday I'll have money
Money isn't easy, to come by
By the time it's come by I'll be gone
I'll sing my song and I'll be gone

Some day I'll have lovin'
Lovin' isn't easy, to come by
By the time it's come by I'll be gone
I'll sing my song and I'll be gone

Oh oh

Lived a life of luxury
Doesn't seem to be for me, be for me
Movin' around comes naturally
Movin' around and feelin' free
That's for me

Someday I'll have money
Money isn't easy, to come by
Lovin' isn't easy, to come by
Neither of them easy, to come by
By the time they've come by I'll be gone
I'll sing my song and I'll be gone
I am a wealthy barrister
About 100 bucks a word
I've got a plum stuck in my mouth
I'm really such a
Really such a turd

I attended PAC
I meet a wife at the prefects' ball
I am the elder fotheringay
And she was apprentice
She was apprentice whore

I passed my matriculation
Four Ds and a C
Daddy bought be a Mercedes Benz
And he bought me a law de'
Bought me a law degree

I voted for Mal Fraser
Was the decent thing to do
Was a vote against the communists
And I hope that you did
Hope that you did too

I love to read the bulletin and watch the ABC
I love to wear by well-informed opinions constantly
All my friends are professionals from polite society
So come and sing the middle class Liberal
I've got a home in Beaumont Rag with me

I bought a brand new Range Rover
The outback is a lark
I slip it into four-wheel drive
At gates of national
Gates of national park

Oh the working class are out of place
When they are on strike
I drive my Jag in circles
Trying to knock them off their
Knock them off their bikes

I love to read the bulletin and watch the ABC
I love to wear by well-informed opinions constantly
All my friends are professionals from polite society
So come and sing the middle class Liberal
I've got a home in Beaumont Rag with
Come and sing the middle class Liberal

Counting The Beat-

I look at the sunrise,
I look at it burn
I look into your eyes, 
don't know where to turn

I'm gonna drift into that void
I'm flying through space

Say goodbye my own true lover
As we sing a lovers song
How it breaks my heart to leave you
Now the carnival is gone

High above the dawn is waiting
And my tears are falling rain
For the carnival is over
We may never meet again

Like a drum, my heart was beating
And your kiss was sweet as wine
But the joys of love are fleeting
For Pierrot and Columbine

Now the harbour light is calling
This will be our last goodbye
Though the carnival is over
I will love you till I die

Like a drum, my heart was beating
And your kiss was sweet as wine
But the joys of love are fleeting
For Pierrot and Columbine

Now the harbour light is calling
This will be our last goodbye
Though the carnival is over
I will love you till I die
Though the carnival is over
I will love you till I die
Sometimes I think I'm just a crazy cat
Running around, don't know where it's at
Getting confused with my way of life
That's when you say, now you cut that jive

Right now, right now
You keep this flame I have alight in me
And with this cat, it's curiosity
That keeps me hanging on night and day

Surprisingly, again I hear you say
Guess what, guess what, curiosity killed the cat
I'm telling you I know where it's at
Love is everywhere to be found
Open your eyes and look around

You, you, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Some things you say take me by surprise
I like your style so give me your advice
Send me the truth and I'll always be
Singing your song with you in harmony

That's right, that's right, curiosity killed the cat
I'm telling you I know where it's at
Love is everywhere to be found
Open your eyes and look around

Curiosity killed the cat
I'm telling you I know where it's at
Love is everywhere to be found
Open your eyes and look around
You, you, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, oh

My baby, my baby
My baby, yeah

I know this little girl she's quite a picture
I do my very best, oh boy, to keep her
She's got what it takes to warm my soul
Maybe it's the way she wears no makeup
Doesn't think she's got the legs that shape up
She can't rock but boy she can roll

I know I got
My baby, my baby
My baby, yeah

She's all that I need
Hanging around
She's all that I want
She makes my world feel good to me
We turn on in the most peculiar places
Many people turn with bowed red faces
We don't care what they think all the same

I know I got
My baby, my baby
My baby, now
Yeah

She's all that I need
Hanging around
She's all that I want
She makes my world feel good to me
I got this little girl she's quite a picture
Ain't no-one anywhere ever gonna steal her
She has won my heart, I love her so

I know I got
My baby, my baby
My baby, yeah

Talkin' 'bout
My baby
She's my baby
My baby now
I've been around the world
A couple of times or maybe more
I've seen the sights, I've had delights
On every foreign shore
But when my mates all ask me
The place that I adore
I tell them right away

Give me a home among the gumtrees
With lots of plum trees
A sheep or two, a k-kangaroo
A clothesline out the back
Verandah out the front
And an old rocking chair

You can see me in the kitchen
Cooking up a roast
Or Vegemite on toast
Just you and me, a cup of tea
And later on, we'll settle down
And go out on the porch
And watch the possums play

There's a Safeways up the corner
And a Woolies down the street
And a brand new place they've opened up
Where they regulate the heat
But I'd trade them all tomorrow
For a little bush retreat
Where the kookaburras call

Some people like their houses
With fences all around
Others live in mansions
And some beneath the ground
But me I like the bush you know
With rabbits running round
And a pumpkin vine out the back
I kiss the ground on which you walk
I kiss the lips through which you talk
I kiss the city of New York where I first met you
You're my doll and don't forget it
Cause I'm the guy who will regret it
I love you more than when I said it when I first met you
I love the way you talk, you walk, you smile, your style
Like now, Like, wow-wipeout! No doubt
I was gone the moment I laid eyes on you
You'll never be a beauty queen
Won't feature in no magazine
But you're the best that's ever been
I'm glad that I met you
Take every day now as it comes
You take the cake I'll keep the crumbs
I only hear the sound of drums in my heart
(that means that I get you.)
I love the way you walk, you talk, you smile, your style
Your dress, your caress
Well, yes, yes, yes I am impressed
I was gone the moment I laid eyes on you
Love is in the air
Everywhere I look around
Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound

And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when I look in your eyes

Love is in the air
In the whisper of the trees

Love is in the air

In the thunder of the sea

And I don't know if I'm just dreaming
Don't know if I feel sane
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when you call out my name

Love is in the air
Love is in the air
Oh oh oh

Love is in the air
In the rising of the sun
Love is in the air
When the day is nearly done

And I don't know if you're an illusion
Don't know if I see it true
But you're something that I must believe in
And you're there when I reach out for you

Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound
And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe inr

And it's there when I look in your eyes

Welcome, strangers, to the show
I'm the one who should be lying low
Saw the knives out, turned my back
Heard the train coming, stayed out on the track
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things 

Caught the fever, heard the tune
Thought I loved her, hung my heart on the moon
Started howling, made no sense
Thought my friends would rush to my defence
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things 

And I get all your good advice
It doesn't stop me from going through these things twice
I see the knives out, I turn my back
I hear the train coming, I stay right on that track
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things
I melted wax to fix my wings
I've done all the dumb things
I threw my hat into the ring
I've done all the dumb things
I thought that I just had to sing
I've done all the dumb things
Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh (x7)

Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh
Thunder  (x7)

Thunder (x3)

I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)

Sound of the drums
Beatin' in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart
You've been - thunderstruck

Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas, yeah Texas
And we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

Now the shakin' at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah the ladies were too kind
You've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah yeah yeah, thunderstruck

Oh, thunderstruck
Yeah

Now we're shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?

Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah yeah yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah

Said yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
So fine

Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Whoa baby, thunder, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck
This alligator engine
This alligator man
See him try to leave this swampland
Drove it out across this land, and see
All the guards get petrified
As he pushed them to the ground
With this alligator engine
With this alligator sound
See him try to leave this swampland
Wriggle out across this ground and then
All the guards are screaming now
'Cos this territory's cold
This alligator engine
This alligator soul
He tried to leave this swampland
To wriggle out up of his hole
And then all the guards are screaming now
As he pushed them to the ground
With this alligator engine
With this alligator sound
Goes out across this swampland
Wriggles out across this ground and see
All the guards are screaming now
This territory's cold
This alligator engine
This alligator man
Wriggle out across this swampland
Drove it out across this land, and see
All the guards get petrified
As he pushed them to the ground
With this alligator engine
With this alligator sound
The axe is swift and reckless
Feel the grain, split it wide
Cut away to build the mansions
Of banks and boards in distant hands
The axeman looks to the sun
Covered eyes, blind to silence

The future is eroding
The sacred past destroyed
No damning feats of progress
Comfort the unemployed
The earth is shred and skun
Fortune seekers hit and ru-un

Barren earth, poisoned skies, wasted seas

Will we see the light through the trees
Before the last axe falls

A sweet breeze of rage is blowing
From forest to the town
Slowly the tide is turning
With love the seed is sown
No time for feeling helpless
We've change to make
While there's still li-ife

Lessons learnt quickly fade, memories
Will we see the light through the trees
As the last axe falls
Ever since this troubled world began
Every woman and man
Trying to find some purpose in their lives
Some way to survive
And I'm the same
I'm not ashamed:
Riddle's my middle name
I'm not a saint
I've got no complaints:
There's a lot of worse things I ain't

I'm crackin' up
I'm crackin' up

People wanna put their tag on you
Define what you do
And you might enjoy some small renown
But it's hard to live down
Stuck in a mould
Do what you're told
A product that's bought and sold
Made out of straw
Sentenced before
The Court Of Unwritten Law

I'm crackin' up
I'm crackin' up
I won't stand for it so I am
Crackin' up
I've got no time for it so I am
Crackin' up

Though I hide behind a cool facade
I can't drop my guard
Almost made myself a nervous wreck
Keeping feelings in check
You've gotta perform
Stick to the norm
Wishing you were never born
You've gotta behave
Facing looking brave
And you'll dig yourself an early grave

I recall a schoolboy coming home
Through fields of cane
To a house of tin and timber
And in the sky
A rain of falling cinders
From time to time
The waste memory-wastes

I recall a boy in bigger pants
Like everyone
Just waiting for a chance
His father's watch
He left it in the showers
From time to time
The waste memory-wastes

I recall a bigger brighter world
A world of books
And silent times in thought
And then the railroad
The railroad takes him home
Through fields of cattle
Through fields of cane
From time to time
The waste memory-wastes
The waste memory-wastes

I recall the same, a reply
A plan you once had
From time down to mind
That time was bad, so I knew where I was
Alone, and so at home

[Outro: Grant McLennan]
Further, longer, higher, older
Mother and child playing on the lawn
It's a middle class home on a Sunday morning
And the mother says, son, where ya gonna run
Where ya gonna run to now?

I just jumped bail on a dope bust mum
And I'm saying goodbye and then the drug squad come
And in the name of the law
They punch him in the jaw
Where ya gonna run to now?

A long white car out of Tullamarine
A government member to the Carribean
And a man with a broom
Yells across the room
Where ya gonna run to now?

Will you have to tell lies when the kids ask you why
The horizon's a blanket of gloom
When the battle lines draw
Which way will you turn

Terania Creek's got a dozer track
And we'll never ever get Lake Pedder back
A director and a graph
And a million dollar laugh
Where ya gonna run to now?

Enrich the oxide out of Port Pirie
And the toxic gases they won't even see
But where ya gonna go
When the North wind blows
Where ya gonna run to now?

And your loungeroom is screening Nationwide
And you've just given blood to the bank
And the books on your shelves
Are a measure of all that you've earned
Will you have to tell lies when the kids ask you why
The horizon's a blanket of gloom
When the battle lines draw
Which way will you turn

Shake me, wake me, tell me it's a dream
I've got a B-52 on my TV screen
And a man in a tie
Pointing to the sky
Where ya gonna run to now

Mother and child playing on the lawn
It's a middle class home on a Sunday morning
And the mother says, son, where ya gonna run
Where ya gonna run to now?
I'm a ringer from the top end where ya gotta know your job
And what you're doin' each day on 2 million acres you bet
Ya have to earn your pay if ya wanna take it on
There's one thing that shouldn't be forgotten
Nobody else can do the job like a ringer from the top end
Out on the fence line swallowing dust, blood on my hands from the barb
Hoping that rogue bull won't see the hole before they get him in the yard
But I get a funny feeling in the middle of my back
Sure enough he's coming like a train down the track
That's when nobody else moves faster than the ringer from the top end
Instrumental
I'm a ringer from the top end
Where ya gotta muster 3 thousand head in a day
Move 'em to the yards and water them at end of day
It's not the sort of job you'd take if you're looking for a soft one
But ya take a kinda pride in saying, "I'm a ringer from the top end."
Well I roll out my swag 'neath the boab tree
And then I'm out like a light dreaming about those girls in town
Next thing it's broad daylight no time to dream of what might have been
I'm in a dirty bull catcher with the mustering team
I better keep my mind on the job 'cause I'm a ringer from the top end. Hey!
And nobody does the job better than a ringer from the top end. Oh Yeah!
Heavy heart think of yesterday
And you're torn apart
Thinking of the ways it was easier to smile
More than today love grew wild
Heavy heart like a perfect stranger
You make it hard
Taking all the blame - still you hear the sound
Calling your name - troubles coming down
Too heavy

Turn it around
It's pressing me down
Heavy heart
This time I find
It weighs on my mind
Heavy heart

It's just like you to take it all so far
Then you feel abused and wonder who you are
Everything you've done - anything you start
Can turn and run
Ain't it true - it's only just a stage
Gotta give it room - start an empty page
Get back in the game - but do it your way
You don't have to play so heavy

Turn it around
It's pressing me down
Heavy heart
This time I find
It weighs on my mind
Heavy heart

When your heart is strong it leads you on
But when it breaks you
It devastates you for so long
Turn it around
It's pressing me down
Heavy heart
This time I find
It weighs on my mind
Heavy heart

Turn it around
It's pressing me down
Heavy heart
This time I find
It weighs on my mind
Heavy heart

Just a short note
You'll find the key inside
There's no one home tonight
But come in anyway
The shallow-ow sea
Calm, but not asleep
You're gonna wade into the dee-yay-ayp
Tomorrow's years away
And now I-I know
Why darkness makes me smile
The night will have it's child
And the wind will wind away
The wind will wind away-yay-ay
Until you're telling your friends we-ee died
Laughing still (laughing still)
But the vessel that you-ou fill
Will be your own
Wade into the deep
How much can you see, yay-ay
Before we're all the same
Those words I wrote
I see my errors now
There's too much when and how
And you blow it anyway
The shallow-ow sea
Calm, but not asleep
You're goin' to wade into the dee-yay-ayp
Tomorrow's years away
Every day, every day, every day
And now I know
Why darkness makes me smile
The night will have it's child
And we'll all just blow away
Just watch us blow away-yay-ay
Until you're telling your friends we-ee died
Laughing still
But the vessel that you-ou fill
Will be your ow-ow-wo-own
Wade into the deep
How much can you see-yay
Before we're all the sa-ame
Show me
I'd like to believe that you love me
I'd like to believe that you care
I'd like to believe your the one I can trust
Your the one who will always be there
I'd like to believe in the future
I wish it was safe and strong
I wish I could fly on a wing and a prayer
But I've lied to myself for too long

Tell me where do you go?
Tell me when I'm not around
Theres a place I know
You can let your defences down
Oh come on

I'd like to same damn the torpedos
I'd like to same damn the expense
I'd like to say no, to the cold hard cash
But starving just would not make sense
I wish I could scream like a baby
I wish I could cry out and be saved
I wish I was grateful and my conscience was clear
So then I could dance on you grave.

So tell me where do you go?
Tell me when I'm not around
theres a place I know
You can let your defences down
Oh yeah let 'em down

Where do you go?
Tell me when I'm not around
theres a place I know
You can let your defenses down

Where do you go?
Tell me when I'm not around
theres a place I know
You can let your defenses down

I shouldn't have driven
You shouldn't have driven - but we got there
Had a good time, so we left the car
And the cabby was from a war-zone
We were glad he was driving us home
I was gladder of some movement
You took it on, you took it on board
I said "Thank you, thank you, for loving me at my worst"

If this isn't love it's very close
Can you hear the world is waking up?
Can we be crazy for a few more years?
Have I got them in me?

Bought myself one of those keyboard axes
Wanted to get out and dance away from the piano
That could have been the beginning of the end
If I wasn't already in the middle
The crowd was confused - and then they cheered
My career it was back on track
I was relieved, full of love for the people
I said "Thank you, each and every one of you
For loving me at my worst"

If this isn't love it's very close
Can you hear the world is waking up?
Can we be crazy for a few more years?
Have I got them in me?

All you bright and middle-aged things
Attending your sons and daughters
Spare a thought for me out here with the kids
To hell with your bricks and mortar

It's you and me and the Holy Ghost
On the road to dawn heading down the coast
We're better sorry than safe when you count the cost
Mmm sorry than safe when you count the cost

There's a bar out east called Scrum
Only red wine and the finest of cigars
And if we leave now we'll still get in
You can find yourself a young consort
Writers of unpopular fiction are trying to drink more
Than bikies who've all left their beards at the door
You'll drink all the wine and smoke your cigar
And say "Thank you, thank you, for loving me at my worst"

If this isn't love it's very close
Can you hear the world is waking up?
Can we be crazy for a few more years?
Have I got them in me?

Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away

When the war is over
Got to get away
Pack my bag to no place
In no time no day
You and I we used each other's shoulder
Still so young but somehow so much older
How can I go home and not get
Blown away

You and I had our sights set
On something
Hope this doesn't mean our days are numbered
I got plans for more than a wanted man
All around this chaos and madness
Can't help feeling nothing more than sadness
Only choice to face it the best I can

When the war is over
Got to start again
Try to hold a trace of what it was
Back then
You and I we sent each other stories
Just a page I'm lost in all its glory
How can I go home and not get blown away

Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away

Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
Your kiss can leave me cold
I miss the fire that our hearts used to hold
Oh, oh, there's no danger anymore
Oh, oh, you're not a stranger anymore

And I'm out that door (out that door)
I'm out that door (if you call)
But I'm not sure
When we decided not to care for each other anymore

By rights we should be friends
My pride was hurt, but is that so hard to mend?
Oh, oh, I've been trying not to phone
Oh, oh, I've gotta know if you're alone

And I'm out that door (out that door)
If you'll just call (if you call)
And day or night (night and day)
Anytime at all (if you call)
But should I wait? (should I wait?)
We're always breaking up, and making up so much better than before

Your touch is my unknown
So much to learn
So little time to know
Oh, oh, we're not strangers anymore

Out that door (out that door)
Into the light (in the light)
We'll face the world (out that door)
Just you and I (you and I)
We'll breathe the air (out that door)
That freedom brings (freedom brings)
We'll sing the song (out that door)
Freedom sings (freedom sings)

I look in your eyes, and it's understood
I look in your eyes, and it's understood
I look in your eyes, and it's understood
I look in your eyes, and it's understood
I will not go quietly
I will not accept your rules
Gonna live with myself
Before I live with any of you

I will not go quietly
I will not behave myself
It's not for sake of fighting
It's not for you or anyone else
And I was the best, you all knew it
On the days I cared at all
You can all say I blew it, you'll be talking bout me for years

I was my own man
Can ya'll say that?
I was my own man
Can ya'll say that?
I was my own man, yeah I was the shit

I don't believe in Bondi
Don't believe in rugby league
I believe in Yoko, John Lennon, last weekend and me

Well I was the best you all knew it
On the days I cared at all
Now you can all say I blew it, you'll be talking bout me for years

I was my own man
Can ya'll say that?
I was my own man
Can ya'll say that?
I was my own man, yeah I was the shit

I will not go quietly
I will not go quietly
I will not accept your rules
I don't believe in Bondi
Don't believe in rugby league
I will not go quietly (repeat till fade)

It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter, anyhow
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right

It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right

It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Like you never did before
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, gal
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right
We can boogie on down, down, down, down
We can boogie on down, down, down, down

Let's groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby, slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight

Let this groove get you to move
It's all right, all right
Let this groove set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

Gonna tell you what you can do
With my love, all right
Let you know girl you're looking good
You're outta sight, all right

Just move yourself and
You glide like a 747
And you lose yourself
In the sky among the clouds in the heavens 'cause

Let this groove, light up your fuse
It's all right, all right
Let this groove, set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

Let this groove get you to move
It's all right, all right
Let this groove set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

Let me tell you what you can do
With my love, all right
Gotta let you know girl you're looking good
You're outta sight, all right

Just tell the DJ to play your favorite tune
Then you know it's okay
What you found is happening now

Let this groove light up the fuse
It's all right, all right
Let this groove set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

Let this groove get you to move
It's all right, all right
Let this groove set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

You will find peace of mind on the floor
Take a little time, come and see, you with me
Make a little sign, I'll be there after a while
If you want my love
We can boogie on down, down, down, down

Let's groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby, slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight

Let this groove light up the fuse
It's all right, all right
Let this groove set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

Let this groove get you to move
It's all right, all right
Let this groove set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

Just move yourself
Just move yourself
My first customer was Megan
She came in for a hamburger with the lot - no meat
Hey that's a salad roll I said and we started going out

My second customer was Susan
She came in for Diet Pepsi morning tea
Each day and I said You don't need to be on a diet
Do you wanna come out tonight?

I said I'll bring Gringo he's got a lot of money
And he'll take us to the bars where they've got a view
He'll buy us all those beers they give it to you in bottles
They put lemon in the top it don't taste too bad I'm telling you

My third customer was Maria she came in for hot chips and sauce
More sauce she said. I said now you're talking
And she took me home to meet her mother

My fourth customer was Sandy she came in for nothing I could see except me
So it was I too, was eating a hamburger of sorts within an hour

I make hamburgers I get all the girls
And I take 'em out to dinner and I give 'em all a whirl
And If they work I keep 'em If they don't I keep 'em too
But I teach 'em all how to be dirty girls like you

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing 
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing 
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody, I used to know
(Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody, I used to know
(Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know
I used to know, that I used to know, I used to know somebody
We run together but so much is left unsaid
I'm right beside you but I can't tell what's in your head
I made a promise but you keep me hangin' on
So far to travel but my heart it ain't that strong

Can I call you from the edge of nowhere?
Can I reach you if I call from the other side?
Would you throw me a line 'cross the banks of a broken river?
Would you save me if I threw myself into the raging tide?

There's so much I could say but I can't tell you why
We got to walk to the water when I know that we could fly
Away from here but the path is oh so long
Longer than the time that it takes to get back home

Can I call you from the edge of nowhere?
Can I reach you if I call from the other side?
Would you throw me a line 'cross the banks of a broken river?
Would you save me if I threw myself into the raging tide?

On a crowded beach in a distant time
At the height of summer, see a boy of five
At the water's edge so nimble and free
Jumping over the ripples, looking way out to sea

Now a man comes up from amongst the throng
Takes the young boy's hand and his hand is strong
And the child feels safe, yeah, the child feels brave
As he's carried in those arms up and over the waves

Let's move forward now and the child's seventeen
With a girl in the back seat tugging at his jeans
And she knows what she wants, she guides with her hand
As a voice cries inside him - "I'm a man, I'm a man!"

Now the man meets a woman unlike all the rest
Well, he doesn't know it yet but he's out of his depth
And he thinks he can run, it's a matter of pride
But he keeps coming back like a cork on the tide

Well, the years hurry by and the woman loves the man
Then one night in the dark she grabs hold of his hand
Says "There, can you feel it kicking inside?!"
And the man gets a shiver right up and down his spine

Is calling him on...

So the clock moves around and the child is a joy
But Death doesn't care just who it destroys
Now the woman gets sick, thins down to the bone
She says "Where I'm going next, I'm going alone"

On a distant beach lonely and wild
At a later time see a man and a child
And the man takes the child up into his arms
Takes her over the breakers, to where the water is calm

I had a dream
I saw you walking down the road
In a gatherning storm
Wind on the rise
A black crow was flying
You along in a gathering storm
I wake up along in my bed
There's nothing before my eyes
And outside the door
Only the sighing
And you out there in a gathering storm
So cover you head
Keep your eyes open
Make speed in the gathering storm
I rise up and turn on the light
Now it's shining inmy window
My walls are strong
My chimney's smoking
God speed you in the gathering storm
I'm tired of the city life
Summer's on the run
People tell me I should stay
But I got to get my fun
So don't try to hold me back
Ain't nothing you can say
Snake eyes on the paradise
And we got to go today

Take me to the April Sun in Cuba, oh, oh, oh
Take me where the April sun gonna treat me so right
So right
So right

I can almost smell the perfumed nighs
And see the starry sky
I wish you comin' with me baby
'Cause right before my eye
See Castro in the alley way
Talkin' 'bout missile love
Talkin' 'bout J.F.K.
And the way he shook him up

Take me to the April Sun in Cuba, oh, oh, oh
Take me where the April sun gonna treat me So right
so right
So right

I'm tired of the city life
Summer's on the run
Birds in the winter sky
Are headin' for the sun
Oh, we can stick it out
In this cold and grey
Snake eyes on the paradise
And we got to go today, yeah

Take me to the April Sun in Cuba, oh, oh, oh
Take me where the April sun gonna treat me so right
So right
So right

Take me to the April sun
As I went a walking on Kilgary Mountain
I spied Colonel Pepper and his money he was countin'
I rattled out my pistols and I drew forth my saber
Cryin' Stand and deliver for I am a bold deceiver

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy o
Whack for my daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar

The gold and silver coins they looked so bright and shiny
Oh I took them home straightway and I gave 'em to my Molly
She vowed and she promised that she never would deceive me
But the devil's in the women oh you never can believe 'em

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy o
Whack for my daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar

But when I awoke between six and seven
The guards were all around me in numbers odd and even
I reached for my pistols but alas I was mistaken
My pistols had been fired and a prisoner I was taken

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy o
Whack for my daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar

They put me in the jail without judge or writin'
For robbing Colonel Pepper oh on Kilgary Mountain
But they didn't take my fists so I knocked the sentry down
And bade farewell to the jail in Sligo town

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy o
Whack for my daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar

Some people take delight in fishin' and in bowlin'
Oh others take delight in the carriages a rollin'
But I take delight in the juice of the barley
And courtin' pretty girls 'til the morning so early

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy o
Whack for my daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy o
Whack for my daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar
My name is John Johanna, I am misunderstood
Lately, I have been accused of grievous murder in cold blood
My mission is most righteous, my cause is true and just
The wicked need chastisement, you know it?s either them or us

God told me to
I did what I had to do
'Cuz God told me to

All around me, empty chatter, the wise men wring their hands
Meanwhile in broad daylight Satan gathers his unholy bands
The mighty strength of angels carries me on my seeking flight
My anger is a hammer, you know not its power or the hour it strikes

God told me to
I answer not to them or you
'Cuz God told me to

Seven golden candles flaming bring forth the Son of Man
In his mouth a two edged sword, seven stars shining in his right hand
The beast has eyes before him, the beast has eyes behind
Those not with me are against me, they?re surely gonna feel my holy fire

God told me to
To thine own self be true
And God told me to

God told me to
I?m just doing what I had to do
'Cuz God told me to
And God told me to

Hey, does it ever make you wonder what's on my mind
I was only ever running back to your side
I never cried, I just watched my life go by
It's just a pack of lies, cos you're leaving me behind

Why, after this long is there nothing I'll keep
Oh I can shout, you'll pretend you're asleep
I live a lie, yeah, believing that you're mine
It's just a waste of time, cos you're leaving me behind

Hey, there's not a cloud in the sky
It's as blue as your goodbye
And I thought that it would rain
On a day like today...

Hey there's not a cloud in sight
It's as blue as your blue goodbye
And I thought that it would rain
The day you went away...

Hey does it ever make you wonder what's on my mind
Oooo, oooh, I was only ever running back to your side

(Repeat Chorus)
He's on the buses and the aeroplanes
With some groceries and a sleeping bag
When I spend a week at home I just sit around and moan
It’s a cobweb that we call suburban load
Then I know it’s time to leave, I got freedom up my sleeve
And my mates are out there on the long black road
When the pressures of the town start to grind you down
And you feel your very soul set to explode
And the troubles and the strife that surrounds you in this life
You leave behind out on the long black road
You can have your city mansions swimming pools and gardens big
Australia is my playground and my mansion this old rig
It’s the kind of life we choose and become addicted to
Yeah lovin’ livin’ drivin’ this old rig
Fiddle/ Pedal Steel Solo
One week we’re in the north, and another way down south
From east to west they need an urgent load
Then you’re rollin’ once again cross the big old Nullarbor plain
It’s a lifetime rollin’ down the long black road
When the dust is flyin’ high out beneath the southern sky
It’s the best darn way of life you come across
And your home from home’s just fine this old black rig of mine
The rig they call the flyin’ southern cross
Yeah you can have your city mansions swimming pools and gardens big
Australia is my playground and my mansion this old rig
It’s the kind of life we choose and become addicted to, hey
Yeah lovin’ livin’ drivin’ this old rig
One week we’re in the north, and another way down south
From east to west they need an urgent load
Then you’re rollin’ once again cross the big old Nullarbor plain
It’s a lifetime rollin’ down the long black road
It’s a lifetime rollin’ down the long black road
Hey a lifetime rollin’ down the long black road

Got myself into some trouble tonight
Guess I'm just feelin' blue
It's been so long
Since I've seen your face
This distance between me and you
That voice you showed me is not the one that I know
I must be strong now, in what I do
Don't hang up again
There's nothing else I know how to do

But I burn for you
What am I gonna do
Burn for you

I guess it feels like you're always alone
And I feel that way too
It's so hard to explain to you
Please understand what I do

I burn for you
What am I gonna do
I burn for you
Burn for you

Took my trouble to a bar tonight
For another point of view
But there's nothing new
I'm missing you

I burn for you
What am I gonna do
Burn for you
Burn for you

I burn for you
What am I gonna do
I burn for you

Burn for you
What am I gonna do
I burn for you
Burn for you

Burn
For
You

Go!!

So 1,2,3, take my hand and come with me
because you look so fine 
and I really wanna make you mine.

I say you look so fine 
that I really wanna make you mine.

Oh, 4,5,6, c'mon and get your kicks

Big black boots, 
long brown hair, 
she's so sweet

But you were with another man, yea!

Well, so 1,2,3, take my hand and come with me

and I really wanna make you mine.

I say you look so fine 
that I really wanna make you mine.

Oh, 4,5,6, c'mon and get your kicks 
now you don't need that money

Big black boots,

Uh, be my girl.
Be my girl.
Are you gonna be my girl?! Yeah
Everyone talks so fast and walks so slow
Suddenly in a town they don't know
Last stop and strangers drink
And admitting me in the midnight show and
Two kids sweat
As he's trying to get his lips to her neck
It's all up to him, it's a concession film
But what do you do?
Where have I been lately?
Dirty water interrupted by
A bridge that's not too sore on the eye
Guy in the better looking pants
Is ruining the other's night and
Will he hurt
As the air conditioning draws out the shirt
It's all up to him, it's a concession film
But what do you do?
Where have I been lately?

It's if nothing I said knows new
It's if you've never heard anything true
But we will try 'til the next time or the last time

Everyone talks so fast and walks so slow
Suddenly in a town they don't know
Hours come and minutes fly
The fifteen stories window high and
Two kids sweet
As he tries to stare his shame to his feet
'cause you owe it to him, it's a concession film
But what do you do?
Where have I been lately?

It's if nothing I said knows new
It's if you've never heard anything true
But we will try 'til the next time or the last time
In the mist
Of my endless search
The best in life
Becomes clear

The rest just begins
To fade by itself
That's a trick I learnt
Though it took so long 

Bitter tears taste so sweet
I'm seeing my way
For the first time in years 

When the love around
Begins to suffer
And you can't find love
In one
In one another
Push away those bitter tears
Bitter tears 

And I thought I was
Doing no wrong
And I thought I was doing no wrong 

In the hour
Of your needs
Lips are trembling
Cause you're gonna be free
Realise what we're doing here
The time is right to kill your fears 

Bitter tears taste so sweet
I'm seeing my way
For the first time in years 

When the love around
Begins to suffer
And you can't find love
In one
In one another
Push away those bitter tears
Bitter tears 

And I thought I was doing no wrong 

Push away those bitter tears 

That's what they call doing no wrong
That's what they call doing no wrong 

Push away those bitter tears
Push away those bitter tears
Push away those bitter tears 

Went down to Santa Fe
Where Renoir paints the walls
Described you clearly
But the sky began to fall

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Trams, cars and taxis
Little waxworks on the move
Carry young girls past me
But none of them are you

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Without you near me
I got no place to go
Wait at the bar
Maybe you might show

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

I've got to stop these tears
That's falling from my eye
Go walk out in the rain
So no one sees me cry

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Can't stop the memory
That goes climbing through my brain
I get no answers
So the questions still remains

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again
I know all the lines to say
The part I'm expected to play
But in the reflection I am worlds away

As I put my costume on
Eyelashes one by one
Been doing this so long I can tie the knot
Behind my back

And everyone's waiting
But it's getting harder to hear what my heart is saying
Cos everyone's waiting

Just swallow and breathe, she says
Remember this ain't for you it's for them
And all of those painful lessons you've had to learn
You gotta use them now or never

Cos everyone's waiting
But it's getting harder to hear what my heart keeps saying
Turn it off, I wanna turn it all off

When everyone's waiting
It makes it harder to hear what my heart keeps saying
Turn it off, I wanna turn it all off

But everyone's waiting
I hear that answers appear when you just stand still
But make it all, how do you make it all stop
When everyone's waiting
Everyone's waiting
Somewhere on a South Pacific island
Sits a young man staring at the surf
His native girlfriend died a death quite violent
In a tribal sacrifice made to the Earth

She was brown, her hair was black, her eyes were blue
A chief's daughter, Leilani was her name
She and her young man made a handsome two
But lava tore them both apart again

He'd say, Leilani, don't go to the volcano
He'd say, please don't go to the volcano

They were saving for a little hut
She collected sea shells every day
And every night they'd share a cigarette
But the ancient, angry gods got in the way

He'd say, Leilani, don't go to the volcano
He would plead, please don't go, I'll miss you so

Katoomba hey! Macumbah ho! Umgawah!
Katoomba hey! Macumbah ho! Umgawah!
Katoomba hey! Macumbah ho! Umgawah!
Hey! Ho! Hey-eh!
Hey! Ho! Hey-eh! Ah
Leilani crula-bula-ulladulla-wok-a-tai
Aba-laba-laba Hut! Aba-laba-laba Hut!
Leilani nevageta-huta-tera-cota-tile
Aba-laba-laba Hut! Aba-laba-laba Hut!
Umgawah!!!
Hey! Ho! Hey-eh!
Hey! Ho! Hey-eh!
Hey! Ho! Hey-eh!
Ah Ah

Still the young man sits there on the beach
He's staring misty-eyed out into space
He's thinking about his girlfriend, the late deceased
At least her death had purpose, his life is a waste

And his life is a waste
Please don't go, I love you, I love you, I love you so

She said she wants to be wed
She chose a mountain god instead

Now listen, Leilani, I can't stand this carrying on around
Better come on down from that mound
You know that ain't no sacred ground
Listen, please!
Oh oh, oh oh
She's gone, gone, gone, gone

Wake-waka-waka-wake.... Unh!
There's a corrugated highway Leading north from Port Augusta
Lined with ratted cars that didn't rate a tow
The Salt plains out of Pimba And your eyes begin to stream
On to Kingoonya huddled dusty by the road
Romantic notions shattered Like the tyres that didn't hack it
This has got to be the country's last frontier
Where a sports car's next to useless Running cattle grids and river beds
We drove a van from 1963

Someone mentioned walkabout And kiss your job goodbye
Just to see the country shimmer through the windscreen
Drinking beer, telling stories While laughter filled the night
And flexi-time's behind you like a bad dream

You got a flat on ANZAC Highway And Lawson on your shelf
Its a Southern Comfort, air-conditioned rage
Where a homestead's more than just a cheap print Dangling from a wall

And mateship's more than lines upon a page

We went looking for Australia In between the TV lines
'Cause the ABC just couldn't make it real
Colour documentary From a beanbag on the floor:
Never shows as much as it conceals

A stark and blistered Alice Springs And a river runs with shame
And you wipe the sheets of bulldust from your eyes
Another country's uniform And the mirage it falls apart
To the open gap between the truth and lies

Go and see your country, mate The travel agents scream
Politicians sell it's heart just for a past-time
Signs and high-wire fences Hold the land where I belong
It's as if I'm in the outback for the last time

Well I know things haven't been
Working out too well lately
I want too many dreams
To drown in your wishing well

And I heard you crying in the chapel
On this great big happy sunny day
And I know I live in a jungle
Somethings never change

I believed for much too long
Friday night ball and chain
And even if our colours fade
I know now

And I heard you crying in the chapel
On this great big happy sunny day
And I know I live in the jungle
Somethings never change

Oooohhh yeah
Mmmm mmm mmm ya

Well I know things haven't been
Working out too well lately
I want too many dreams
To drown in your wishing well

And I heard you crying in the chapel
On this great big happy sunny day
And I know I live in the jungle
Somethings never change

I heard you crying in the chapel
On this great big sunny day
I know I heard you in the chapel
Somethings never change

I heard you crying in the chapel
On this great big sunny day
I know I heard you in the chapel
Somethings never change (fade)

We don't serve your country
Don't serve your king
Know your custom don't speak your tongue
White man came took everyone

We don't server your country
Don't serve your king
White man listen to the songs we sing
White man came took everything

We carry in our hearts the true country
And that cannot be stolen
We follow in the steps of our ancestry
And that cannot be broken

We don't serve your country
Don't serve your king
Know your custom don't speak your tongue
White man came took everyone

We don't need protection
Don't need your hand
Keep your promise on where we stand
We will listen we'll understand

We carry in our hearts the true country
And that cannot be stolen
We follow in the steps of our ancestry
And that cannot be broken

We carry in our hearts the true country
And that cannot be stolen
We follow in the steps of our ancestry
And that cannot be broken

Mining companies, pastoral companies
Uranium companies
Collected companies
Got more right than people
Got more say than people
Forty thousand years can make a difference to the state
of things
The dead heart lives here

I'm giving up, this whole lie is on me
Call it out like a family

Instead I bide my time, get a ride
Until the rubber leaves the road

You said, don't lie, so I made the truth
Seemed like a lie to even you

Control your fear, its clear
That you do not know where you're going to

So don't you worry
You'll be my resolution
Characters of no illusion
You will be my resolution

One month down and it's in sight
Oh, I'm guaranteed to lose my mind
Its dangerous to speak and sigh
You might know what I'm trying to hide

From the cradle to quarter age
Oh, I bought the book, but didn't flip the page
Readiness is near we steer
Far away from the coming of days

So don't you worry
You'll be my resolution
Characters of no illusion
You will be my resolution

Turn around, put it down and see
That this is really the place to be
I'm not you, nor you me
But we're both moving steady

Well I thought nothing was wrong, nothing was right
I turned to you, but you were no where in sight
I left it too late, and maybe I hurt your pride
I should have thought of you, now you've changed your mind
And just like a well, your love has run dry
Loneliness was falling from the sky

I'm like a man with no heart, I just don't belong
I can't help it when your love is gone

Well I missed all the signs, never read between lines
And all I can say to you is that my love was blind
It's breaking my heart, knowing right from the start
You tried to reach for me, now we had to part
And just like a well, your love has run dry
Loneliness was falling from the sky

I'm like a man with no heart, I just don't belong
I can't help it when your love is gone
And it's all I can do to carry on
I can't help it when your love is gone

Well I'll tell you no lies, you've opened my eyes
Made me feel like a man again
You've walked out that door, and you left me alone
I broke down and I cried, cause I don't think I can make it alone

Ohh.... listen..... I would sail the deepest ocean
Just to be by your side again
And all I want, is for you to love me
Just say you love me again, again, again, again

I'm like a man with no heart, I just don't belong
I can't help it when your love is gone
And it's all I can do just to carry on
I can't help it when your love is gone

I'm like a man with no heart, I just don't belong
I can't help it when your love is gone
And it's all I can do just to carry on
I can't help it when your love is gone

I'm like a man with no heart, I just don't belong
I can't help it when your love is gone
And it's all I can do just to carry on
I can't help it when your love is gone

I can't help myself when your love is gone
Your love is gone
Hey there, Georgy girl
Swingin' down the street so fancy-free
Nobody you meet could ever see
The loneliness there
Inside you

Hey there, Georgy girl
Why do all the boys just pass you by?
Could it be you just don't try
Or is it the clothes you wear?

You're always window-shopping
But never stopping to buy
So, shed those dowdy feathers and fly
A little bit

Hey there, Georgy girl
There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And, oh, what a change there'd be
The world would see
A new Georgy girl

Hey there, Georgy girl
Dreamin' of the someone you could be
Life is a reality
You can't always run away

Don't be so scared of changing
And rearranging yourself
It's time for jumping down from the shelf
A little bit

Hey there, Georgy girl
There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And, oh, what a change there'd be
The world would see
A new Georgy girl

(Hey there, Georgy girl)
Wake up, Georgy girl
(Hey there, Georgy girl)
Come on, Georgy girl
(Hey there, Georgy girl)
Wake up, Georgy girl
(Hey there, Georgy girl)
Come on, Georgy girl

When you’re sad and when you’re lonely
And you haven’t got a friend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all that you’ve held sacred
Falls down and does not mend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

When you’re standing at the crossroads
That you cannot comprehend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all your dreams have vanished
And you don’t know what’s up the bend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

When the storm clouds gather ’round you
And heavy rains descend
Just remember that death is not the end
And there’s no one there to comfort you
With a helping hand to lend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

Oh, the tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies
And the bright light of salvation shines
In dark and empty skies

When the cities are on fire
With the burning flesh of men
Just remember that death is not the end
And you search in vain to find
Just one law-abiding citizen
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
In the heat of the day down in Mobil Alabama
I was working on the railroad with a steel drivin' hammer
Trying to get some money buy a pair of new shoes
Trying to get a woman chase away my blues
Hot head wasted all sweating in the son
I won't see a woman till my work is all done

Maybe in the evening when the sun is sinking low
I'll be out waiting for my whistle to blow
Sitting in my teepee smoking out on the track
Jiving and singing till my foreman gets back
Suddenly I hear the brakeman up and shout
"There's a non stop train comin' two miles out"

Everybody's jumping and spinnin around
Trying to get a line and get the teepee down
Railroad owners 'bout to go insane
Trying to get the workers out of the way of the train
Here comes the engineer honkity honk
He's got a train he's gotta let it roll let it rock

I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie

I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream

And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose

And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you
But I know I gotta give it a try

And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game

But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it
Making love out nothing at all

(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love)
Out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all

Every time I see you all the rays of the sun are all
Streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes
Like a spotlight

The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright

I've gotta follow it cause everything I know
Well it's nothing till I give it to you

I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock

I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone

But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really wanna see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all

(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love)
Out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love, love)

Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love, love)

Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love, love, love)

You never expect it to be in your wildest dreams
So take a step backwards for a little while
You'll find it there
It's something that I can't explain
So I remain trapped inside
Still holding strong
Still holding on to you, to you

Take me back to you, it's been a long time
Although woh every night I think of you
It's such a lonely life

I watched you wave goodbye as you drove away
I didn't know that it would be your last time with me
You said - life ain't worth living if nobody cared
You said that all the time, oh
I take a step back and see your staring eyes
I see you on the day you died

Take me back to you, it's been a long time
Although woh every night I think of you
It's such a lonely life
Take me back to you, take me back to you

Take me back to you, it's been a long time
Although woh every night I think of you
It's such a lonely life, oh oh
Take me back to you, take me back to you

I've been pumping on the jack
All my lonely days are stacked
Now I'm heading straight for you

I've been working on the wire
I've been putting out these fires
Now I'm heading straight for you

Oh, my angel
I'm carrying the can
Oh, my angel
You're pouring petrol on a burning man

I've been changing dirty oil
Now my rags are really soiled
And I'm heading straight for you

I've been laying it too thick
I've been cleaning up the slick
Now I'm heading straight for you

Ev-ery night above my bed
Ev-ery night inside my head
I'm heading straight for you

[Outro]
Oh, my angel
I'm carrying the can
Oh, my angel
I'm carrying the can
Oh, my angel
You're pouring petrol on a burning man
Burning man
Burning man
Burning man...
Gotta make a move to a
town that's right for me
Town to keep me movin'
Keep me groovin' with some energy

Well, I talk about it
Talk about it
Talk about it
Talk about it
Talk about, Talk about
Talk about movin

Gotta move on
Gotta move on
Gotta move on

Won't you take me to
Funkytown
Won't you take me to
Funkytown
Won't you take me to
Funkytown
Won't you take me to
Funkytown

Gotta make a move to a
town that's right for me
Town to keep me movin'
Keep me groovin' with some energy

Well, I talk about it
Talk about it
Talk about it
Talk about it
Talk about, Talk about
Talk about movin

Gotta move on
Gotta move on
Gotta move on

Won't you take me to
Funkytown
Won't you take me to
Funkytown
Won't you take me to
Funkytown
Won't you take me to
Funkytown
Well you know just what you do to me
The way you move soft and slippery
Cut the night just like a razor
Rarely talk and that's the danger 

It's the one thing
You are my thing 

You know you voice is a love song
It's a cat call from the past
There's no ice in your lovers walk
You don't look twice cause you move so fast 

It's the one thing
You are my thing 

You've got a dozen men behind you
You've got dead flowers on the floor
You're too pretty in the daylight
It keeps them coming back for more
(Because you know I love you) 

It's the one thing
You are my thing 

It's the one thing
You are my thing 

It's the one thing
You are my thing

The video game says "play me"
Face it on a level but it takes you every time on a one on one
Feeling running down your spine 
Nothing gonna save your one last dime 'cause it own you
Through and through

The databank know my number
Says I gotta pay 'cause I made the grade last year
Feel it when I turn the screw
Kicks you round the world, there ain't a thing that it can't do
Do to you

Who made who, who made you?
Who made who, ain't nobody told you?
Who made who, who made you? 
If you made them and they made you 
Who picked up the bill, and who made who? 
Yeah
Who made who
Who turned the screw?

Yeah, satellites send me picture
Get it in the eye, take it to the wire
Spinning like a dynamo
Feel it going round and round
Running out of chips, you got no line in an eight  bit town
So don't look down, no

Who made who, who made you?
Who made who, ain't nobody told you?
Who made who, who made you? 
If you made them and they made you 
Who picked up the bill, and who made who? 
Ain't nobody told you
Oh who made who?
Who made you?
Who made who (who made who)
And who made who (who made who)
Yeah
Nobody told you
Hang me for a sucker On the plains out of Narrabri Swingin' a hoe in a CAL-cotton row Sweatin' on the dangers to me Bossman's Mr. Tucker He's a man I don't care to defy And his only child wicked and wild is seeking my company She wanna build me up tear me down Slap my knee bones to the ground Me and mine are gonna be around
When Tuckers' daughter's a memory Hot sun is a killer She'll be waitin' at the end of my line Taking the shade with a cool lemonade sayin' Boy I wanna talka to you Bossmans' only daughter She ain't his and she'll never be mine
Never be down on a dollar or two Or told what she's gonna do She wanna build me up tear me down Slap my knee bones to the ground Me and mine are gonna be around When Tuckers' daughters a memory Build me up tear me down I won't kneel 'til the trumpet sounds And Tuckers' daughter's a memory People born with all they need They don't understand Everything you want don't come from holding out your hand Tuckers' daughter thinks she sees A slave at her command I know you need some time yet baby But when the time is right Babe I just ain't your man
If I don't come home before midnight
And I call out your name in the dark
You'll know that I've been tempted
And I'll know that I've got no heart

And I'll know I won't be expected
And you'll think we're drifting apart
And I might as well be blowing at the top of the world
When my fingers find your body in the dark

Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire

So if I don't come home before midnight
And I can't find the keyhole in the dark
Burn the place down, make it glow like Christmas
The tenderness that's burning in my heart

Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire
[repeat]

If you can't open your eyes in the morning
If some maniac has been and left his mark
I'll be round to sift through the cinders
Lift the lid and take the thing apart

Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire
[repeat]

So to all you feelers and fumblers
Waiting for the fireworks to start
Do it now-blow it up yourself
Unbutton the butcher in your heart

And if I don't come home before midnight
And I can't find the keyhole in the dark
You'll know, you'll know that I've been tempted
You'll know, you'll know we're drifting apart

Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire
[repeat]

I'm saying all the things that I know you'll like, makin' good conversation
I gotta handle you just right, you know what I mean
I took you to an intimate restaurant, then to a suggestive movie
There's nothin' left to talk about, unless it's horizontally

Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk

repeat CHORUS

I've been patient, I've been good, tried to keep my hands on the table
It's gettin' hard this holdin' back, you know what I mean
I'm sure you'll understand my point of view, we know each other mentally
You gotta know that you're bringin' out the animal in me

Oh, let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk

Let's get animal, animal, I wanna get animal, let's get into animal
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk

Let me hear your body talk
Let me hear your body talk
Wasting all that i desired
Would bring me down again
And i could keep it all inside
It's just about becoming

Now i'm under the sun
Won't anyone see that i'm alive
Through the days that will ride with me all through the night

I'll be braving the winters the best that i know
'cause nothings the same when you wait for something
I was alone 'till i thought it was better that way

Static draining in my eyes
It's all that i could see
And time would never sympathise
It's just enough to save me

Now i'm hoping to stay
Seconds away from all that i can be
Every time that i run from you and run from me...

Now i'm under the sun won't anyone see that i'm alive
Every time that i fall asleep and still survive...

Nothing follows me down again
Nothing follows me down again
Nothing follows me down again...
From a distant horizon she wanders my way
With so much to give and so little to say
She's a creature of silence, she's my imaginary girl

Well she spoke with her eyes they were filled with despair
Generations of sadness were burning in there
She's a dream I once had, she's my imaginary girl

Well I tried to possess her, I tried to hold on
I built wooden fences a thousand miles long
But she was too hot to handle, my imaginary girl

There were so many times I could name you a few
For me there was nothing that she wouldn't do
There were so many reasons to please, my imaginary girl

Like sweet inspiration she somes and she goes
With each passing hour the mystery grows
I will always be willing to meet, my imaginary girl

I'm an ordinary man, I'm as greedy as sin
I'm a fool for my senses, oh where to begin
To tell of the love that I feel, my imaginary girl

Now winter is here, there's a chill in the air
If I close my eyes I know she'll be there
I will always be willing to dream, my imaginary girl
Dream my imaginary girl
Hallucinate, desegregate
Mediate, alleviate
Try not to hate, love your mate
Don't suffocate on your own hate

Designate your love as fate
A one-world state as human freight
The number eight, a white/black state
A gentle trait, the broken crate
A heavyweight or just too late
Like pretty Kate has sex ornate

Now devastate, appreciate
Depreciate, fabricate
Emulate, a truth dilate
Special date, the animal we ate
Guilt debate, the edge serrate
A better rate, the youth irate
Deliberate, fascinate
Deviate, reinstate
Liberate, too moderate

Recreate or detonate
Annihilate atomic fate
Mediate, clear the slate
Activate and now radiate
A perfect state, a food on plate
Gravitate the Earth's own weight
Designate your love as fate
At ninety-eight we all rotate

Hallucinate, desegregate
Mediate, alleviate
Try not to hate, love your mate
Don't suffocate on your own hate

Designate your love as fate
A one-world state as human freight
The number eight, a white/black state
A gentle trait, the broken crate
A heavyweight or just too late
Like pretty Kate has sex ornate

Now devastate
Appreciate, depreciate, fabricate
Emulate, truth dilate
The special date, the animals we ate

Guilt debate, the edge serrate
A better rate, a youth irate
Deliberate, fascinate
Deviate and reinstate

And liberate
To liberate
To liberate
To liberate
I feel a little crazy
I feel a little strange
Like I'm in a pay phone
Without any change
I feel a little edgy
I feel a little weird
I feel like a schoolboy
Who's grown a beard

I'm livin' in the 70's
Eatin' fake food under plastic trees
My face gets dirty just walkin' around
I need another pill to calm me down

I feel a bit nervous
I feel a bit mad
I feel like a good time that's never been had
I feel a bit fragile
I feel a bit low
Like I learned the right lines
But I'm on the wrong show

I'm livin' in the 70's
I feel like I lost my keys
Got the right day but I got the wrong week
And I get paid for just bein' a freak

I feel a little insane
I feel a bit dazed
My legs are shrinkin'
And the roof's been raised
I feel a little mixed up
I feel a little queer
I feel like a barman that can't drink a beer

Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know there's
Just no getting over you

You know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But baby can't you see there's nothing left for me to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's no way to hide
Since you pushed my heart aside
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying fool forget him
My heart is saying don't let go
Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's no way to hide
Since you pushed my heart aside
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Though I speak in tongues of angels
And in many tongues of men
Though prophecy may sing through me
Without love I'm nothing

Though I understand all mysteries
And can see the story's end
Though my faith can move mountains
Without love I'm nothing

Love is the law, the law is love
Love is the law, the law is love

You may give away your riches
Do good deeds in the sight of men
You may be strong against temptation
But without love you're nothing

Without love you're jus useless
Without love you're living in hell
Without love you're so hollow
An empty horn, a clanging bell

Love is the law, the law is love
Love is the law, the law is love

Love can suffer hardship
Love is touch and kind
Love is never envious
Or puffed up with pride

Love is always truthful
Love is never stale
Love is always hopeful
And never dreams that it can fail

Love is the law, the law is love
Love is the law, the law is love
Pash between the lines honey read my lips
Can you read my mind take my fingertips
I really like to just hang around
Crawl back into bed where
It's nice and warm

Luck fell in my lap
When you walked my way
Part of your tender trap
Yes I'm willing prey
I really love to speak in tongue
Crawl into your mouth
That's where I belong
Passionate kisses
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Oo oo ooh 
Cause I'm on fire when you love me
Kiss me passionately
Pash me, pash me, pash me

Pash beneath the signs of a neon mail
Lost between the now
And the human sprawl
We really love to just hang around 
Even if there's nothing really happening
Passionate kisses
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Oo oo ooh
Cause I'm on fire when you love me
Kiss me passionately
Pash me, pash me, pash me
Oo oo ooh
Yes I'm on fire when you love me
Kiss me passionately
Pash me, pash me, pash me

Now I don't want to tame this illicit urge
There's this part of me
That's just got to splurge
I really like to just hang around 
Come back into bed babe 
Turn off the phone
Passionate kisses
Kiss me,Kiss me, kiss me
Oo oo ooh
Cause I'm on fire when you love me 
Kiss me passionately
Pash me, pash me, pash me x2
Are you so cold, lonely and old?
Are you in company? Could you talk to me?
Is it the least that I can do is when you leave to hold the door?

And at the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over, over?
At the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over?

And am I so sold, lonely and old?
Am I in company? Could you talk to me?
Is it the least that I can do is when you leave to hold the door?

And at the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over, over?
At the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over?

Or is it all in my imagination?

It's the end of my ride
It's a slow suicide
And it's over

Am I in company? Can't you talk to me?
Is it the least that I can do is when you leave to hold the door?

And at the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over, over?
At the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over, over?
And at the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over?

Or is it all in my imagination?

It's the end of my ride
It's a slow suicide
And it's over
Here I stand in the middle of the land
Take my hand in the middle of the land

You'll see something that's new in the sunshine
You'll be the winter that's turning to springtime

Here I stand in the middle of the land (in the middle of the land)
Take my hand in the middle of the land (in the middle of the land)

Someday someone will try to confuse you
And they'll say things you want to hear and they'll use you
I thought we'd live and learn
But some folks seem to yearn
For values unsophisticated
Those days are dead and gone
I won't wish them back upon
A world that's much more complicated, yeah

Here I stand in the middle of the land (in the middle of the land)
Take my hand in the middle of the land (in the middle of the land)
I said here I stand in the middle of the land (in the middle of the land)
You gotta take my hand, I'm always glad to hand (in the middle of the land)

They'll try to blind you with T.V. religion
Don't buy their hand-me-down second-opinions
Sometimes the biggest lies
Are most easily disguised
Dressed up like the road to glory
Then somewhere down the line
You will rub your eyes and find
You're on a path to your own purgatory, yeah

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah

You'll know something as old as the moonlight
You'll throw superstition and fear away tonight
They'll paint us black and white
They'll paint us wrong and right
They'll paint us all into a corner
They'll try to cool us down
But they could never fool us now
We're steamed up hotter than a Swedish sauna

Here I stand (in the middle of the land)
Take my, take my hand (your horizons will expand)
Land (in the middle, middle of the land)
Land (in the middle, middle of the land)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) in the middle of the land
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) in the middle, middle of the land
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) middle of the land
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) land on me
Gather round people let me tell you're a story
An eight year long story of power and pride
British Lord Vestey and Vincent Lingiarri
Were opposite men on opposite sides 

Vestey was fat with money and muscle
Beef was his business, broad was his door
Vincent was lean and spoke very little
He had no bank balance, hard dirt was his floor 

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow 

Gurindji were working for nothing but rations
Where once they had gathered the wealth of the land
Daily the pressure got tighter and tighter
Gurindju decided they must make a stand 

They picked up their swags and started off walking
At Wattie Creek they sat themselves down
Now it don't sound like much but it sure got tongues talking
Back at the homestead and then in the town 

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow 

Vestey man said I'll double your wages
Seven quid a week you'll have in your hand
Vincent said uhuh we're not talking about wages
We're sitting right here till we get our land
Vestey man roared and Vestey man thundered
You don't stand the chance of a cinder in snow
Vince said if we fall others are rising 

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow 

Then Vincent Lingiarri boarded an aeroplane
Landed in Sydney, big city of lights
And daily he went round softly speaking his story
To all kinds of men from all walks of life 

And Vincent sat down with big politicians
This affair they told him is a matter of state
Let us sort it out, your people are hungry
Vincent said no thanks, we know how to wait 

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow 

Then Vincent Lingiarri returned in an aeroplane
Back to his country once more to sit down
And he told his people let the stars keep on turning
We have friends in the south, in the cities and towns 

Eight years went by, eight long years of waiting
Till one day a tall stranger appeared in the land
And he came with lawyers and he came with great ceremony
And through Vincent's fingers poured a handful of sand 

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow 

That was the story of Vincent Lingairri
But this is the story of something much more
How power and privilege can not move a people
Who know where they stand and stand in the law 

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Money was a never ending object for you from the start
A Picture of your only loving sister
That you just fucked up

Too young to know
Too old to listen

You live your life inside a day dream
Your lovers pride worn like a costume
Too blind to see what you're missing

Well if you love yourself in the moring
Loosen up your little bow tie
You know you gave me an early warning
Early warning

Wall to wall mirrors in your bathroom
You can see yourself dressing with your back turned
You love your wife 'cause she's a challenge
You love your wife 'cause she's a challenge

Well if you love yourself in the moring
Loosen up your little bow tie
You know you gave me an early warning
Early warning

Too young to know, ha ha yeah
Too young, too old to listen

Say if you love yourself in the moring
Loosen up your little bow tie
You know you gave me an early warning
Early warning

Say if you love yourself in the moring
Loosen up your little bow tie
You know you gave me an early warning
Early warning

You know you gave me an early warning
You know you gave me an early warning

Aahh loosen up
[Intro]
Ooh...

I've been seen on the street
Wearing brand new clothes
I guess I've landed on my feet
I'm a lucky guy, I suppose
She tells me that she loves me
She buys me things
She wants to take care of me
And all I gotta do is sing, sing, sing, sing

Well, I look so fine but I feel so low
Yeah, I look so fine but I feel so low

She takes me by the arm
She takes me all around
And she knows all her friends are talking
Saying, "Look what our good girl's found"
One thing she's got on you
She's so easy to impress
When she asks me dumb questions
All I gotta do is say yes, yes, yes, yes

Well, I look so fine but I feel so low
Yeah, I look so fine but I feel so low, hey

[Instrumental Break]

Well, I look so fine but I feel so low
Yeah, I look so fine but I feel so low
Yeah, I look so fine but I feel so low
Yeah, I look so fine but I feel so low
Yeah, I look so fine but I feel so low
Yeah, I look so fine but I feel so low
Well, I look so fine but I feel so low
You look out your window at the cold grey dawn
It's seven o'clock on a Monday morning
Pour a cup of coffee, better make it a strong one
Weather man on the radio says it going to rain
And it's going to blow
It'll be all right, it'll be all right, it'll be all right in the long run

Australia marched out of Vietnam
Out in the streets against Uncle Sam
We won the fight, it was a long one
Uranium demo the other way
One of my mates got dragged away
As they slammed the door I heard her say
It'll be all right in the long run

Italian bloke who works with me
We swap laughs and company
And he slapped me on the back
He said "You're wrong, son
This isn't the land I was told it would be
It's not so equal and it's not so free"
But it'll be all right, it'll be all right, it'll be all right in the long run"

From the shadow of history a convict screams
The shearers curse, the people dream
We've taken some right turns, they've been the wrong ones
Troop ships leave and the headlines blaze
Australia remembers happier days
And the faith lives on within the haze
It'll be all right in the long run

So you sit in your camp and you stare at the fire
The doubt drops away as the hopes get higher
And you sing to yourself
It'll be all right, be all right in the long run

And the sun gives ground to a long cold night
And you screw up your courage for another fight
But you know in your heart
It'll be all right, be all right in the long run

And the sun streams in with power and might
You look at your kids in a different light
You know in your heart as you kiss them goodnight
It'll be all right in the long run
No more maybes
Your baby's got rabies
Sitting on a ball
In the middle of the andes

Yeah, Yeah.
I’m a freak of nature
Yeah, Yeah.
I'm a freak

If only I could be as cool as you
As cool as you


Try to be different
Well get a different disease
Seems it's in fashion
To need the cold sore cream

Yeah, Yeah.
I’m a freak of nature
Yeah, Yeah.


I don't really know
How to put on a cool show
As boring as they come
Just tell me where to go

If only I could be as cool as you
Body and soul, I'm a freak

The morning was cold and lonely
City lights old and gray
The sun arose, and, trying to smile
Gave it all away
The honky-tonk called a stranger
The stranger couldn't pay the bill
Made a stand, raised his hand
Sang a song, no time to kill

I said, hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
I've got a tale to tell
I've just been down in New York town
It really feels like hell
It really feels like hell

Billy was out of fashion
Manhattan was years ago
Yesterday he wasted time
Money was kind of slow
Billy had friends of glory
Billy was a friend of fame
Took a chance and raised his hand
Sang a song, now he's back in the game

I said, hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
I've got a tale to tell
I've just been down in New York town
It really feels like hell (hell)
It really feels like hel)

I said, hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
It really feels like hell (hell)
It really feels like hell

Hey, St. Peter
Before you ring your bell
Just been down in New York town
Done my time in hell
Done my time in hell

I said, hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
It really feels like hell (hell)
It really feels like hell (hell)
It really feels like
Hell
Took a drag from something I don't even smoke
And a line from something that some other guy wrote
Now it's red wine for headline, somebody's pulling favours by phone
Is it really so bad or you just want some place to go?
Give me noise and the sound of hearts breaking in songs
Give them profiles and a voice which shows which country you're from
Meanwhile, I was there thinking
Is it really that bad or did you just want me to go?

Hey, before you leave us by the side of the road
I want to tell you 'bout the little I know
It's the cream, it's a crock

Pick it up
And spill your guts to someone who knows
I'll suck you up like a kleenex and leave the mess in the back of my throat
Meanwhile, I was there and thinking
Is it really that bad or did you just want me to go?

Hey, before you leave us by the side of the road
I want to tell you 'bout the little I know
It's the cream, it's a crock
Oh Rusty, let it rock!

Na na na na

Hey, before you leave us by the side of the road
I want to tell you all the friends that you know
It's the cream, it's a crock, yeah

Hey, we're sitting in the middle of the road
I want to tell you 'bout the little I know
It's the cream, it's a crock
Oh let it rock!
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

When you're down and confused
Nothing seems right
And it's you who decides
Who's going to make it right

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

Well life ain't no joke
But it's good when you smile
Steal everything
But you won't get far

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

Sometimes you will fall
What cha gonna do?
Give your friend a call

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

We know that you can smile
Even though it takes a while
To lose your fears and say
Gonna lose your fears and say

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

Do you know who you are
And where you're going to
Don't you know that love
Gonna pull you
Gonna pull you through now baby

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry, Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry, Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry, Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry. Baby don't cry

Face to face 
Anything is possible
Not political, or analytical
Never givin' up on the wrong
You got a choice
Why don't you use it
Change, is an attitude
Guaranteed to take hold of you
So welcome, to the turnstile
Take a turn with a new vow 
Hey, I know what you know
All the sympathy
Made a mess of me
Respect the sacrifice
Before the number one
Now it has begun 

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

Yeah
Yeah

I admit you got the biggest brown eyes
And you know how to bite your lips to tantalise
Sure

Yeah

You can get any girl you want going (and you do it)
And don't say you don't know, 'cause you do

Well, baby

I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
So quit it

I love you, I love you, I do, boy
But you ain't gonna cheat on me
I need you, I need you, I do, boy
Choose, is it her or me?
Choose, is it her or me?

Yeah

Just 'cause I have a say input
You should be ashamed of what I've been seeing

Yeah

You better watch your step
Or, boy, you're gonna loose
The best thing you ever had
Oh-oh-oh

Now he ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore

I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
So quit it

I love you, I love you, I do, boy
But you ain't gonna cheat on me
I need you, I need you, I do, boy
Choose, is it her or me?
Choose, is it her or me?

I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore

So quit it

So quit it

I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
So quit it

When will you give me
A fix of a fix of ready affection
You know if looks could kill
Then I know that they will
I'm all confused
Am I being used
But I'm not waiting for
No I'm not waiting for a rainy day
A rainy day
To give yourself away
When will you give me
A fix of a fix of
Love and affection
I'm losing my mind
And I'm sick and tired
Oh love is not a premonition
When will you give me your love
Cos you're the one I'm thinking of
When will you withdraw the pain
When you gonna take the blame
When will you give me your love
(You keep your feelings in disguise)
When will you give me your time
You're gonna need to realise

When will you give me
A fix of a fix of
Ready affection
And I've just got to mention
My misplaced intention
Of my infatuation
To reach your love dimension yeah

When will you give me ooh
A fix of a fix of
Love and affection
And I've just got to mention
My misplaced intention
Of my infatuation
To reach your love dimension
When will you give me ooh
A fix of a fix of
Ready affection
Reach your love dimension yeah
Reach your love dimension ooh
When will you give me yeah
A fix of ooh a fix of
Love and affection
I look like I live in a coma
I smoke like an iron lung
HIde out in the dark when it's summer
I never go out in the sun
I know that you have a new honey
I know that you have no more time
For me and you spend all your money
On her, well I've made up my mind

I'm coming around
I'm coming around
Better pull your blind down
Better pull your blind down
I'm coming to get you

I'll creep 'round your garden til daylight
I'll look thru your window til dawn
I'm hoping to catch me an eyefull
Of your love and you doing porn
I know that my mind is confusion
I know that you have no more love
For me and I need a transfusion
Or someone to wake me, shake me

I'm coming around
I'm coming around
Better pull your blind down
Better pull your blind down
I'm coming to get you

I look like I live in a coma
I smoke like an iron lung
Hide out in the dark when it's summer
I don't do much fun, but

I'm coming around
I'm coming around
Better pull your blind down
Better pull your blind down
I'm coming to get you

Rockin'and Rollin', you're still doing it now
15 years today and you remember how
You're gonna hear it now
Blastin' out your radio
Listen to the music now
Turn Up Your Radio, Ahhhh..... yeah... alright

Stop what you're doing and listen to us

1956 the juke boxes really jumped
The bass guitar and drums they really thumped
Everybodies learning from what they did a long time ago
Listen to the music now
Turn Up Your Radio, Whah.......yeah...alright

One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock
Five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock
Nine ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock rock. We're gonna rock!!!!!!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oh yeah we gotta rock around the clock baby. I'll tell you what I do
Yeah you gotta rock around the clock Danny boy
Things'll never be the same in Port Lincoln
Since they rolled the cameras there
Roll up and be a movie extra
Take it lightly if you dare

Give the man a uniform
Give the man a gun
He's your younger brother
He's your only son

This is Gallipoli
They coulda been ya mates
They coulda been me

Ya can't blame a bloke who likes adventure
He saw the posters on the wall
See the world through the sights of a rifle
Grab ya mates and go to war

And give the man a bayonet
Give the man a hat
Land him on the beaches
Eight thousand never came back
A rat-a-tat-tat

This is Gallipoli
And don't you forget
You are the Diggers of the Anzac

Slap bang in the middle of an ambush
The johnny turk was all around
Sitting ducks fled like nine-pins
But the Diggers held their ground

And men like Simpson upheld the spirit
Of the Digger who gives a mate a hand
And in the end they showed the world
The spirit of Australia

So things'll never be the same in Port Lincoln
Since they made a movie there
Knock off the shearing
And knock off the fishing
Bring up the clippers and knock off the hair

Give the man a uniform
Give the man a gun
He's your younger brother
He's your only son

This is Gallipoli
And don't you forget
You are the Diggers of the Anzac

This is Gallipoli
And don't you forget
You are the Diggers of the Anzac

[Repeat to fade]
You and me are fire and roses driftin' on a careless sea
Before the final chapter closes, whisper how it has to be
Cover me in sheets of glory, let me see those nerves of steel
Will it be the same  old story, is there something new revealed
Does it come with a sad refrain, does it fall like endless rain
We all love in vain
Tie me up in silk and wire, kiss me while you shine the blade
Did it take you any higher, how long till the moment fades
Does it come with a sad refrain, does it fall like endless rain
Comin' down again
Waitin' for the rain comin' down again
We all love in vain

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)
Now's not the time for wailin'
While there's water in the river
We'll all lay down and cry when it's gone
I'll be a jackass and laugh at every sunrise
Celebrate the day when it's born

And we'll cruise one more time down the river
While our hearts overflow with joy
And we'll reminisce our days down Salisbury Street
Salisbury Street, Salisbury Street
Yeah we'll cruise one more time down the Murray
Don't wave the river gums goodbye
Just thank 'em for the shade and the stories
Tomorrow there'll be time to cry

So untie the ropes my darlin's
There's broken cloud today
And that lucky 'ole' will paint those billows blush
Don't wanna miss the sundown shining on the water
Chasing sneaky shadows through the bush
When m' travellin' days are done
Will you still be with me?
When all the songs have been sung
Standin' right beside me
Watchin' the grandkids grow
I've got everything but nothing without you

I've got mountains, I've got rivers
I've got a chandelier of stars
Got blossoms on the Bloodwoods
Friends all 'round the country
And a heart as good as new
I've got everything but nothing without you

Too much time for thinking
It's gonna drive me mad
I walk along the river
I watch a motel movie
But lovers make me sad
I've got everything but nothing without you

So when this life that binds me

Turns me loose
Lets me rest on m' laurels
Will you put y' head on m' shoulder
And share the peaceful years
I've got everything but nothing without you
Oh, am I fooling you?
Do you fall for it all
Or do you just see right through?
Are you as cool as you believe?
Are you playing hard?
Are you waiting just to quietly clock my card?
Are you waiting for a moment to leave?

I don't know how I bent
What you said
To what I believe you meant
I don't know anything at all
I'm standing in the push and shove
And I'm just within the rescue
Of the labour of your love
I can't do anything but fall
A-fall, a-fall-fall-fall

Why do I feel like I can never find you?
Why do I feel like I'm the only survivor?
Why am I thinking of
You and me and the labour of love?

One chance, one shot
That's all anybody ever got
Newborn, still warm
Naked in the rush hour
Dancing in my gutter
And if you want to find me, call me
I'll be far from the cars and guitars and everybody

Why do I feel like I can never find you?
Why do I feel like I'm the only survivor?
Why am I thinking of
You and me and the labour of love?

[Flute solo]

And I never knew before
But I feel like a child in a cold, cold war
So strong, so tough
Sitting in suburbia, waiting for the wind up
And I don't want to dance
I just want to jump from the prison of circumstance
Why am I thinking of
You and me and the labour of love?

Why do I feel like I can never find you?
Why do I feel like I'm the only survivor?
Why am I thinking of
You and me and the labour of love?
Fair weather friends they wished you well
Showered you with admiration
Now the glass is cracked but you can't turn back
Don't let it break your concentration

Scratched your name on the dotted line
For romance any risk is worth taking
"Don't worry" they say "you'll be rich one day"
Ten years later your hand is still shaking

Won't you take a chance my friend
You've got nothing to lose in the end
Come on scratch my back and I'll see you in America

Now when the piper calls the tune
Songs of joy and desperation
If you're flat on your face just keep your hair in place
There'll be no lack of cheap conversation

So when you're wandering the streets
At four o'clock in the morning
There's only you and some stray sniffin' around Times Square'
Way over there

So if you've got a message to send
And it's driving you round the bend
Come on scratch my back
And I'll see you in America

They bought Manhattan for a song
A few fishhooks for a nation
At the scene of the crime what's yours will be mine
If you give me the right combination

It's amazing who you meet
When you're on your last legs and fading
Merry go round again yeah I'll see you then
But it'll take some heavy persuasion

Won't you take a chance my friend
You got nothing to lose in the end
Just swallow the bait before it's too late
Come on I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine
We'll schmooze each other 'til the end of time
Into the heavens everlasting
I'll see you in America

Come on and scratch my back
When you're stuck in the track
Take a chance my friend

Yeah, the way that love's supposed to be, yeah

Sometimes I know we fight, sometimes things don't seem right
Isn't that the way love's supposed to be?
And girl, I know it's hard, don't let things fall apart
Isn't that the way love's supposed to be?

Always chilling with my boys, I never had time for you
Now I'm thinking that I'm missing out on all the things we used to do
Now I'm thinking that I'm all confused
Coz everybody needs to love somebody, I really need to love your body
You know I'm here for you, there's nothing I won't do
Coz you're my everything, girl, you know

Sometimes I know we fight, sometimes things don't seem right
Isn't that the way love's supposed to be?
And girl, I know it's hard, don't let things fall apart
Isn't that the way love's supposed to be?

Oh I think you better hear me out, coz what I got to say to you
Everybody has their ups and downs, maybe that ain't nothing new
I need you with me, baby, ain't no doubt
Everybody needs to love somebody, I really need to love your body
You know I'm here for you, there's nothing I won't do
Coz you're my everything, girl, you know

Sometimes I know we fight, sometimes things don't seem right
Isn't that the way love's supposed to be?
And girl, I know it's hard, don't let things fall apart
Isn't that the way love's supposed to be?

Sometimes I know we fight, sometimes things don't seem right
Isn't that the way love's supposed to be?
And girl, I know it's hard, don't let things fall apart
Isn't that the way love's supposed to be?

Now show me what you're fronting, remember the night we first met and
You need to know that I really, really love you so
And I don't wanna leave your love, don't wanna let it go
See I know we've had our shares of ups and downs
In and outs, rounds and rounds, but you know I'm still here
Doing everything for you, what you want me to
Girl, don't you know I'm made for you, uh-huh
You know I'm here for you, there's nothing I won't do
Coz you're my everything, girl, you know

Sometimes I know we fight, sometimes things don't seem right
Isn't that the way love's supposed to be?
And girl, I know it's hard, don't let things fall apart
Isn't that the way love's supposed to be?

Sometimes I know we fight, sometimes things don't seem right
Isn't that the way love's supposed to be?
And girl, I know it's hard, don't let things fall apart
Isn't that the way love's supposed to be?
After the fall things will never be the same
How in the world can anyone love again?

Some of my best work was you
I wish you were here right now
But i still don't want to know if you're moving on

I never dreamed about you
When we were never far apart
And now that i'm without you
You're here all through the night

Some of my best work was you
I wish you were here right now
I would ride the ups and downs
Be a man and get my feet back on the ground
Some of my best work
Some of my best work
My best work was you
But i still don't want to know if you're moving on

There's no lovers up above
No lovers only love
Baby I've been watching you
Watching everything you do
And I just can't help but feeling
Someone else is stealing you away from me
I see it written in your eyes
You confirm it with your lies
Though the web that you weave can hold me
I would rather that you told me
Where you wanna be
Oooh slipping away from me
Oooh slipping away from me
And it's breaking me in two
Watching you slipping away
Baby I've been watching you
Watching everything you do
And I just can't help but feeling
Someone else is stealing you away from me
I see it written in your eyes
You confirm it with your lies
Though the web that you weave can hold me
I would rather that you told me
Where you wanna be
Oooh slipping away from me
Oooh slipping away from me
And it's breaking me in two
Watching you slipping away
...
And it's breaking me in two
Watching you slipping away
...
And it's breaking me in two
Watching you slipping away
Baby I've been watching you
Watching everything you do
And I just can't help but feeling
Someone else is stealing you away from me
I see it written in your eyes
You confirm it with your lies
Though the web that you weave can hold me
I would rather that you told me
Where you wanna be
Oooh slipping away from me
Oooh slipping away from me
And it's breaking me in two
Watching you slipping away
...
And it's breaking me in two
Watching you slipping away
...
And it's breaking me in two
Watching you slipping away
...
And it's breaking me in two
Watching you slipping away
She came from the Cocos Islands with a limp and a snow-shaker huh
Hocked by a fine Arabian ginger Monsignor
He said, "You aints gets nothing 'cause nothing gets made by Koreans"
He had dubbin in his hair and he played the tambourine

They gave him a medal, they caught him shaving his hairpiece
Locked him in confinement wired like a banshee with a blade
She came to him in a dream disguised as a bus crash
Through the mud, the blood and the tears they kissed
And then they slipped away, they were singin'

Chunky chunky air guitar now
Chunky chunky air guitar

He was getting down like a freak show
She was going off like a whale
Chunky chunky air guitar now
Chunky chunky air guitar

Bellhop blues with a midget butt-boy in Sweden
Chockfull of puss and wolved by a little French maid
Eloped with his sister, married in a tag-team wedding
Sticky like a girl undercover of a Japanese glade

She came from the Cocos Islands, she came from the Cocos Islands
She came from the Cocos Islands, she came from the Cocos Islands
And they were singing

Chunky chunky air guitar now
Chunky chunky air guitar
He was getting down like a freak show
He was getting down like a freak show
He was getting down like a freak show
She was going off like a whale

Hot and cold shivers up and down your spine
The blues lose that hold on your mind
Get off your shoes, get yourself high-igh
Let yourself have a rea-eal good time
Tell your friends the truth
You've been bop-bop, boppin' the blue-ues
Bop-bop, I'm boppin' the blues, yeah-heah-heah (everybody)
Bop-bop, I'm boppin' the blues, ah-hah-hah (I said bop i-it)

Bop-bop, I'm boppin' the blues (yeah-heah-hey)
Bop-bop, I'm boppin' the blue-ues, yeah-eah (boppin' the blues)
We started boppin' but we never stopped
It was twelve o'clock when the police knocked
I started runnin' for the back door
But the foundation's shakin' in that o-old dance hall
I turned around and see'd the boys in blue
And guess what, they were boppin' the blue-ues
Bop-bop, I'm boppin' the blues, hey-hey-hey (everybody)
Bop-bop, I'm boppin' the blues, ah-hah-hah (I say bop i-it)

People just ain't no good
I think that's well understood
You can see it everywhere you look
People just ain't no good

We were married under cherry trees
Under blossom we made our vows
All the blossoms come sailing down
Through the streets and through the playgrounds

The sun would stream on the sheets
Awoken by the morning bird
We'd buy the Sunday newspapers
And never read a single word

People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good

Seasons came, seasons went
The winter stripped the blossoms bare
A different tree now lines the streets
Shaking its fists in the air

The winter slammed us like a fist
The windows rattling in the gales
To which she drew the curtains
Made out of her wedding veils

People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good

To our love send a dozen white lilies
To our love send a coffin of wood
To our love let all the pink-eyed pigeons coo
That people they just ain't no good
To our love send back all the letters
To our love a valentine of blood
To our love let all the jilted lovers cry
That people they just ain't no good

It ain't in their hearts they're bad
They can comfort you, some even try
They nurse you when you're ill of health
They bury you when you go and die
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
They'd stick by you if they could
But that's just bullshit
People just ain't no good

People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good

Show me a way to stop lovin you
And I'll stop coming 'round
Your flatmate in the front room
He thinks he may have found -
The last of the teenage lovers
Surprised by what I feel
The last of the teenage lovers
I'm learning how to deal

With the ease of the midnight visit
The ease of the midnight visit
Takes a leap of faith
That you might be alone

I was dreamin of you this morning
Dreaming all last night
Your greedy new manoeuvres
They moke me up in fright
I watched the sunlight climbing up my bedroom door
Who had taught my sweetheart to ask for so much more

Ahh with the ease of the midnight visit
The ease of the midnight visit
Takes a leap of faith
That you might be alone

Born again to die again
My soul is in this body
Born again to die again
My soul is in this body
Better give it a bit of peace

I was trying to save your flatmate
From getting out of bed so late
Like a big old clumsy cat
Perched on top of your side gate
The last of the teenage lovers thinks
"What a way to go"
I'd call the ambulance myself
If could reach the phone
The last of the teenage lovers
"What a way to go"
Its not enough to be in love wth you
I want to be loved too

Yeah thats the ease of the midnight visit
Takes a leap of faith that you might be alone
Yeah that's the ease of the midnight visit
Takes a leap of faith that you might be alone
Whens a fool like me gonna drive straight home?

Picture yourself by yourself, 
No tomorow yesterday, 
Drowning in your own decay, 
You'll never be alone this time, 

So follow the trend break or bend, 
It's your funeral long goodbye, 
Shut tight an open eye, 
You'll never be alone, 

Over out, 
It's all over out, 
It's a slow decay, 
You'll never be alone, 

In the shade of the fire, 
No desire for the comfort, 
Pleasure's pain, 
Lost on your motorway, 
Just look the other way again, 

And the better the drain, 
Force again and the push to, 
Stall within, 
Cornered by the cinder's sin, 
Just look the other way, 

Over out, 
It's all over out, 
It's a slow decay, 
You'll never be alone, 

Over out, 
It's all over out, 
It's a slow decay, 
You'll never be alone, 

All has begun and the empty is falling 
Over the edges and in though your walls, 
And it's harder to win and harder to take, 
And we live for the day, 
We're no longer awake and it's....... 

Over out, 
It's all over out, 
It's a slow decay, 
You'll never be alone, 

Over out, 
It's all over out, 
On your way down, 
All it's lost, 
On your way down...

I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications

Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be alright
Perhaps its just my imagination

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away

Alone between the sheets
Only brings the exasperation
It's time to walk the streets
Smell the desperation

At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night
From overkill

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away
Come back another day

I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications

Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be alright
It's just overkill

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away
Ghosts appear and fade away
Ghosts appear and fade away
G'day g'day, how ya goin', what d'ya know, well strike a light
G'day g'day, and how ya go-o-o-in'
Just say g'day g'day g'day and you'll be right

Isn't great to be an Aussie
Takin' a walk along the street
Lookin' in shops or buyin' a paper
Stoppin' and havin' a yarn with people that you meet

Down at the pub or at a party
Whenever you're stuck for what to say
If you wanna be dinky-di, why don't you give it a try
Look 'em right in the eye and say goo'day

G'day g'day, how ya goin', hat d'ya know, well strike a light
G'day g'day, and how ya go-o-o-in'
Just say g'day g'day g'day and you'll be right

Now when Italians meet they all go crazy
The blokes all like to hug each other too
The Yanks invented "hi" "and see you later"
While the Pommy will shake your hand and say "how do you do"

Now watch out for a Frenchmen or he'll kiss you
The Spaniards go for "Olah" and "Olay"
But in the land of the cockatoo, pole cats and the didgeridoo
When you meet an Aussie ten-to-one here's what he'll say

G'day g'day, how ya goin', what d'ya know, well strike a light
G'day g'day, and how ya go-o-o-in'
Just say g'day g'day g'day and you'll be right

It's a greeting that you'll hear across Australia
From Geraldton to Goulburn, Gundagai
It's as dinkum as the Dingo and the Dahlia
And you spell it with a G, apostrophe, a D-A-Y

G'day g'day, how ya goin', what d'ya know, well strike a light
G'day g'day, and how ya go-o-o-in'
Just say g'day g'day g'day and you'll be right

G'day g'day, and how ya goin', what d'ya know, well strike a light
G'day g;day, and how ya go-o-o-in'
Just say g'day g'day g'day
Just say G'day g'day g'day and she'll be right
Pastel red to burgundy and spinifex to gold
We've just come out of the mulga where the plains forever roll
And Albert Namatjira has painted all the scenes
And a shower has changed the lustre of his land

And it's raining on the rock, in a beautiful country
And I'm proud to travel this big land, like an Aborigine
And it's raining on the rock, what an almighty sight to see
And I'm wishing on a postcard, that you were here with me

Everlasting daisies and the beautiful desert rose
Where does their beauty come from, heaven knows
I could ask the wedgetail, but he's away too high
I wonder if he understands, it's wonderful to fly

And it's raining on the rock, in a beautiful country
And I'm proud to travel this big land, like an Aborigine
And it's raining on the rock, what an almighty sight to see
And I'm wishing on a postcard, that you were here with me

It cannot be described with a picture
The mesmerising colours of the Olgas
Or the grandeur of the rock
Uluru has power

And it's raining on the rock, in a beautiful country
And I'm proud to travel this big land, like an Aborigine
And it's raining on the rock, what an almighty sight to see
And I'm wishing on a postcard, that you were here with me
Somewhere deep inside
Something's got a hold on you
And it's pushing me aside
See it stretch on forever

I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

Stripping back the coats
Of lies and deception
Back to nothingness
Like a week in the desert

So don't say no
Don't say nothing's wrong
Cos when you get back home
Maybe I'll be gone

It would cause me pain
If we were to end it
But I could start again
You can depend on it

I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

I sang your praises daily
And we let ourselves get swept away
It's true baby
We held heaven in our hands for days
You wait a long time
For something wild to take you somewhere
And all I needed was to fly
It's a long way from paradise to ordinary
Picture us just smiling there, we didn't have a care

I remember, how it all came true
It was oh so tender
And I was lost with you
By the sweet sorrento moon

But the stars don't burn that brightly
Every season surely slips away
But you baby
You're the reason why I chose to stay
You wait a long time to find your dream and hold on to it
And all I needed was to fly
It's a long day from innocence to understanding
A picture of a child at play, is how I feel today

And I remember, how it all came true
It was oh so tender, and I was lost with you
By the sweet sorrento moon... (la luna de sorrento)
Here I am, lost in the light of the moon that comes through my window
Bathed in blue, the walls of my memory divides the thorns from the roses
It's you and the roses

Touch me and I will follow in your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow
As I let you go I will find my way when I see your eyes
Now I'm living in your afterglow

Here I am, lost in the ashes of time, but who owns tomorrow?
In between the longing to hold you again
I'm caught in your shadow, I'm losing control
My mind drifts away, we only have today

Touch me and I will follow in your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow
As I let you go I will find my way
I will sacrifice 'til the blinding day when I see your eyes
Now I'm living in your afterglow

When the veils are gone, as I let you go, as I let you go

Touch me and I will follow in your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow
As I let you go I will find my way, I will sacrifice
Now I'm living in your afterglow

Bathed in blue, the walls of my memory divides the thorns from the roses
It's you who is closest
The stars out here are so clear in the sky
Everywhere I look they're filling up my eye
The world is turning on its giant wheel
If you were here I'd show you how I feel
Your loving is on my mind
Your loving is on my mind
The curlew just now made its mournful cry
Somewhere, someone's just about to die
Your country mouth takes my breath away
I need more sleep before the break of day
Your loving is on my mind
Your loving is on my mind
I was dreaming last night of a.big house by the sea
There were people and things and then just you and me
You led me down the path onto the sand
You're a miracle, girl, I'll never understand
Your loving is on my mind
Your loving is on my mind
Did we ever meet in Zanzibar
Two caucasians at the town bazaar
Are you who you say you are?
Did you offer me a Dutch cigar?
You must have thought you were so bourgeois
Are you who you say your are?

After all these years, you haven't changed at all
But I can't say you look the same

Summer days are hot in Zanzibar
And at night the sky is filled with stars
Listen, you can hear guitars

Native people, skins as black as tar
Wear bright-coloured robes in Zanzibar
They've never even heard of ska
On a guided tour of limestone caves
Did we see where the traders kept their slaves?
Was that how we spent the day?

After all these years, you haven't changed at all
But I can't say you look the same

I have never been to Zanzibar
I have always thought it was too far
You're not who you say you are
You're not who you say you are
You're not who you say you are
If I did not have an ego I would not be here tonight
If I did not have an ego I might not think that I was right
If you did not have an ego you might not care the way you dressed
If you did not have an ego you'd just be like the rest

Ego is not a dirty word
Ego is not a dirty word
Ego is not a dirty word
Don't you believe what you've seen or heard

If Jesus had an ego he'd still be alive today
And if Nixon had no ego he might not be in decay
If you did not have an ego you might not care too much who won
If I did not have an ego I might just use a gun

Some people keep their egos in a bottom drawer
A fridge full of Leonard Cohen
Have to get drunk just to walk out the door
Stay drunk to keep on goin'
So if you got an ego
You better keep it in good shape
Exercise it daily
And get it down on tape

Ego
I will come for you at night time
I will raise you from your sleep
I will kiss you in four places
I'll go running along your street
I will squeeze the life out of you
You will make me laugh and make me cry
We will never forget it
You will make me call your name and 
I'll shout it to the blue summer sky
We may never meet again
So shed your skin and lets get started
And you will throw your arms around me

I dreamed of you at night time
And I watched you in your sleep
I met you in high places
I touched your head and touched your feet
So if you dissapear out of view
You know, I will never say goodbye
Though I try to forget it
You will make me call your name and 
I'll shout it to the blue summer sky

We may never meet again
So shed your skin and lets get started
And you will throw your arms around me
Yeah you will throw you arms around me
(repeat to end)

You throw me in a pan 
You cook me in a can 
You stretch me with your hands 

You love to watch me bake 
You serve me up with cake 
And that's your big mistake 

Your guest comes in dressed smart 
You offer a la carte 
You didn't have the heart 

And I want a tv embrace 
And I, I'm getting off your boiling plate 
They swore you'd steal my steam to feed your dream 
And then be gone 
I wish I could say that everyone was wrong 

You left me burned and seared 
You left me ripped and teared 
And older than my years 

I should have know at first 
That you would leave me hurt 
You had to try dessert 

No way to let off steam 
Don't bother milk or cream 
No way to let off steam 

And I want a tv embrace 
And I, I'm getting off this boiling plate 
They swore you'd steal my steam to feed your dream 
And then be gone 
I wish I could say that everyone was wrong 

It must feel good to stand above me 
While I make you so proud of me 
It must feel good that I'm now gone 
I wish I could say that everyone was wrong 
I wish everyone was wrong 
I wish everyone was wrong 
I wish everyone was wrong 
I wish everyone was wrong 
I wish everyone was wrong
You told me goodbye and I believed you
Felt like I would die, I didn't need to, no
'Cause you came back to me
And everything's like it used to be

All the good times we had we'll have again (times we had)
All the good times we had we'll have again

If your love is mine it will stand up, hey
To the test of time, it will stand up
It looked like we were through
But in our heart of hearts we knew

The good times we had we'll have again (times we had)
All the good times we had we'll have again
And again
Now, I know you'll always be my friend
'Til the end
That means more to me than anything

Oo-hoo

Who needs yesterday? that's far behind us
It is and memories only may serve to remind us
That what felt good before (good before)
Today we'll treasure so much more

All the good times we had we'll have again (times we had)
All the good times we had (we'll have again) and again, and again (times we had)
(All the good times we had) we'll have again (times we had) and again, and again
(All the good times we had we'll have again) Now I know that you'll always be my friend
(All the good times we had we'll have again) (the times we had)
(All the good times we had we'll have again) (the times we had)
(All the good times we had we'll have again) yeah, yeah (the times we had) yeah
(All the good times we had we'll have again)

Found myself just the other day
In the backyard of a friends place
Thinking about you
Thinking of the crowd you're in
What you're up to, where you've been
Just thinking...

You know the clothes that you wear, and the colour in your hair
Shouldn't change you
Now you tell me why is it so
You're bigger than Almighty Joe
At least you think so

God my fingers burn
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know
If I can call you, and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down
Plant your feet back on the ground

Threw my smoke down on the ground
Turned my head and I heard the sound, that reminded me
Of the days so young and sweet
Always so much fun to me

At least I thought so

Now you think you're so damn fine
You could rule the world
No not mine
I don't think so

God my fingers burn
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much, that I don't know
If I can call you and tell you I care

Know the scene that you're in
And the people that you've been with
Just get to me
But you think I'm not as cool
As you are so beautiful
Who you foolin?
Well I'm here to tell you babe
The game you're in is just a game
So damn pretentious

God my fingers burn
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know
If I can call you, and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down
Plant your feet back on the ground

You think you're so beautiful....So beautiful

Twenty storey buildings coming down on me
Mountain ranges sliding into the sea
Rivers of blood running red
I've got a broken heart and a broken head (head head head)

I've got a broken heart and a broken head

I had a little accident
Nothing too serious
Take a look at this place take a look at this mess
Nothing too serious
If you close your eyes it may go away
Nothing too serious
We can do it again some other day
Nothing too serious

Well i shook myself and i feel out of bed
I can't remember a thing or was it something i said
And i don't know my name and i don't know my place
And there's a crack in the mirror, cracking my face (face face face)

Heeey!

I had a little accident
Nothing too serious
Take a look at this place take a look at this mess
Nothing too serious
If you close your eyes it may go away
Nothing too serious
We can do it again some other day
Nothing too serious

(Instrumental Break)

If you miss the train I'm on you will know that I am gone
You will hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

A hundred miles a hundred miles a hundred miles a hundred miles
You will hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

Lord I'm one Lord I'm two Lord I'm three Lord I'm four
Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home

Away from home Away from home
Away from home Away from home
Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home

Not a shirt on my back not a penny to my name
Lord I can't go back home this a way

This a way This a way
This a way This a way
Lord I can't go back home this a way

Lord I'm one Lord I'm two Lord I'm three Lord I'm four
Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home

Away from home Away from home
Away from home Away from home
Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home
Stand in line
With your empty cup you're still waiting
For the future of all your living hope
Wait for the incoming call

Your desperation
Where does it lead to false riches?
And the little girl's greed, your still young
Oh, but you've tasted it all

Is that you?
You used to be so proud
Is that you?
Looking so hungry is that you?

Standing at the back of the breadline
The back of the breadline
The back of the breadline
Meet you where the daydreamers stand
Standing at the back of the breadline

You used to be
So careless and sure of your possessions
A moment before you got too restless
Got up and walked out the door

Don't look to me
Look to the west the sun is setting
You've been second-guessed but there's a future?
Bottom line is what you must believe in

Is that you?
You used to be so proud
Is that you?
Looking so hungry is that you?

Standing in the back of the breadline
The back of the breadline
The back of the breadline
Meet you where the daydreamers stand
Standing at the back of the breadline

Is that you?
You used to be so proud
Is that you?
Looking so hungry is that you?
Don't look to me is that you?
You used to be free
Is that you?
Standing at the back of the breadline

Stand in line
With your empty cup you're still waiting
For the future of all your living hope
Oh, but you've tasted it all

The back of the breadline
The back of the breadline
Meet you where the daydreamers stand
Standing at the back of the breadline

Ward 8 at the Q.E., somewhere down Woodville
A smoky grey Thursday - take out your sword
Stewie was born, there was blood on the sheets
The doctor was drunk and the sister was bored

Home was a weatherboard housing trust unit
A low cyclone fence and a sparse gravel drive
Dad was a truckie from Adelaide to Melbourne
Two trips a week just to keep them alive

The first sentence for Stewie was going to school
In prison-grey trousers he marched in the yard
His mum shed a tear at his vaselined pushback
Clutching a ruler, his name on a card

"Step forward Stewart Bedson," the headmaster said
It seemed like Stewie was always in strife
"Step forward Stewart Bedson," the magistrate said
"This time 10 years...next time, life"

Grades 1 through 7 passed pretty quickly
Detention and caning and one million lines
Stewie could read just enough to get by
Stewie could read all the shoplifting signs

There was a bond for a biro and a fine for some fags
Another kid's bike, leading up to a car
Photographs, fingerprints, juvenile courthouse
A year in McNally's for going too far

"Step forward Stewart Bedson," the magistrate said
Over pine-panelled wood leaned the face of the law
"We think you're a threat to property and justice
Three years up the creek, while we make sure"

A robbery in violence for retaliation
For beatings and bashings at the hands of the screws
Time in and time out and time and again
Is this what they mean by paying your dues?

Some people had plenty while others had none
For the same working week it seemed year after year
Worked over by coppers for tipping the scales
Life wasn't meant to be easy

"Step forward Stewart Bedson," the magistrate said
Over pine-panelled wood leaned the face of the law
"We think you're a threat to property and justice
Three years up the creek, while we make sure"

Ward 8 at the Q.E., somewhere down Woodville
A smoky grey Thursday - take out your sword
Stewie was born, there was blood on the sheets
The doctor was drunk and the sister was bored
I just got back
From the border
And what I saw
Made me know for sure
We're out of order

I had a dream
About New Orleans
At Jackson Square
I heard a prayer
Down to New Orleans

On the run
There's a life for livin'
But the people there
They just don't care
Livin' their life
Like a millionaire
Down on the border

You'll never see me
In old Iran
The women there
Don't know who I am
In old Iran

And I never will go
To Singapore
The people there
Will cut your hair
In Singapore

On their streets
There's a life of plenty
But they'll never know
About the freedom show
They're livin'
In darkness years ago
Down on the border

They built a wall at the border
Not to keep us out
But to leave no doubt
They're out of order, hey

And all the people
Who are trapped within
Serve to show
Just how far we'll go
And how dumb we've been

At the top
Life looks so easy
But they'll never know
What they'll never know
They're much too busy
Countin' all their dough
From the border
From the border

Down on the border
Down on the border
Down on the border
Down on the border
Down on the border
Down on the border
Down on the border
Things'll never be the same in Port Lincoln
Since they rolled the cameras there
Roll up and be a movie extra
Take it lightly if you dare
Give the man a uniform
Give the man a gun
He's your younger brother
He's your only son
This is Gallipoli
They coulda been ya mates
They coulda been me
Ya can't blame a bloke who likes adventure
He saw the posters on the wall
See the world through the sights of a rifle
Grab ya mates and go to war
And give the man a bayonet
Give the man a hat
Land him on the beaches
Eight thousand never came back
A rat-a-tat-tat
This is Gallipoli
And don't you forget
You are the Diggers of the ANZAC
Slap bang in the middle of an ambush
The johnny turk was all around
Sitting ducks fled like nine-pins
But the Diggers held their ground
And men like Simpson upheld the spirit
Of the Digger who gives a mate a hand
And in the end they showed the world
The spirit of Australia
So things'll never be the same in Port Lincoln
Since they made a movie there
Knock off the shearing
And knock off the fishing
Bring up the clippers and knock off the hair
Give the man a uniform
Give the man a gun
He's your younger brother
He's your only son
This is Gallipoli
And don't you forget
You are the Diggers of the ANZAC
This is Gallipoli
And don't you forget
You are the Diggers of the ANZAC
This is Gallipoli
And don't you forget
You are the Diggers of the ANZAC
This is Gallipoli
And don't you forget
You are the Diggers of the ANZAC
Well it cost me thirty bucks to fix my budgie
When the little blighter only cost me five
The veterinary surgeon saw me coming
But I had to keep my feathered friend alive;

He was shaking on his perch, the kids were crying
The family gathered round his little cage
I said I think it's time we got a new one
That's when the family went into a rage

Oh, the waiting room ponged like a rat house
With heart worms and lung worms and lice
And a Persian had her eye on the shoebox
I suppose she thought our budgie might be nice

Well the bird shit on the veterinary surgeon
I heard him say the dirty little chick
Guess he wondered why I didn't use my brains
And hit him over the head with a brick

Oh antibiotics for his color
Two drops a day on his beak
Some powder on the nose for his feathers
And clean out his cage twice a week

Well it cost me thirty bucks to fix my budgie
When the little blighter only cost me five
And the bludger wakes me early in the morning
It's got me puzzled how he survives

One night I'll feed him to the tom cat
Instead of worrying about him when we go away
No-one wants to feed a shitty budgie
When everyone's on holiday

Hey, keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out

Oh, oh, onion skin
Walking around with
Your heart caved in
When you start to roll
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow

Oh, oh, onion skin
You might see the trap
But you still fall in
When things start to roll
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow

These here are crazy times
Try keeping heart in mind
From rolling off
The chopping board
Keep your chin up
And choke back the tears

This here will make you cry
I'm being skinned alive
But I got layers to burn
You'll never get to
My heart at all

Oh, oh, onion skin
You might see the trap
But you still fall in
When things start to roll
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow

Onion skin

Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
Here it comes
Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out

Oh, oh, onion skin
Walking around with
Your heart caved in
Said when you start to roll
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow

Oh, oh, onion skin
You might see the trap
But you still fall in
When things start to roll
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow

Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow

Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow

Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
Onion skin

Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
Onion skin

Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
Onion skin

Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
These here are crazy times

Never get to my heart at all

Stumbling along looking at nothing
Because your eyes are always on your feet
If you ever looked up, you'd see the sun
And the morning you wonder why things are so bleak

Boring and old are the things your told
About the outside world
Just wearing black won't take care of that
Don't be stupid girl

Walking and always talking
But never listening you just kick back
How do you handle all the bullshit
That gets thrown in your way

Repeat Chorus

Don't be stupid
Down on your knees trying to appease
Somebody's mixed up statement
'Cause in not much time your beliefs are the lies
Will be left on the pavement
They'll be left by the way

I've been doing some thinking
About all your preaching and I don't want to know
'Cause that is just conforming
That is not what you want to be

Repeat Chorus
Repeat Bridge

Oh left by the pavement
Oh don't be so stupid girl
You're in your world
All dressed in black
Won't take care of that
Don't be so stupid girl

They had my future wrapped up in a parcel
And no one even thought of asking me
The day I turned fifteen I caught the mail train
To find what else might be in life for me
I rode on trucks and trains and lived on nothin'
Served me right for wanting to be free
Ah well that's the way society looked at it
But it didn't seem to be that way to me
And the biggest disappointment in the family was me
The only twisted branch upon our good old family tree
I just couldn't be the person they expected me to be
And the biggest disappointment in the world wa-as me
I lot more dinner times than there were dinners
I learned a lot that hurt me at the time
Then this quiet country boy went home a different man
With a memory of distance on my mind
But I always spoke too loud and laughed too often
Maybe drank to many glasses down
And perhaps my clothes were older than I realised
A relief to all concerned when I left town
And the biggest disappointment in the family was me
The only twisted branch upon our good old family tree
I just couldn't be the person they expected me to be
And the biggest disappointment in the world wa-as me
And the biggest disappointment in the family was me
The only twisted branch upon our good old family tree
I just couldn't be the person they expected me to be
And the biggest disappointment in the world wa-as me
Know what you really need, but you can't get enough
Too many mouths to feed, well ain't life tough
Call this survival, don't pray for a sign

Know what you really want, you can't get it back
Down on the waterfront, now watch out Jack
Nights on the main line and rust on the rail

I see them swindle this town
I've seen them tumble it down
I've seen red rivers, fire and steel
I feel the thunder chained to the wheel

Know what you mean to me, goes deeper than that
Can't fight your destiny, know where it's at
Don't look for lightning or pray for a sign

I see them swindle this town
I've seen them tumble it down
I heard the legend, I watched the skies
I feel the power, the flame in your eyes
I've seen red rivers, fire and steel
I feel the thunder chained to the wheel
Wheel Chained to the

Know what you really need, you can't get enough
Too many mouths to feed, ain't life tough
Call this survival, don't pray for a sign

I see them swindle this town
I've seen them tumble it down
I've seen red rivers, fire and steel
I feel the thunder chained to the wheel
I heard the legend, I watched the skies
I feel the power, the flame in your eyes
I've seen red rivers, fire and steel
I feel the thunder chained to the wheel

Hey you!
You never should've ran.
You want to make something
that you can take you down again.
This time you say your just fine.
You need a little something
that can make you smile again.
Come on. It won't take long.
You're never going to need
it when you hear that sound again.
It's a sin. You're looking kind of thin.
You need a little bit so you
can impress everybody.
You're still in a daze.

Hey you!
I know you like to prance so get up and
dance so i can spin you round again.
Take your time you're looking just fine.
Let's do a little shuffle and that can make
you smile again.
Come on. It won't take long.
Let's sing a little song
until the sun don't shine again.
But every time you say your just
fine you need a little bit so you can
impress everybody.
You're still in a daze.

You can try hard but you never really
had the time so take a look around see
just what you're going to get inside.
You never should've ran.

Arthur played the bass
He had an angel's face
Jiving with the Hoodoos, man
No-one could take his place

No, no, no, oh, oh

He needed extra cash
So he drove his brother's cab
The day we heard the news, you know
It really hit us bad

Yeah, yeah, yeah
It was the day that Arthur died
It was the day that Arthur died

A black gelato van (A black gelato van)
Finished for the day (For the day)
It met with Arthur's taxi head-on
Down St. Kilda way
By the Prince of Wales, hey
That was the way that Arthur died
Upon the day that Arthur died
I cried

Arthur played the bass
He had an angel's face, well
He jived with the Hoodoo Gurus and you know
No ones ever gonna take his ever loving place
No, no, not me, not anyone here
Since the day that Arthur died
Ever since the day that Arthur died
Ever since the day that Arthur died
So you just keep on drinking
And you try to forget
How they strung up Joe Byrne
To the jailhouse door
Like a marionette

He was dead for two days
And I'll tell you no lies
With the press still around him
Making their money
Shooting postcards of him through the flies

Close your eyes Kate
And I'll sing you to sleep
Close your eyes, your dreams will be sweet
Kate Kelly, Kate Kelly
I'm gonna sing you to sleep

Ned rose up through the mist
Man made of iron
Fighting his way to the smouldering inn
Where Joe and his brother were dying

They had to shoot out his legs Kate
And if you could sleep
You could forget that they cut off his head
For the warden's paperweight

Close your eyes Kate
And I'll sing you to sleep
Close your eyes
Your dreams will be sweet
Don't linger around here
May your soul rest in peace
Kate Kelly, Kate Kelly
I'm gonna sing you to sleep

Now you do horse tricks
In a wild west show
Sharp-shooting Kate
The last of the Kellys
Now the queen of a rodeo

Was Joe your lover?
Did he send you some word?
A friend to your brothers
All the way to the end
Where as brothers-in-arms
They would fall

Close your eyes Kate
I'll sing you to sleep
Close your eyes, your dreams will be sweet
Kate Kelly, Kate Kelly
I'm gonna sing you to sleep
Kate Kelly, Kate Kelly
I'm gonna sing you to sleep

Just keep on drinking
And you try to forget
How they strung up Joe Byrne
To the jailhouse door
Like a marionette
It used to be so easy to be your lover
We wandered through the days like they had no end
But now that you are gone I'm under cover
I just can't think about you as a friend

Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in a crowd
Hear me crying out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me

So now I'll go the minstrel road without
I know there will be times when I need you there
And each night as I sing those songs about you
I'll think back to the time when you used to care

Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in a crowd
Hear me crying out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me

Take it easy on me
Oh baby don't leave me crying
It should be easy to see
I've needed you for so long
Just one more chance with you
One more chance will you, take chance?
Come on and take a chance

Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in a crowd
Hear me crying out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me

It's still up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me
Most people i know think that im crazy and
I know at times i act a little hazy but
If thats my way
And you should know it then
In every way help me to show it

Oooooooo yeah, yeah, yeah

For most of my life i lived a delusion yes
Material gain has caused me confusion but
Slowly in time i learned that my place is to
Tell all that i meet the glory that God is

Oooooooo yeah, yeah

And thats why

Most people i know think that im crazy and
I know at times i act a little hazy but
If thats my
And you should know it then
In every way help me to show it

Oooooooo yeah, yeah, yeah

Most people i know think that im crazy and
I know at times i act a little hazy but
If thats my way
And you should know it then
In every way help me to show it
They take apart their bodies like toys for the local boys
Because they're always there at the edge of the water
They come from the capitol, these city girls go way down
Where the stones meet the sea
And all you young girls, where do you hide
Down by the water, in the restless tide

And the local boys hide on the mound and watch
Reaching for the speech and the word to be heard
And the boys grow hard, hard to be heard
Hard to be heard as they reach for the speech
And search for the word on the water's edge
But you grow old and you grow cold
Yea you grow old and you grow cold

They would come in their hordes, these city girls
With white strings flowing from their ears
As the local boys behind the mound
Think long and hard about the girls from the capitol
Who dance at the water's edge, shaking their asses
And all you young lovers where do you hide
Down by the water, in the restless tide

With a bible of tricks they do with their legs
The girls reach for the speech and the speech to be heard
To be hard, the local boys teem down the mound
And seize the girls from the capitol
Who shriek at the edge of the water
Shriek to speak, and reach for the speech
Reach for the speech to be heard
But you grow old and you grow cold
Yea you grow old and you grow cold
You grow old

Their legs wide to the world like bibles open
To be speared and taking their bodies apart like toys
They dismantle themselves by the water's edge
And reach for the speech and the wide wide world
Ah, God knows our local boys

It's the will of love
It's the thrill of love
Ah, but the chill of love is coming on

It's the will of love
It's the thrill of love
Ah but the chill of love is coming on

It's the will of love
It's the thrill of love
Ah but the chill of love is coming down, people

La da da de, la da da da, la da da de, la da da da, come back to me
Gotta tell you, you've been on my mind, coz we used to spend so much time together
Now it seems that was just a dream and now you've left me behind
You know we used to be friends, I never thought it would come to an end
And now, it's been really strange, so much I want to say

I can't stop this crazy feeling and you are the reason
Oh baby, come back to me, why won't you come back to me? Yeah, you're beautiful
It's your love that I desire, my heart is on fire
Oh baby, come back to me, yeah, you're beautiful, beautiful, so beautiful

Curse the day you ever fell in love, still I pray to the gods above
That you will remember me and we can be like we used to be
And even though by now you may never sway my way, I won't let go
Baby, we could be so real, let me tell you how I feel

La da da de, la da da da, la da da de, la da da da
Oh baby, come back to me, why won't you come back to me? Yeah, you're beautiful

La da da de, la da da da, la da da de, la da da da
Oh baby, come back to me, why won't you come back to me?
Yeah, you're beautiful, so beautiful
La da da de, la da da da, la da da de, la da da da
Oh baby, come back to me, why won't you come back to me?
Yeah, you're beautiful, so beautiful

It's over and done but the heartache lives on inside
And who's the one you're clinging to instead of me
tonight?
And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow wherever you go
I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight

I'm there at your side, I'm part of all the things you are
But you've got a part of someone else
You've got to find your shining star
And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow wherever you go
I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight

And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow wherever you go
I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight
(Goodnight)
I'm a rolling thunder, a pouring rain
I'm comin' on like a hurricane
My lightning's flashing across the sky
You're only young but you're gonna die
I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's putting up a fight
I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
I'm gonna get ya, Satan get ya

Hell's Bells
Yeah, Hell's Bells
You got me ringing Hell's Bells
My temperature's high, Hell's Bells

I'll give you black sensations up and down your spine
If you're into evil you're a friend of mine
See my white light flashing as I split the night
'Cos if god's on the left, then I'm stickin' to the right
I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's puttin' up a fight
I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
I'm gonna get ya, Satan get ya

Hell's Bells
Yeah, Hell's Bells
You got me ringing Hell's Bells
My temperature's high, Hell's Bells

Yeow
Hell's Bells, Satan's comin' to you
Hell's Bells, he's ringing them now
Hell's Bells, the temperature's high
Hell's Bells, across the sky
Hell's Bells, they're takin' you down
Hell's Bells, they're draggin' you under
Hell's Bells, gonna split the night
Hell's Bells, there's no way to fight, yeah

Ow, ow, ow, ow

Hell's Bells
Take a long look around
There's too much commotion in this town
Viper on the street as thick as thieves
They all say they want out but no one leaves
You might caress the holy stone
You may worship some poor fool's paper throne
You can wire up all it takes
You'll just end up one of nature's little mistakes
When things aren't quite as they seem
You cannot find your way
You've lost that golden dream
Meet me on the road
I will share your heavy load
We'll be safe there tonight
In the house of light
You may think your life is cursed
You might know you're gonna die at sea of thirst
You might always be ignored
You may never strike a sympathetic chord
When things don't amount to much
Your hopes are all washed up
You've lost your golden touch
Meet me on the road
I will share your heavy load
We'll be bathed in white
At the house of light
Take a good look around
There's nothin but confusion goin' down
All the stories have been sold
There's no innocence or love to behold
Lift me up take me to the house of light
Lift me up so I can see

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)
Way up on the Arctic coast
There's a club that's just the most
It's the place where the Russians go
When the party lines on hold
The best nightclub in the USSR
Music vodka caviar
It's the cossacks local spot
Where they come in from the cold to that....

Jukebox in Siberia
Pounding out hysteria
Get down get down Vladivostock
Drop a rouble in the slot of that
Jukebox in Siberia
Jukebox in Siberia

In the land of the midnight sun
Rasputin's having so much fun
Trotsky, Marx and Lenin too
They're all drinkin' at the bar
Kruschev he's there looking cool
Michael and Breznev shooting pool
Ivan's up from Gorky Park
To hang out with the Tzar at that....

Jukebox in Siberia
Deep in the interior
Get down get down Vladivostock
All the Russians wanna rock to that
Jukebox in Siberia
Pounding out hysteria
All the Russians wanna rock
Drop a rouble in the slot of that
Jukebox in Siberia
Jukebox in Siberia

When the needle hits that 45
All of Russia starts to jive
When Chuck Berry rings that bell
You know the revolution's alive and well

Deep beneath the Polar ice
The Yankee sailors are dressed up nice
Take the sub up to the top
So they can get on down
If you're CIA or KGB
They might let you in for free
There's a Red Star on the door
You can hear the sound...
Of Balalaika's ringing out
The Beatles singing Twist and Shout
I love the West I love their beer
I'm so glad Glasnost is here at that...

Jukebox in Siberia
Pounding out hysteria
Get down get down Vladivostock
Drop a rouble in the slot of that
Jukebox in Siberia
Jukebox in Siberia
All the Russians wanna rock
Drop a rouble in the slot of that
Jukebox in Siberia
Jukebox in Siberia
Let me tell you about my mountain home
Where all the ladies names are Joan
Where husbands work back late at night
Hopes are up for trousers down
With hostess on a business flight
Taxi in a Mercedes drive
I hope that driver's coming out alive
The garden is a dorsetted
That lady - she's so corseted
She's got 15 ways to lead that boy astray
He thinks he's one and only
But that lovely she's so lonely
She pumps him full of breakfast and she sends him on his way
What a sing song dance
What a performance
What a cheap tent show
Oh no no no no no

Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up (x2)
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up

Silently she opens the drawer
Mother's little helper is coming out for more
Strategically positioned before the midday show
Her back is arched, those lips are parched
Repeated blow by blow
Later at the party all the MPs rave
About the hummers she's been giving
And the money that they save
To her it is skin lotion
For his promotion to
That flat in Surfer's Paradise with the ocean view
What a sing song dance
What a performance
What a cheap tent show
Oh no no no no no

All the kings and queens in the bible
They could not turn back time
So what chance have I of a miracle
In this life of mine?
I only want one day
To unsay the things I said
Undo the thing I did
Twenty-four little hours
Oh God, please wipe them all away
And I promise I will change
If I could start today again
I know I'm not the milk and honey kind
Today I proved it true
When the red mist falls around my eyes
I know not what I do
Please give me back today
And I won't say the things I said
Or do that thing I did
Every minute, every hour
The replay's just the same
And I can't stand the shame
Oh let me start today again
I only want one day
One lousy day, that's all
Of every day that's been before
Since time began
I know my prayer's in vain
But for a second I'll pretend
That I can start today again
Look at all that shines
Baby's down on the world and she knows it
If your spirits running
Why don't we make it rain like we used to
We run
We hide
We wait and we want
The good life
Aw sure
You're right
This ain't, the good life 
Ah, Elegantly wasted
Ah, Elegantly wasted

Look at all the crimes
Baby's down on the world cause she owns it
Making up her life
Nothing more nothing less makes it voodoo 

We run
We hide
We wait and we want
The good life
Aw sure
You're right
This ain't, the good life

Ah, Elegantly wasted
Ah, Elegantly wasted 

Well look at all that shines
Baby's down on the world and she knows it
If your spirits fine
Why don't we make it rain like we used to
We run
We hide
We want
The good life
Aw sure
You're right
This ain't, the good life 

Ah, Elegantly wasted you could be right,
You could be certain
You could be right
Ah, Elegantly wasted
Ah, Elegantly wasted you could be right,
You could be certain
You could be right
Ah, Elegantly wasted feels like feels like 

Elegantly wasted you could be right,
Elegantly wasted you could be certain
Elegantly wasted you could be right
Feels right, feels right
My eyes are not blind, but still they can't see to the other side
Sometimes they're in our minds, reminding how it sometimes was
I repent my own existance
I want to lock back inside embryonic world
My eyes...
But still...
Sometimes they're...
Reminding...
Years of decay, are back and I'm insane
Strange voices whisper my name, calling me to join their game
While I'm in sleep, so deep and sweet
The past wakes me up and I've learned to see
I got no gun in my pocket
Just got my suitcase in my hand
I walk right up to the window
I got my speeches all planned
'Cos every boy must make his fortune
Get in you car and cruise
Every stop light's just a caution
Take care 'cos you might lose

I watch the suit in the background
He's got a phone stuck to his ear
Another suit joins into listen
And then they turn round and stare
The teller looks at my number
The teller looks me in the eye
He sees my lips are faintly twitching
He sees my heels as I fly
'Cos every boy must make his fortune
Get in you car and cruise
Every stop light's just a caution
If that's the law you choose

If I can do a trick or two
It's gotta get you in
And if you think I'm thinking
That you haven't seen a thing
But this time I'm gonna hang ...

I let my suit do the talking
Don't wanna give myself away
My plea is please sir please sir ...
I'm just a child gone astray
But don't you ask for a whisper
Because you'll get not a word
Yeah I already made my statement
And now I'm forging ahead
'Cos every boy must make his fortune
Get in you car and cruise
Every stop light's just a caution
If that's the law you choose

If I can do a trick or two
It's gotta get you in
And if you think I'm thinking
That you haven't seen a thing
But this time I'm gonna hang on to my skin
This guitar only sings the way I play it
It's part of me, just like another arm
It started out as a little ukulele
When I was just a boy on the farm
My fingers were too lazy for piano
But I could hold a tune pretty good
And I couldn't sing a song with a trombone
So I taught myself to play this piece of wood

But I know you are staying beside me
True lovers we both feel the pain
And I'd throw this old box on the fire
Before I'd ever lose you again

Well you never did like this old guitar, did you darling?
'Cause the guitar takes your man away from you
One day I'll write a song for you darling
That'll be the very best that I can do

Will it be a song about a wild wind
With a thunderclap and flashes of blue
Or will it be a song about an angel?
It'll never be as beautiful as you

But I know you are staying beside me
True lovers we both feel the pain
And I'd throw this old box on the fire
Before I'd ever lose you again

This guitar only sings the way I play it
It's part of me, just like another arm
It started out as a little ukulele
When I was just a boy on the farm

But now I am a man with a woman
The words I wanna say won't come through
No matter where this guitar's gonna take us
It'll never be as beautiful as you

When every day begins in yesterday
When every light around you shines
You are the lover of a hundred others
But don't tell me what to do

Retreat resist relent redemption
Be careful not to cut your hair
Be sorry for your sins and all their mothers
But don't tell me what to do, oh no

I am, forever trying to defend
I lost, my childhood qualities when I was ten
Don't quite recall when it began
Oh, I can't remember such a drain

Believe the truth before you breathe it
Beloved sometime very soon
Your pathway forward is an exit doorway
So don't tell me what to do

I am, forever trying to defend
I lost, my childhood qualities when I was ten
Don't quite recall when it began
Oh, I can't remember such a drain
Oh, I can't remember
Such a drain, whoa ho yeah

I am, forever trying to defend
I lost, my childhood qualities when I was ten
Don't quite recall when it began
Oh, I can't remember such a drain

I am, forever trying to defend
I lost, my childhood qualities when I was ten
Don't quite recall when it began
Oh, I can't remember such a drain
Well you can’t sleep in my bed no more
Well you can’t ride in my car
I won’t let you cook for me baby
It’s never gonna get that far

I'm gonna send you back to wherever the hell
It was you came
Then I’m gonna get this tattoo
Changed to another girls name

Oh it ain’t no fun no more
I don’t know what to say
The honeymoon is over baby
It’s never gonna be that way again

Well you can’t borrow my shirts no more
You can’t make love to me
I ain’t gonna be your gig no more
Ain’t the way it’s gonna be
I should have left you baby
Back in that last town
Cause the kinda fool you made me girl
I’ll never live it down

Oh it ain’t no fun no more
I don’t know what to say
The honeymoon is over baby
It’s never gonna be that way again

A-ma-ma-ma, A-ma-ma-ma
A-ma-ma-ma, A-ma-ma-ma
A-ma-ma-ma, A-ma-ma-ma
A-ma-ma-ma, A-ma-ma-ma

Well you can’t sleep in my bed no more
Well you can’t ride in my car
I won’t let you cook for me baby
It’s never gonna get that far

I'm gonna send you back to wherever the hell
It was you came
Then I’m gonna get this tattoo
Changed to another girls name

Oh it ain’t no fun no more
I don’t know what to say
The honeymoon is over baby
It’s never gonna be that way again

Oh it ain’t no fun no more
I don’t know what to say
The honeymoon is over baby
It’s never gonna be that way again
It's a long hot road from Adelaide to Lincoln when the radiator's hissing steam
My heart's beating time to the front-end shake
I got my lights stuck on high beam
The K-Mart carpark in Whyalla's just a flat cracked concrete void
They don't sell many swimming pools so many unemployed

And there's Lear jets over Kulgera
Where the Dust dances in the heat
Sing a song for the poor young little rich country
As they buy it from under our feet
And LTDs in Hawker
And talk of a tracking base
Talking mineral yields in uranium fields
And looking like they own the place

Bundra's just a one-pub town they've got a horse by the only tree
Rooms are cheap, you get beer on Sundays and they don't need locks and keys
The confederate drank his Bourbon straight said "I've came from Mobile"
He said "You keep your blacks and your taxes down investment's so ideal"

And there's Lear jets over Kulgera
Where the Dust dances in the heat
Sing a song for the poor young little rich country
As they buy it from under our feet
And LTDs in Hawker
And talk of a tracking base
Talking mineral yields in uranium fields
And looking like they own the place

Fairchild, Du-Pont, Levi Straus
Union Carbide, Westinghouse
Comalco, Exxon, Remington
Utah, Santos, IBM
SKF for North Rock pride
Mitsubishi, ICI
Goodyear, Mobil, Davis Press
GM Roach, CBS

In the upper Flinders the lone Range Rover come from Con-Zinc Rio Tint
He had a bound prospectus in a leather briefcase and a snow job in fine print
Carte blanche from the mines department in a letter on a lambswool seat
The geiger counter sings of countless prizes at the depth of a hundred feet

And there's Lear jets over Kulgera
Where the dust dances in the heat
Sing a song for the poor young little rich country
As they buy it from under our feet
And LTDs in Hawker
And talk of a tracking base
Talking mineral yields in uranium fields
And looking like they own the place
Woke up this morning from the strangest dream
I was in the biggest army the world has ever seen
We were marching as one
On the road to the holy grail

Started out seeking fortune and glory
It's a short song but it's a hell of a story
When you spend lifetime trying to get your hands
On the holy grail

Well have you heard about the great crusade
We ran into millions, but nobody got paid
Yeah we raised four corners of the globe
For the holy grail

All the locals scattered, they were hiding in the
snow
We were so far away from home, so how were we to know
There be nothing left to plunder
When we stumble on the holy grail

We were full of beans
But we were dying like flies
And those big black birds, they were circling in the sky
And you know what they say, yeah, nobody deserves to die

You know I, I been searching for an easy way
To escape this cold light of day
I been high and I been low
But I have nowhere else to go

There's nowhere else to go

And I followed orders
God knows where I've been
But I woke up alone
All my wounds were clean
I'm still here
I'm still a fool for the holy grail
oh yeah I'm a fool for the holy grail

Well there's no need to analyse this kind of emotion
Cause it comes naturally
A simple case of feeling love and devotion
So tell me tenderly

I wanna give my life to you
I wanna to feel my blood run through you
And oh I want to touch you
Over and over and over again

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea
Running free
Running free

I feel there's no need for compromising my reputation
When you lead me astray
I'm proud to be apart of this fascination
When I hear you say

I wanna there to guide you
I'm gonna feel my love inside you
And oh I want to touch you
Over and over and over again

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea
Running free

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea
(Running free)

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee (Running free)
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea (River to the sea)
You and me

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea

We've got
You are my one true love
You are the voice that is so sweet
In everything I do, you bring the best out of me
You are my wings to fly
You are the wind beneath them
I miss you every night, when I close my eyes
You put your feelings down
You stopped your tears you brought me love
You held on to my heart
You held with hope to have me near
Sometimes I close my eyes
Sometimes I let my hunger rise
I think of all you are, you are the love of my life

All of my dreams and my passions
Are in your hands

All of my dreams and my passions
Are in your hands

All of my dreams and my passions
Are in your hands

You reached me in my need
Your rhythm flows under my skin
I need you desperately
A sweet healing that will begin
You are my one true love
You are the voice that is so sweet
In everything I do, you bring the best out of me
My everything is you
The very motions that I move
And everything with richness
The richness of the peace you bring

All of my dreams and my passions
Are in your hands

All of my dreams and my passions
Are in your hands

All of my dreams and my passions
Are in your hands

Always, always you are with me

Always, always you are with me

Always, always you are with me

All of my dreams and my passions
Are in your hands

All of my dreams and my passions
Are in your hands

All of my dreams and my passions
Are in your hands

You are the love of my life

You are the love of my life

You are the love of my life

He comes to find you on your knees

He comes to find you on your knees

He comes to find you on your knees

From St Kilda to Kings Cross
Is thirteen hours on a bus
I pressed my face against the glass
And watched the white lines rushing past
And all around me felt like all inside me
And my body left me and my soul went running

Have you ever seen Kings Cross
When the rain is falling soft?
I came in on the evening bus
From Oxford Street, I cut across
And if the rain don't fall too hard
Everything shines just like a postcard
Everything goes on just the same

Fair-weather friends are the hungriest friends
I keep my mouth well shut, I cross their open hands

I want to see the sun go down
From St Kilda Esplanade
Where the beach needs reconstruction
Where the palm trees have it hard
I'd give you all of Sydney Harbour
All that land, and all that water
For that one sweet promenade
I'd give you all of Sydney Harbour
All that land, and all that water
For that one sweet promenade
Close the doors, light the lights
We're stayin' home tonight
Far away from the bustle and the bright city lights
Let them all fade away
Just leave us alone
And we'll live in a world of our own

We'll build a world of our own
That no one else can share
All our sorrows we'll leave far behind us there
And I know you will find
There'll be peace of mind
When we live in a world of our own

Oh my love, oh my love
I cried for you so much
Lonely nights without sleeping while I longed for your touch
Now your lips can erase
The heartache I've known
Come with me to a world of our own

We'll build a world of our own
That no one else can share
All our sorrows we'll leave far behind us there
And I know you will find
There'll be peace of mind
When we live in a world of our own

We'll build a world of our own
That no one else can share
All our sorrows we'll leave far behind us there
And I know you will find
There'll be peace of mind
When we live in a world of our own

And I know you will find
There'll be peace of mind
When we live in a world of our own!
You don't have to go ahead and mount a big search
Its as clear as the road to that old Spanish church
As plain as the nose on your cute little face
Its an open and shut case
It'll come quick or ease in slow
But when trouble hits it just won't let go
There's always something you cannot resist
A slow fade with a bitter twist
Hold it up to the mirror
Tell me what you see
Something might look familiar
But it's a bad likeness of me
If you let things slip from bad to worse
It's gonna take a miracle to life that curse
So clear the air get it off your chest
Take our medicine and hope for the best

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)
Edgar Lustgarten reading from "Death on the Crumbles (1924)", from the
BBC Radio show "Scales of Justice":

"By strange coincidence, a thunderstorm had been brewing when Mahon, doing
His grisly work at the bungalow, was dealing with the most grisly job of
All--the head, the woman's head. He had severed it from the trunk, built a
Huge fire in the sitting room, placed her head upon it, then (I owe a debt
Storm broke with a violent flash of lightning and an appalling crash of
Thunder. As the head of Emily Kaye lay upon the coals, the dead eyes
Opened, and Mahon fled out to the deserted shore. When he nerved himself
To return, the fire had done its work. The head was never found..."
How can you see looking through those tears
Don't you know you're worth your weight in gold
I can't believe that you're alone in here
Let me warm your hands against the cold

A close encounter with a hardhearted man
Who never gave half of what he got
Has made you wish you'd never been born
That's a shame cause you got the lot

Hey yeah you with the sad face
Come up to my place and live it up
You beside the dance floor
What do you cry for let's live it up

If you smiled the walls would fall down
On all the people in this pickup joint
But if you laughed you'd level this town
Hey lonely girl that's just the point

Hey yeah you with the sad face
Come up to my place and live it up
You beside the dance floor
What do you cry for let's live it up

Just answer me the question why
You stand alone by the phone in the corner and cry

How can you see looking through those tears
Don't you know you're worth your weight in gold
I can't believe that you're alone in here
Let me warm your hands against the cold

If you smiled the walls would fall down
On all the people in this pickup joint
But if you laughed you'd level this town
Hey lonely girl that's just the point

Hey yeah you with the sad face
Come up to my place and live it up
You beside the dance floor
What do you cry for let's live it up

Let's live it up
Live it up
Mmm live it up
Hey yeah you
With the sad face
Come up to my place
Come up to my place baby

Hey yeah you with the sad face
Come up to my place and live it up
You beside the dance floor
What do you cry for let's live it up

You with the sad face
Come up to my place and live it up
You beside the dance floor
What do you cry for let's live it up

Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night

Saturday night's already old
Walking into Sunday, and I find
All desires are cold
I could walk forever, I don't mind
Show me a light, your company
Goes a little way to help me see
The path on which I'm bound
Rather than the things I leave behind

I've got the keys to the city
Baby
I can feel my luck
I got two days' money
If you light me up
This heart will shine on

"L'esclavage D'amour
It will be ours forevermore"
Words we both recall
Either from a lover, or the law
Saturday night, my steps have shown
I can walk away from all I've know
Goodnight, my friend, goodbye
Remember what they say,
When you're alone, laugh or die
Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong 
Under the shade of a coolibah tree, 
He sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled 
You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda 
You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me 
He sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled,
 you'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me

Down came a jumbuck to drink at the billabong, 
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee,
 he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag,
 you'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
 you'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me
 he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag, 
You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me

Up rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred, 
Up rode the troopers, one, two, three, 
With the jolly jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?
 You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me.  

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda 
You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me 
With the jolly jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?
You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, you scoundrel with me.  

Up jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong, 
You'll never catch me alive, said he, 
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong,
 you'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me.  

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda 
You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me
 his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong, 
You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me. 
Oh, you'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me.

I know, I know, you see me as your own
And you like that
I know, I know, you have to be alone
'Cause you are like that
O-oceans of pa-assion, withi-in your eye-eyes
Don't wanna be your posse-e-ession
The first ti-i-ime
Too-oo young, don't you think
To-oo promise anything
Too-oo young, can't you see
Understand me and let me be
Too-oo young, don't you think
To-oo promise anything
Too-oo young, don't you know
Understand me and let me go
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ay, I'm too young for promises
I know, I know, you got to prove your proud
'Cause you're like that
I know, I know, you make me speak in tones
'Cause you are like that
Chan-anges of seasons, I haven't lived through-ough
Tell what you want and have free-ee-eedom
So what do I do-oo
I'm too-oo young, don't you think
To-oo promise anything
Too-oo young, can't you see
Understand me and let me be
Ah-ay, Too-oo young, don't you think
To-oo promise anything
Too-oo young, don't you know
Understand me and let me go
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm too young for promises
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ay, I'm too young for promises
I'm too-oo young, don't you think
To-oo promise anything
Too-oo young, can't you see
Understand me and let me be
(To young for promises)
I'm too-oo young, don't you see
To-oo promise anything [fade]
The rivers are dry across the land and the farmers fields have turned to sand
'Cause the rain hasn't come for two years going on three
The topsoil's gone with the hot north wind, the crops won't grow and rust set in
And the cruel south wind of winter brought no relief

And the old men in the public bar talk of floods and droughts before
And as the night goes on the conversations die
But the battlers don't give up, it's written on their hands
And in their eye-eye-eye-eye-eyes, and the spirit of the land survives

And on Saturday night in the Royal Hotel, Hank the Dutchman plays guitar
He sings country and western favourites and requests
It used to be his second job, a bit of a laugh for a couple of bob
Now it's all he's got 'cause his crops all died from thirst

Then he spent his savings on cattle and sheep, he got some credit, got in too deep
But stock won't graze on pastures turned to salt

And then he tried to get work as a travelling man selling Rawleighs products from the back of his van
But the cockies all shop in town where things are cheap

And the old men in the public bar talk of floods and droughts before
And as the night goes on the conversations die
But the battlers don't give up, it's written on their hands
And in their eye-eye-eye-eye-eyes, and the spirit of the land survives

The school's all rundown, the roofs rusted and the paint's peelin'
The playground's just a dustbowl, not a spot of green
The kids still kick their footballs sending dust clouds to the sun
And it's good to know the drought can't spoil the fun

And in the cricketers lounge late at night where the cockies talk and the shearers fight
And their wives drink shandies 'cause they'll be dri

Her father says she has to have a name
Not the same as her mom's, but a name just the same
A little ray of sunshine has come into the world
A little ray of sunshine in the shape of a girl
We'll show her the dress that she'll wear
With the gold flowing hair that nature provided
A little ray of sunshine has come into the world
A little ray of sunshine in the shape of a girl
A little ray of sunshine -
I want to know if you think she looks good in the pink
That grandma has bought her ... our own little daughter
She can make you feel good
She can make you feel that it's all worthwhile
Only by her smile, only by her smile ...
Have you noticed she's just like her father
And i think that i'd rather
Her hair was much darker
A little ray of sunshine has come into the world
A little ray of sunshine in the shape of a girl
She can make you feel good
She can make you feel that it's all worthwhile
Only by her smile, only by her smile, only by her smile ...
Talkin' 'bout my little ray of sunshine
My little ray of sunshine
Little ray of sunshine
I can see you now
Friendly face on sahky ground
I stand back of you
It's safer there
I'll see you through

Trusting you
Is there anyway of
Trusting you
I put my
Trust in you
Is there anyway of
Trusting You

Dreams schemes plots and plans
You pat my back and shake my hand
Your sleeve holds an acce
You sing your song
You keep my pace

Your time will come and go
For a while you'll have control
Take your pound of flesh
Feed your greed and
Leave guiltless

She's taking her time making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles
And the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one

They're saying

Mama never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for
The right kind of pilot to come
(and she'll say to him)

She's saying

I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where we all belong
So would you be my baby?

Ooh-ooh
She can't remember a time
When she felt needed
If love was red then she was color-blind
All her friends they've been trialed for treason
And crimes that were never defined

She's saying

Love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith
Is like a journey I just don't have a map for
So baby gonna take a dive and
push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on
the stars

(What a pleasant dream) just saying

I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where we all belong
So would you be my baby?

[instrumental]

Mama never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot
To come (and she'll say to him)

She's saying

(repeat chorus)

yeah

[instrumental]
Take a little walk to the edge of town
Go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms,
like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires,
in the humming wires
Hey man, you know
you're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge,
past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat with
a red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms,
tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all those dreams
it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole,
heal your shrinking soul
But there won't be a single thing
that you can do
He's a god, he's a man,
he's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
is a red right hand

You don't own any money?
He'll get you some
You don't have no car?
He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect,
you feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy,
cause here he comes
Through the ghetto and the barrio
and the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares
you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
he ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head,
on the TV screen
And hey buddy, I'll warning
you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god,
he's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
his red right hand

It's just you jive talkin'
you're telling me lies, yeah,
Jive talkin'
you wear a disguise,
Jive talkin',
so misunderstood,
Jive talkin'
You're really no good.

Oh my child, you'll never know,
Just what you mean to me,
Oh my child, you got so much,
You're gonna take away my energy with all your

Jive talkin'
You're telling me lies, yeah
Good lovin'
Still gets in my eyes,
Nobody believes what you say,
It's just your
Jive talkin' that gets in the way

Oh my love, you're so good,
Treating me so cruel,
There you go, with your fancy lies,
Leavin' me looking like a love struck fool,

With all your jive talkin'
You're telling me lies, yeah,
Jive talkin'
You wear a disguise,
Jive talkin' so misunderstood, yeah
Jive talkin'
You just ain't no good.

Love talkin' is all very fine, yeah
Jive talkin' just isn't a crime,
And if there's somebody you'll love till you die,
Then all that jive talking'
Just gets in your eye.

Jive talkin'
you're tellin' me lies, yeah
Your lovin'
still gets in my eyes
Nobody' believe what you say,
It's just your Jive talkin'
that gets in the way

Love talkin' is all very fine, yeah
Jive talkin' just isn't a crime,
And if there's somebody you'll love till you die,
Then all that jive talking'
Just gets in your eye.

yeah, yeah.

Oh Jive talkin'

(song fades)
Everytime I think
I got it all going
You turn it up
And you turn it all around
Hey babe, let's get it started
The chains of love aren't going to drag you down

You're a walkin' dream
There's no doubt about it
Young blood
Rushin' through my soul
Out on the street
There talkin' about it
There must be some way
Momma we can roll

Come on, come on
Let's get it started
You know you got it
Babe, you make me feel right
Come on, come on
Don't try to fight
Let's get it started tonight

Now I ain't no Rudolph Valentino
I'm just a Johnny
From the street
But you've got that lovin'
Baby sure gets me going
And I ain't too proud
To get down and beg

Wild heart
I see
One shot
Covers me
Just a little bit
I'm holdin' on tight
A little lovin'
Comin' on through the night

Everytime I think
I got it all going
You turn it up
And you turn it all around
Hey babe, let's get it started
Can't wait no longer, I need you right now

You're a walkin' dream
There's no doubt about it
The chains of love
Aren't going to drag you down
Out on the street
There talkin' about it
There must be some way
Momma we can roll

Come on, come on
Let's get it started
You know you got it
Babe, you make me feel right
Come on, come on
Don't try to fight
Oh light it up, you light me up

Come on, come on
Let's get it started
You know you got it
Babe, you make me feel right
Come on, come on
Don't try to fight
Let's get it started tonight

Don't you wanna be
A personality
An ocean in the sea
But you'll never make it
If you can't shake it
So don't mistake it
Just try and fake it
And I want you to know
You don't have far to go
So we'll use all your dough
To buy new clothes
And see what flows
And powder your nose
For those photos
You're almost on your way
To popularity
And we'll teach you to play
With icy stare
And punk rock hair
And beatnik flair
We'll take you there

'Coz there's nobody else like you
And we sure care just what you're doing
After we have gone our seperate ways

So don't you want to be
A big time entity
Your place in history
But don't be scared
Of what we said
'Coz there's no end
To being your friend
But wait out in the hall
We've just received a call
We'll have to dump you all
But don't you try
To pass us by
'Coz we own you
Until we're through

And there's so many round like you
And we don't care just what you're doing
After we have gone our seperate ways
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
Now I'm so blue

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
What should I do

Sitting here looking at your picture
At a smile time can't erase
And like reflections in a mirror, I see you
Holdin' hands with a guy of a different face, yeah

Oh, since you've been gone I've been trembling
Of the need to hold you close
But I've been caught in a syndrome of pride
Oh, baby, from love you just can't hide, no

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
Now I'm so blue

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
What should I do

Sitting reminiscing, lost in thoughts of yesterday
Don't wanna face reality because you're not here with me
Lost in the past, don't think I'll last
Without your love, without your love, yeah

Oh, since you've been gone, I've been trembling
Of the need to hold you close
But I've been caught in the syndrome of pride
Oh, baby, from love you just can't hide, no

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
What should I do

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
Now I'm so blue

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
What should I do
I heard how all the lights went out in Memphis
On the death night anniversary of the king
The pretenders talking dirty in the palace
But it doesn't have that old familiar ring

I see there's been some changes in the valley
All the renegades have finally settled down
Now they worship in the temples of their rivals
And desecrate the holy heart of town

Can't you hear all those sweet voices singing
Takin' care of the chosen ones
Can't you hear all those mission bells ringin'
Say a prayer for the chosen ones

I read they're pourin' oil on troubled waters
Yet they cast a giant shadow on the land
Lets spend another night across the border
And bury all our secrets in the sand

Now they claim there is a message in the Bible
They swear there is no master and his slave
But the future's lookin' dim for the lonesome cowboy
When the hand that rocks that cradle digs the grave

Small changes, hard lovin'
The tide is turnin'
Hey darlin, I've been callin' out your name
But like a tear that's fallin'
I can't get you back again
I'm not pretending that I know where we went wrong
But hey sugar, it's been a hard lovin'

Down the street
Where the houses burn with every kind of neon flame
They lay my heart to sleep
But my soul's driftin' in the rain
You know you got me
On a street so wet with tears
And I can't find no answers here

Tell me, does your heart race
Like a river through the night, now its overflowing
Drowning what you feel inside
I remember what you said
Good love can stand some rain
The streets are shinin', and I can't get warm again

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Control )

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

I don't need crying lies
I don't need stupid alibi's
I don't need convertible cars
And don't think you can push me too far
You got the money, I got the time
Nothing better to do, so you might just change my mind

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

I don't want to see you again
I don't want you for a friend
I don't want you hanging around
I don't mind just putting you down
You got the money, I got the time
Nothing better to do, so I might just change my mind

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

I don't have to tell you
How that you should do your job
I don't want to have to be the one to shock your happy home

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

If a boy had a chance, a chance with someone like you
Are you gonna break his heart, let him cry for the moon
Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?

I just freeze every time you see through me
And it's all over you, electric blue.
On my knees, help me baby,
Tell me, what can I do, electric blue.

Oh I had a dream, For a moment I believed it was true
Oh I'd have given anything just to be there with you
Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?

I just freeze every time you see through me
And it's all over you, electric blue.
In too deep, standing here waiting
As I'm breaking in two, electric blue.
I can see, can see that it may be
Just a vision of you, electric blue.
On my knees, help me baby,
tell me what can I do, electric blue.

(help me baby)

Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?

I just freeze every time you see through me
And it's all over you, electric blue.
In too deep, standing here waiting
As I'm breaking in two, electric blue.
I can see, can see that it may be
Just a vision of you, electric blue.
On my knees, help me baby,
Tell me, what can I do, electric blue.

I just freeze every time you see through me
And it's all over you, electric blue.
In too deep, standing here waiting
As I'm breaking into, electric blue.
I can see, can see that it may be
Just a vision of you, electric blue.
On my knees, help me baby,
Tell me, what can I do, electric blue.

Electric blue
Electric blue
Electric blue
Ain't nothing like the windy city
Where the station-wagon died
Where the wild dogs meet the fences
And the horsemen, fences ride
Where the flatlands become flatlands
And the caravans collide
I'm just sitting 'neath the mango
Running a tide
Took a ride on a bin-train
50 cars or more
They say the heads are just insane
But it's too risky to score
Sittin' on the lawn with Andrea
Draggin' the line for big red
Everyone looks better with a suntan
Easier to get you into bed

Daughters of the northern coast
Sons of beaches, don't deliver the post
You know the post is a ghost

Lee Marlin went lookin' for a marvin
While we were looking for a line at the pub
Hey, and still the black man's starvin'
No wonder nobody wants a job
Helicopter over homestead
Stirring all the young blades at night
They're steppin' out there in the sultry summer evening
Their pistols all packed
And their badges so bright

Daughters of the northern coast
Sons of beaches, don't deliver the post
You know the post is a ghost

Took a ride on a bin-train
50 cars or more
They say the heads are just insane
But it's too risky to score
Andrea's been giving me a towel down
Standing on a palm beach shore
If 'n'those girls keep a doin' that thing
I can't wait for next year
I'm gonna come back for more

Daughters of the northern coast
Sons of beaches, don't deliver the post
You know the post is a ghost
Jump in my car, I want to ta-ake you home
Mmm, jump in my car, it's too far to walk on your ow-own
No thank you sir-ir

See'mon jump in my car, it's too far to walk on your ow-own
Well maybe I wi-ill

Jeepers keep still

No need to get smar-art
Well alright we'll soon be on our-our way-ay

We better start
What for?
Because it's such a long way-ay
Well, why, where d'you live

I live down south, it's roughly eighty-four mi-iles
Hey slow down, you must be jokin' there behind that cute smile
Oh, no I'm no-ot
Well, if you're not there's only one thing to say-ay

And what's tha-at?
Get out the car, get on your way

Get out of my car
But you just said tha-at you'd take me home
Well, if it's not too far-are
But there's no way that I can get there alone

I couldn't care less
Maybe I cou-ould see you next week
But you look a me-ess
Look who's talkin', you got no right to spea-e
I got too much on my mind
Yeah so play that thing in a different style
Caught on a hook and a line
Yeah thicken, use and drive me outta my mind
So I'm down
So punch me in the decals
And see which of my teeth tells
The honour of thieves is hard to prove
But who put the devil in you?

I got too much on my mind
I cross my chest to keep myself in line
Willing the water from wine
I've wasted years looking for somewhere to hide
Lookin down...
Just kick me where the sun shines
And now we're on for hot times
And bashin out to hammer the blues
Yeah who put the devil in you?

I'm finding out where my head's at
Like loose change in a laundromat
It chews me through
From Dallas Crane to Motley Crue

Oh...ooh ooh... ooh ooh...

Yeah but I know
Just why I'm masquerading
And why my tracks is fading
And bash out to hammer the blue
Who put the devil in you?

Ooh ooh... ooh ooh...

I hit on the speed in my shoe
Who put the devil in you?

Cause you know we're going out there again
Just throwing my trust to the wind
We're gonna beat this damn thing to the end
Then kiss it off
Hey

Summer love is like no other love
Oooh yeah-eah-eah
Summer love is like no other love
You know what I mean
Summer love is like no other lo-ove

Cloudy skys are blown by with a breeze
And when that su-un shi-ines
Life comes easy
Bye bye troubles goodby-ye
I'm walkin' with my head in the sky-why-why
See birds sailing in and out of blue
Oh when that su-un shines
I'll be there with you-ou
When you bring your lovin' to me-ee
Let your love come easy and free-ee
Yeah, Listen

Summer love is like no other love
Oooh yeah-yeah
Summer love is like no other love
Summer love is like no other lo-ove
Oo-ooh

Everybody talk about the summertime blues
Just take it easy and let it cruise
The sun is up and the day is fine
I feel so good in the summer ti-i-ime

When you bring your lovin' to me-ee
Let your love come easy and free-ee, Yeah
You know what I mea-ea-ean

Summer love is like no other love
Summer love is like no other love
Summer love is like no other love
Summer love is like no other love
Summer love is like no other love
Standing at the limit of an endless ocean
stranded like a runaway, lost at sea
city on a rainy day down in the harbour
watching as the grey clouds shadow the bay
looking everywhere 'cause I had to find you
this is not the way that i remember it here
anyone will tell you its a prisoner island
hidden in the summer for a million years

Great Southern Land, burned you black

so you look into the land and it will tell you a story
story 'bout a journey ended long ago
if you listen to the motion of the wind in the mountains
maybe you can hear them talking like I do
". . they're gonna betray, they're gonna forget you
are you gonna let them take you over this way . ."

Great Southern Land, Great Southern Land
you walk alone like a primitive man
and they make it work with sticks and bones
see their hungry eyes, its a hungry home
I hear the sound of the stranger's voices
I see their hungry eyes, their hungry eyes
Great Southern Land, Great Southern Land
they burned you black, black against the ground

Great Southern Land, in the sleeping sun
you walk alone with the ghost of time
they burned you black, black against the ground
and they make it work with rocks and sand
I hear the sound of the stanger's voices
I see their hungry eyes, their hungry eyes
Great Southern Land, Great Southern Land
you walk alone, like a primitive man
you walk alone with the ghost of time
and they burned you black
yeah, they burned you black
Great Southern Land
By a warm electric heater and a softly padded chair
In a loungeroom brightly lighted by a glowing chandelier
Since my early days of drovin' the years have taken toll
But I somehow miss my swag wrap by a fire of Gidgee coal
When I wake from sleep each morning and I ring the bedside bell
The maid brings in my breakfast and she fills my pipe as well
There are cakes and sweetened coffee on a tray of sparkling gold
But I miss black tea and damper by a fire of Gidgee coal
I am driven' out each evening by a chauffer spruce and neat
Through the flowered parks and gardens and the crowded city streets
But I drift back through the ages while the big car softly rolls
To a stock route and a wagonette and a fire of Gidgee coal
I attend all social parties in the rich parts of the town
Drinking wine from fancy glasses as the waiters go their rounds
But I'd rather share a bottle with those drovin' mates of old
In a pair of dusty moleskins by a fire of Gidgee coal
In a pair of dusty moleskins by a fire of Gidgee coal
Up so early feel so bright 
Didn't get much sleep last night 
Freight train rattled through my head 
Whistle blowing love is dead 
Is dead 

Heart attacked by fear and doubt 
won't be long till the truth comes out 
first impressions never lie 
Lover's bonds they hold so fast 

Restless future burning bright 
The past is holding on so tight 
Never heard the warning bell 
And I just want to wish you well 
I just want to wish you well 

Welcome swallows dip and swing 
Take their cue from the slightest thing 
Rolling fog into my room 
Why did you give up on me so soon? 
So soon 

Restless future burning bright 
The past is holding on so tight 
Never heard the warning bell 
And I just want to wish you well 
I just want to wish you well 
I just want to wish you well 
I just want to wish you well 

Why did you give up on me so soon? 
Did you give up on me so soon? 
I just want to wish you well 
I just want to wish you well

Leandra Benjamin
Moon shines hard on trouble
Check your watch by the lake city shuttle
And she tries hard not to decide
Are you gonna tell him where you go nightly?
When you're dressed so brightly
Is the money gonna come without a price?
A hundred holes and bubbles
You gotta avoid trouble
Just waiting for something to arrive
And all your daydream heroes
Are losing their hair, teeth and halos
Who're you fall into tonight?

Pay the bills for uncle Ted he's a nutter
Lives on bananas and peanut butter
Keeps his teeth in a glass of Long Island tea
And are you gonna tell him where you go nightly?
And that the kids are tucked in tightly?
Is the city big enough for you to hide?

A hundred holes and bubbles
You gotta avoid the trouble
Of waiting for a way out to arrive
All your daydream heroes
Are losing their hair, teeth and halos
Who're you fall into tonight?

Are you gonna tell him where you go nightly?
He think its best to criticize his own kind
An animal of greed, best to sew that social seed
I though by my thoughts all would come clear to me
Yeah I can shoot a gun, maybe I should join the army
Is there a quite place to lie?
Maybe watch all this go by
Wonder how we can survive
Wasting energy, where's the ememy
I'd soldier on and walk the cruvy line so straight
But I would fall behind, maybe I am not so blinded

You talk so much pity that is self-related
Blaming not yourself, said the fault lies somewhere else
Repeated when the feelings high
I wish it all could just rely
On the depth of you and I
Wasting energy, where's the enemy?
When the convicts arrived in Australia
The soldiers didn't have a lot to do
So for entertainment they made the convicts dance
While the soldiers piped a tune

It was the British domination quickstep
Quick step up your work, listen to the beat
They've got the power in their hands
And the load off their feet

100 years later, the governor was still on his seat
The people were farming and mining
The cockies ate the chaff
While the squatters ate the wheat

Two World Wars later, Rule Britannia began to die
Pig Iron Bob rocked the cradle
Yankee Doodle was the nation's lullaby

It's the yankee domination quickstep
Quick step up your work, listen to the beat
They've got the power in their hands
And the load off their feet

It's now the foreign domination quickstep
Quick step up your work, listen to the beat
They've got the power in their hands
And the load off their feet
Mum and Dad and Denny saw the passing out parade at Puckapunyal
(1t was long march from cadets)
The Sixth Battalion was the next to tour and it was me who drew the card…
We did Canungra and Shoalwater before we left
And Townsville lined the footpath as we marched down to the quay;
This clipping from the paper shows us young and strong and clean;
And there's me in my slouch hat, with my SLR and greens…
God help me, I was only nineteen
From Vung Tau riding Chinooks to the dust at Nui Dat
I'd been in and out of choppers now for months
But we made our tents a home, VB and pin-ups on the lockers
And an Asian orange sunset through the scrub
And can you tell me, doctor, why I still can't get to sleep?
And night time's just a jungle dark and a barking M16?
And what's this rash that comes and goes, can you tell me what it means?
God help me, I was only nineteen
A four week operation, when each step could mean your last one on two legs:
It was a war within yourself
But you wouldn't let your mates down 'til they had you dusted off
So you closed your eyes and thought about something else
Then someone yelled out "Contact"', and the bloke behind me swore
We hooked in there for hours, then a God almighty roar;
Frankie kicked a mine the day that mankind kicked the moon: -
God help me, he was going home in June
1 can still see Frankie, drinking tinnies in the Grand Hotel
On a thirty-six hour rec. leave in Vung Tau
And I can still hear Frankie lying screaming in the jungle
'Till the morphine came and killed the bloody row
And the Anzac legends didn't mention mud and blood and tears
And stories that my father told me never seemed quite real
I caught some pieces in my back that I didn't even feel…
God help me, I was only nineteen
And can you tell me, doctor, why I still can't get to sleep?
And why the Channel Seven chopper chills me to my feet?
And what's this rash that comes and goes, can you tell me what it means?
God help me
I was only nineteen

Well I've ripped and dug out burrows on a sandy bulloak hill
Eradicating rabbits doesn't take a lot of skill
But a boy born in the Mallee doesn't find 'em hard to kill
No self-respecting farmer lets a rodent eat his wheat
He'll shoot 'em and he'll skin 'em and he'll dress 'em up to eat
But since the spread of mixo He's almost got 'em beat
And I don't mind at all if you call me a Mallee boy
Where little town dogs howl at the morning train
Where a cocky makes a living on twelve inches of rain
Where his woman provides and is rare to complain
And I still love the smell of that sandy soil
Some say it's dusty, some say it's gold
Cause it grows the sweetest fat lambs the markets ever sold
And I don't mind at all if you call me a Mallee Boy
No I don't mind at all if you call me a Mallee Boy
Where you can lose an ear on duck opening day
Where slickers bring their shotguns from miles away
And shoot the life out of shags and swans that fly their way
Where a bloke grows as stocky as a Mallee bull
Where they come from miles around to see the tractor pull
When the paddocks are clean and seed silos are full
And I don't mind at all if you call me a Mallee Boy
Well I've ripped and dug out burrows on a sandy bulloak hill
Eradicating rabbits doesn't take a lot of skill
And a boy born in the Mallee doesn't find 'em hard to kill
But they'll never be as rare as a Quandong tree
My grandma made some jam for my brothers and me
They're like the Mallee Fowl you hardly ever see
But I don't mind at all if you call me a Mallee Boy
No I don't mind at all if you call me a Mallee Boy
No I don't mind at all if you call me a Mallee Boy
Living easy, livin' free
Season ticket, on a one,way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the Highway to hell

No stop signs, speedin' limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me 'round
Hey Satan! Paid my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey Mama! Look at me
I'm on my way to the promise land. Wow!

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
On the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

Don't stop me

I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
On the Highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the Highway to hell
On highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

And I'm going down all the way
I'm on the highway to hell
You've heard about Ned Kelly and those other famous crooks
I've seen them on the TV, I've seen them in my picture books
Well, here's a little song about a bloke so bad and mean
An evil, vicious outlaw, the worst there's ever been

Oh, out in the bush where the kookaburras fly where the gum trees reach to the clear blue sky
There's a cave in the hillside where I hide, I'm a big, bad bush-bushranger

Deep in the cave there's a big, black hole that's filled to the brim with locks of gold
And diamond rings and things I stole, I'm a big, bad bush-bush ranger

Late at night when the sun goes down and everyone's asleep in town
I count all my money in my dressing gown, I'm a big, bad bush-bushranger

I'm a bush, I'm a bush, I'm a bush-bush ranger
Runnin' from the law, livin' on danger
Bang, bang, hands up, stick 'em up straight
I'm a big, bad bush-bush ranger

Got a rope and a whip and a gun, of course, I'm chased everywhere by the bush police-force
While I ride through the night on my big black horse, I'm a big, bad, bush-bush ranger

And when the townsfolk see me ride they lock all the doors and stay inside
And find a place that's safe to hide, I'm a big, bad, bush-bush ranger

I ride thirty miles through the wind and hail to hold up a bank or the Royal Mail
I give all my money to my girlfriend, Gayle, I'm a big, bad, bush-bush ranger

I'm a bush, I'm a bush, I'm a bush-bush ranger
Runnin' from the law, livin' on danger
Bang, bang, hands up, stick'em up straight
I'm a big, bad bush-bushranger

I sleep every mornin' till half past nine, have m'brekky in bed, then rise and shine
Get dressed in my best for my life of crime
Well I met her at a disco in the School of Arts Hotel
The kind of place that some girls won't attend
The moon shone over Edwards Street and later I could tell
I'd never be a lonely man again
In Charleville (in Charleville), in Charleville (in Charleville)
There's a pretty little woman says she'll say I will
In Charleville (in Charleville), in Charleville (in Charleville)
There's a pretty little woman says she'll say I will
We're gonna have a wedding cake that's twenty layers high
And fifteen hundred family and friends
We'll cook ourselves a dozen lambs and drink the district dry
Then whip around the hat and start again
In Charleville (in Charleville), in Charleville (in Charleville)
There's a pretty little woman says she'll say I will
In Charleville (in Charleville), in Charleville (in Charleville)
There's a pretty little woman says she'll say I will
Instrumental
Well I've seen Girls in Paris to humble any man
I've seen Earls embarrassed by models in Milan
But I've seen enough to know the only girl I need to see
And she's waiting back in Charleville for me
In Charleville (in Charleville), in Charleville (in Charleville)
There's a pretty little woman says she'll say I will
In Charleville (in Charleville), in Charleville (in Charleville)
There's a pretty little woman says she'll say I will
In Charleville (in Charleville), in Charleville (in Charleville)
In Charleville (in Charleville), in Charleville (in Charleville)
In Charleville (in Charleville), in Charleville (in Charleville)
There's a pretty little woman says she'll say I will

You met her at a party on Saturday night
She was drinkin' advocaat
Her skin was smooth and her jeans were tight
You didn't think she'd go that far
She mighta looked like a princess
But why'd you have to give her your address
Cos you ain't safe when you get home
She's gonna call you on the telephone

Hey boy that's Balwyn callin'
Hey boy that's Balwyn callin'
Hey boy that's Balwyn callin'
Get on the phone and do a bit of stallin'

It was just too easy when you got to her flat
And she kicked off her platform shoes
And you played around like a cat and a rat
And now you've got the Balwyn blues
Well you thought she ould be a one nighter
But she wants to squeeze you tighter
Cos you ain't safe when you get home
She's gonna call you on the telephone

She sure knows when she's got a good catch
And she just won't let go
She's been searchin' for the perfect match
Her ambition with your dough
A brick veneer prison is waitin' for you
But you just smile while she turns the screw
And you ain't safe when you get home she
She's gonna call you on the telephone

Hey boy that's Balwyn calling X 3
Get off the phone and get out of Balwyn

You picked me up when I was down with nothing
And gave me something , I can't face the world without
You showed me just enough to fuel my fire
My desire, never wanna live without it

Both of us need something like we had before
We can't keep fighting like this anymore
This love affair is breaking my heart

All the pushing and the shoving
When we know that we ought to be loving
And the lying and the cheating
When we ought to be loving and squeezing
Come on come on
Lay down your guns and surrender

Remember days we thought would last forever
Nothing better but we let them slip away
Cause in the end we make the bed we lie in
Lets start trying
What's the point of talking about it

Never seems to make it better
If we can't get on together
Take a chance and try a brand new start

All the pushing and the shoving
When we know that we ought to be loving
And the lying and the cheating
When we ought to be loving and squeezing
Come on come on
Lay down your guns and surrender
Peter's a cabby on Adelaide roads
And in five o'clock traffic that's a hard road to hoe
Hunts for his family in a Holden with a two-way and meter
And there's no air conditioning where he plies his trade
On the green plate stand by the Rundle Arcade
Sits and he waits for the privilege of driving you home

And there's no Mr. Muzak in the front of his cab
Just a crackling voice dog-eared roadmap
And a torch and a biro sliding around on the dash
And your life's in his hand when they're gripped on the wheel
The water pump rattles and the Michelins squeal
He's been driving for years sometimes it feels like forever

And knows very well your city of gardens
He'll take you from town drop you at Marsden
Peak hour: five minutes, if you think that's easy just try it
He can change a flat tire in three minutes flat
Lubes his own car lying flat on his back
Tunes up his motor with a timing light in his ear

Oh you could be at Woodville, you could be at Stirling
Sun may be burning, fog may be swirling
But Peter's still driving all down that endless white line
Could be the morning, midday or midnight
He'll sell you a ride, his yellow roof light
Till a drag operator gives him a job to go home

I pulled out of the suburbs by sunset
Rain was falling, it looked like it would for a while
I had a radio, a six-pack, and some cigarettes
The radio died after the first hundred miles

I sang all the way to the border
And guess who starred in every rhyme
Ah, you know and I know that love never runs on time

I followed that old river 'til the morning
I stopped, I don't remember the name of the town
But the colour of the coffee spelled a warning
It was the colour of the river but not nearly as brown

The waitress poured me another
I guess she was the mind-reading kind
Well, you know and I know that love never runs on time

You're lost in the traffic
I've been asking around, but you haven't been seen
I never thought we were perfect
Oh, but darling - what we could have been!

The rain came and went all the next day
I pulled over sometime for a sleep on the side
Then I gunned it back out on the highway
Hit a big pot-hole and the radio came alive

Suicide blonde
Suicide blonde
Suicide blonde
Suicide blonde

Suicide blonde
Was the colour of her hair
Like a cheap distraction
For a new affair
She knew it would finish
Before it began
Something tells me you lost the plan

You want to make her
Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde
You want to make her
Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde

She stripped to the beat
But her clothes stay on
White light everywhere
But you can't see a thing
Such a squeeze
A mad sad moment
Glory to you
Glory to you
Take me there
Take me there

Got some revelation
Put into your hands
Save you from your misery
Like rain across the land
Don't you see
The colour of deception
Turning your world around again

You want to make her
Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde
You want to make her
Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde

Am I not pretty enough?
Is my heart too broken?
Do I cry too much?
Am I too outspoken?
Don't I make you laugh?
Should I try it harder?
Why do you see right through me?

I live, I breathe
I let it rain on me
I sleep, I wake
I try hard not to break

I crave, I love
I've waited long enough
I try as hard as I can

Am I not pretty enough?
Is my heart too broken?
Do I cry too much?
Am I too outspoken?
Don't I make you laugh?
Should I try it harder?
Why do you see right through me?

I laugh, I feel
I make believe it's real
I fall, I freeze
I pray down on my knees

I hope, I stand
I take it like a man
I try as hard as I can

Am I not pretty enough?
Is my heart too broken?
Do I cry too much?
Am I too outspoken?
Don't I make you laugh?
Should I try it harder?
Why do you see right through me?

Why do you see
Why do you see
Why do you see right through me?
Why do you see
Why do you see
Why do you see right through me?
Why do you see
Why do you see
Why do you see right through me?
Why do you see
Why do you see
Why do you see right through me?

All that I'm hearing from you
Is White Noise
All that I'm hearing from you
Is White Noise

If looks could kill
I'd be in trouble right now
Time stands still
When you're around

Well I gave you all my time,
And you gave me all your lies.
And you've just come around 
to say goodbye.

Now here we stand
With our hearts in our hands
Squeezing out all the life
All that I hear
Is a message, unclear
What else is there to decide?

All that I'm hearing from you
Is White Noise (White Noise)
White Noise (White Noise)
All that I'm hearing from you
Is White Noise (White Noise)
White Noise (White Noise)
White Noise

You promised me your soul
But then left me in the cold
No warning and without a reason

You're placing yourself 
in a world of mistrust,
Making excuses 
it's not you, it's us.
But how can something unspoken 
seem so loud.

And now

All that I'm hearing from you
Is White Noise (White Noise)
White Noise (White Noise)
All that I'm hearing from you
Is White Noise (White Noise)
White Noise (White Noise)

The operator comes on the line
Says hurry up man
'cos you ain't got much time
White Noise
White Noise

All that I'm hearing from you
Is White Noise
All that I'm hearing from you
Is White Noise
White Noise

White Noise (White Noise)
White Noise (White Noise)
All that I'm hearing from You
Is White Noise (White Noise)
White Noise (White Noise)
All that I'm hearing from You
Is White Noise (White Noise)
White Noise (White Noise)
All that I'm hearing from You
Is White Noise (White Noise)
White Noise (White Noise)
All that I'm hearing from You
When the sun sets over Carlton
And the moonlight floods the streets
All those pizza places and spaced out places
They all get on the beat

When the sun sets over Carlton
And the stars begin to shine
All those grey-haired writers and drunken fighters
They all step out in line

When the sun sets over Carlton
And the day begins to fade
All those night time junkies and long haired monkeys
They all pull up the shade

When the sun sets over Carlton
And the lights begin to glow
All those Divine Lighters and window wipers
They all put on a show

When the sun sets over Carlton
And you're out to make a deal
Check out who you're talkin' to
And make sure they are real

(rpt above verse)
Well Lygon Street's really got me beat
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Well Lygon Street's really got me down
'Cos I'm a poor boy on the wrong side of town

Do the Lygon Street Limbo
How low can you go-go

I Am An Island

Young hearts on Paradise Street, tumble down like poetry,

Oh my! I've got to fly, reach up and touch the sky,

Up and down with the party clowns,

Ballroom dancing in sequined gowns,

I get so confused searching for you babe,

How come you keep walking off that way?

Little darling this is the end,

I needed you like oxygen,

"I am an island", some sucker scrawled,

"I am an island" on a city wall;

Broadway walk the length and breadth,

I think I'm smoking myself to death,

You're bad for me, and bad for the soul,

I think I'm losing my self control,

I've got nothing but vacancy,

Crawling after you on my hands and knees,

I'm a coal car on a downhill track,

I don't know what I'll do if you don't come back.

Little darling, this is the end,

I needed you like oxygen,

"I am an island", some sucker scrawled,

"I am an island", on a city wall.

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your love is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your love is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about

Every night, every day
Just to be there in your arms
Won't you stay
Won't you lay
stay forever and ever and ever and ever

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your love is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about

There's a dark secret in me
Don't leave me locked in your heart
Set me free
Feel the need in me
Set me free
Stay forever
And ever and ever and ever

Yeah
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

I look around
Unsatisfied
At what they're giving me
Then I think
To myself
Is there someone else
Who feels the same as me?
Do you feel the same, baby?

When my back is broken
When the mountain moves away
All the dreams and promises
That we give
We give away

Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked, yeah

Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked, baby

Look ahead
But don't mix it up
Baby look ahead
To better days and better ways
Make peace with flesh and blood
Make peace with your love
Nothing more I could ask of you
But in the end this is the truth

When my back is broken
When the mountain moves away
All the dreams and promises
That we give
We give away

Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked

Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
I wandered the streets and the gay crowded places
Trying to forget you but somehow it seems
My thoughts ever stray to our last sweet embraces
Over the sea on the Island of Dreams

High in the sky is the bird on the wing
Please carry me with you
Far far away from the mad rushing crowd
Please carry me with you

Again I would wander where memories enfold me
There on the beautiful Island of Dreams

High in the sky is the bird on the wing
Please carry me with you
Far far away from the mad rushing crowd
Please carry me with you

Again I would wander where memories enfold me
There on the beautiful Island of Dreams
Far far away on the Island of Dreams
There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around that the colt from Old Regret had got away
And had joined the wild bush horses, he was worth a thousand pounds, so all the cracks had gathered to the fray
All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far had mustered at the homestead overnight
For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are and the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight

There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup and the old man with his hair as white as snow
But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up, he would go wherever horse or man could go
And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand, no better horseman ever held the reins
For never horse could throw him while the saddle-girths would stand and he learnt to ride while droving on the plains

And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast, he was something like a racehorse undersized
With a touch of Timor pony, three parts thoroughbred at least and such as are by mountain horsemen prized
He was hard and tough and wiry, just the sort that won't say die, there was courage in his quick impatient tread
And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye and the proud and lofty carriage of his head

But still so slight and weedy, one would doubt his power to stay and the old man said, that horse will never do
For a long and tiring gallop lad, you'd better stop away, those hills are far too rough for such as you
So he waited sad and wistful, only Clancy stood his friend, oh I think we ought to let him come, he said
And I warrant he'll be with us when he's wanted at the end, for both his horse and he are mountain bred

Oh he hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side, where the hills

He's just a local boy
Modelling for magazines
Nun-Chukka
Things are never quite as they seem
He's got throwing stars
He's got silver tops
Mama's grabbed her jewellery
Hidden in the bathroom
Calling the cops

Give me somewhere to go
Don't give me train rides
When the shops are all closed
Don't give me train rides

Never gave anyone the slightest notion
Never showed us that the call was cast
Mama don't want you
Daddy don't want you
Your Motor's running way too fast

Now the Mallway's shuttered
Hanging in the afternoon
Drink a little Vodka
Picking up the old man
Rolling him 'round in her room
Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya;
Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya;
Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya;
Oh, Lord, kumbaya

Someone's cryin', Lord, kumbaya;
Someone's cryin', Lord, kumbaya;
Someone's cryin', Lord, kumbaya;
Oh, Lord, kumbaya

Someone's singin', Lord, kumbaya;
Someone's singin', Lord, kumbaya;
Someone's singin', Lord, kumbaya;
Oh, Lord, kumbaya

Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya;
Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya;
Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya;
Oh, Lord, kumbaya
Kumbaya
Stir it up, little darlin' stir it up
Stir it up, little darlin' stir it up

It's been a long, long time
Since I had you on my mind
Now you are here with me it's so good to see
There's so much we could do, me and you

Now stir it up, little darlin' stir it up, yeah
Come on now stir it up, Little darlin', stir it up

I'll push the wood for you, light the fire;
Gonna satisfy your heart's desire
And I will stir it, stir it every every minute
All you got to do girl is keep me in it

Now stir it up, little darlin' stir it up, yeah
Come on now stir it up, Little darlin', stir it up, c'mon

It's been a long, long time
Since I had you on my mind
Now you are here with me it's so plain to see
There's so much we could do, me and you, c'mon

Stir it up, little darlin' stir it up, yeah
C'mon now stir it up, Little darlin', stir it up
C'mon now stir it up, stir it up
C'mon now stir it up, Little darlin', stir it up
C'mon
When I'm down, you're always there just to see me through
You understand everything that I do
It's not a wonder that I care for you

And so babe, it's only fair we should hold on tight
Please be careful just to follow the light
I promise everything will be alright

Oh, there ain't nothing sadder than missing so the one you love
And there ain't nothing truer than thoughts of love I'm thinking of

When you're down, I will be there, you can count on me
It's just so easy anyone can see it's not a wonder that you care for me

Oh, there ain't nothing sadder than missing so the one you love
And there ain't nothing truer than thoughts of love I'm thinking of

When I'm down, you're always there just to see me through
You understand everything that I do
It's not a wonder that I care for you
Oh no it's not a wonder that I care

Doing everything that I believe in
Going by the rules that I've been taught
More understanding of what's around me
And protected from the walls of love

All that you see is me
And all I truly believe

That I was born to try
I've learned to love
Be understanding
And believe in life
But you've got to make choices
Be wrong or right
Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like
But I was born to try

No point in talking of what should have been
And regretting the things that went on
Life's full of mistakes, destinies and fates
Remove the clouds, look at the bigger picture

And all that you see is me
And all I truly believe

That I was born to try
I've learned to love
Be understanding
And believe in life
But you've got to make choices
Be wrong or right
Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like
But I was born to try

All that you see is me
And all I truly believe
All that you see is me
And all I truly believe

That I was born to try
I've learned to love
Be understanding
And believe in life
But you've got to make choices
Be wrong or right
Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like
But I was born to try

[Outro]
But you've got to make choices
Be wrong or right
Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like
But I was born to try
I am tall and I am thin
of an enviable height
and I've been known to be quite handsome
from a certain angle and in a certain light

well I entered into O'Malley's
said: "O'Malley I have great thirst"
O'Malley merely smiled at me
said: "you wouldn't be the first"

I knocked on the bar and pointed
to a bottle on the shelf
and as O'Malley poured me out a drink
I sniffed and crossed myself

my hand decided that the time was nigh
and for a moment it slipped from view
and when it return it fairly burned
with confidence anew

well the thunder from my steely fist
made all the glasses jangle
when I shot him I was so handsome
it was the light it was the angle

huh! hmmmmmmmm

"neighbours!" I cried "friends" I screamed
and I banged my fist upon the bar
"I bear no grudge against you"
and my dick felt long and hard

"I am the man for which no God waits
but for which the whole world yearns
I'm marked by darkness and by blood
and one thousand powder-burns"

well you know those fish with the swollen lips
that clean the ocean floor?
when I looked at poor O'Malley's wife
well that's exactly what I saw

I jammed the barrel under her chin
and her face looked raw and vicious
her head it landed in the sink
with all the dirty dishes

her little daughter Siobhan
pulled beer from dusk till dawn
and amongst the townfolk she was a bit of a joke
but she pulled the best beer in town

I swooped magnificent upon her
as she sat shivering in her grief
like the Madonna painted on the church-house wall
in whale's blood and banana leaf

her throat it crumbled in my fist
and I spun heroically around
to see Caffrey rising from his chair
I shot that mother fucker down

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm yeah yeah yeah

"I have no free will" I sang
and I flew about the murder
Mrs. Richard Holmes, she screamed
you really should have heard her

I sang and I laughed, I howled and I wept
I panted like a pup
I blew a hole in Mrs. Richard Holmes
and her husband stupidly stood up

he screamed, "you are an evil man"
and I paused a while to wonder
"if I have no free will then how can I
be morally culpable, I wonder"

I shot Richard Homes in the stomach
gingerly he sat down
and he whispered weirdly, " no offence"
and then lay upon the ground

"none taken" I replied to him
to which he gave a little cough
with blazing wings I neatly aimed
blew his head completely off

I've lived in this town for thirty years
to no-one I am a stranger
and I put new bullets in my gun
chamber upon chamber

and when I turned my gun on the bird-like Mr. Brookes
I thought of Saint Francis and his sparrows
and as I shot the youthful Richardson
it was Sebastian I thought of, and his arrows

Hhhhhhhhhhh Mmmmmmmmmmmm

I said " I want to introduce myself
and I'm glad that you all came"
and I leapt upon the bar
and shouted out my name

well Jerry Bellows he hugged his stool
closed his eyes, shrugged and laughed
and with an ashtray big as a fucking really big brick
I split his skull in half

his blood spilled across the bar
like a steaming scarlet brook
and I knelt at it's edge on the counter
wiped the tears away and looked

well from the position I was standing
the strangest thing I ever saw
the bullet entered through the top of his chest
and blew his bowels out on the floor

well I floated down the counter
showing no remorse
I shot a hole in Kathleen Carpenter
recently divorced

but remorse I felt, remorse I had
it clung to everything
from the raven's hair upon my head
to the feathers on my wings

.....squeezed my hand in it's fraudulent claw
with it's golden hairless chest
and I glided through the bodies
and killed the fat man Vincent West

who sat quietly in his chair
a man become a child
and I raised the gun up to his head
executioner-style

he made no attempt to resist
so fat and dull and lazy
"do you know I lived in your street?" I cried
and he looked at me like I was crazy

"O" he said "I had no idea"
and he grew as quiet as a mouse
and the roar of the pistol when it went off
near blew the hat right off the house

well I caught my eye in the mirror
gave it a long and loving inspection
"there stands some kind of man" I roared
and there did in the reflection

my hair combed back like a raven's wing
my muscles hard and tight
and curling from the business end of my gun
was a query-mark of cordite

well I spun to the left, I spun to the right
and I spun to left again
"fear me! fear me!"
but no-one did cause they were dead

Huh! Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

and then there was the police sirens wailing
and a bull-horn squelched and blared
"drop your weapons and come on out
with you hands held in the air"

well I checked the chambers of my gun
saw I had one final bullet left
my hand it looked almost human
as I raised it bravely to my head

"drop your weapon and come on out!
keep your hands above your head!"
well I had one long hard think about dying
and did exactly what they said

there must have been fifty cops out there
in a circle around O'Malley's bar
"don't shoot" I cried "I'm a man unarmed"
so they put me in their car

and they sped me away from that terrible scene
and I glanced out of the window
saw O'Malley's bar saw the cops and the cars
and I started counting on my fingers

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah one
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa two
Aaaaaaaaaaa three Mmmmm four

O'Malley's bar O'Malley's bar

I can still recall the time
She said she was always mine
Then she left ( as people do ),
And forgets what we've been through
(Does this sound familiar to you ?)
It's not that she's gone away
It's the things I hear she has got to say
About me - and about my friends
When we've got no defence.

That's her: I'll never believe her again.
She might have deceived all my friends
I know they will see in the end
What it all means when she says (yeah!)
I want you back (She says)

But what's worse: she thinks it's true
But that's just her (she always was a little bit confused!)
She's not worth the time I had to lose
Dear John, so begins the famous old story
Goodbye, au-revoir, thanks for the memory
Keep it short and sweet if you really care

D-I-Vor-C-E can be so hurtful
It makes public property of things that are personal
All the friends and family get their share

Ink is black, as black as night
Black as thoughts that shun the light
Truth will out and maybe then
You'll put down that poison pen, that poison pen

Everyone enjoys sharing a rumour
But when it's aimed at you it loses its humour
Sometimes words so innocent cut so deep

That poison pen

Everybody's telling me, talk is cheap
Sometimes words so innocent, cut so deep
Cut so deep
They cut so deep
So deep

Ink is black (Ink is black)
As black as night, (as black as night)
Black as thoughts (black as thoughts)
That shun the light (that shun the light)

That poison pen
That poison pen
Poison pen

Black as night (ah)
As black as coal
Black as thoughts (ah)
That cast a shadow right across my soul
I thought that you were my friend
'Til you picked up that poison pen
That poison pen
Yeah

Poison

I've been to cities that never close down
From New York to Rio and old London town
But no matter how far or how wide I roam
I still call Australia home

I'm always traveling, I love being free
And so I keep leaving the sun and the sea
But my heart lies waiting over the foam
I still call Australia home

All the sons and daughters spinning 'round the world
Away from their family and friends
But as the world gets older and colder
It's good to know where your journey ends

But someday we'll all be together once more
When all of the ships come back to the shore
Then I realise something I've always known
I still call Australia home

(But no matter how far or wide I roam)
I still call Australia
I still call Australia
I still call Australia home

(But no matter how far or wide I roam)
Oh I still call Australia
I still call Australia
I still call Australia home

Jessie is a friend,
Yeah I know he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed
It ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl
And I want to make her mine
And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it!
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman like that?

I'll play along with this charade
There doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her but the point is probably moot
'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it!
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman like that?

Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman...
Why can't I find a woman like that?

And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been funny; I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?
Tell me why can't I find a woman like that?

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl

I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want, I want Jessie's girl
My edge is keen and I've honed my skill.
I've got nerves of steel and an iron will.
My skin is bronze, my trim is chrome,
Climb aboard - I'll drive you home.
I'm a silver - tongued devil with a heart of gold,
When I was made they broke the mould.
My blood runs hot, like molten lead,
Pump you full - I'm gonna knock you dead.
I don't mince words, I spit'em out.
I won't leave room for any doubt.
Get to the point, stop splitting hairs
That ain't getting either of us anywhere.
Sometimes it's better to be blunt
But is this some kind of publicity stunt?
So far you've whet my appetite,
Do you wanna grind with me tonight?
Axegrinder. I'm not famous for my tact.
Axegrinder. I've gotta sharpen up my act.
Axegrinder. Try and see things through my eyes.
Everything and everyone gets cut back down to size.
On the brink of who knows what?
We've gotta strike while the iron's hot.
l can hold your hand, try to guide you through
But I can't make your moves for you.
Swing my blade - that's how it's done.
Don't stop me now, I've only just begun.
I was told when I was young
I wouldn't work in an iron lung.
Now I've learned a trick of two.
I'm working up a sweat for you.

RUSH YOU 

Love is no fun anymore
There's too many things I can't afford
So what do you mean when you say
That she's your girlfriend today

I wouldn't ever wanna rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't wanna lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you

Love's not beating down on my door
I guess it's cause ooh, I got lucky, lucky before

I wouldn't ever wanna rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't wanna lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you

Wealth is boring without happiness
Fame is notorious for causing stress
Health is for binging on in between drinks
Money over matter for the rich in minks

I wouldn't ever wanna rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't wanna lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you

Never wanna rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't wanna lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you

Larry made his nest up in the autumn branches
Built from nothing but high hopes and thin air
He collected up some baby-blasted mothers, they took their chances
And for a while they lived quite happily up there

He came from New York City, man, but he couldn’t take the pace
He thought it was like dog eat dog world
Then he went to San Francisco, spent a year in outer space
With a sweet little San Fransiscan girl

I can hear my mother wailing and a whole lot of scraping of chairs
I don’t know what it is, but there’s definitely something going on upstairs

[Dig yourself]
[Laz’rus dig yourself]
[Laz’rus dig yourself]
[Laz’rus dig yourself]
(I want you to dig)

[Back in that hole]

(I want you to dig)

(I want you to dig)

Yeah, New York City, he had to get out there
And San Fransisco, well, I don't know
And then to L.A., where he spent about a day
He thought even the pale sky-stars were smart enough to keep well away from L.A.

Meanwhile Larry made up names for the ladies
Like miss Boo and miss Quick
He stockpiled weapons and took potshots in the air
He feasted on their lovely bodies like a lunatic
And wrapped himself up in their soft yellow hair

I can hear chants and incantations and some guy is mentioning me in his prayers
Well, I don’t know what it is, but there’s definitely something going on upstairs

[Dig yourself]
[Laz’rus dig yourself]
[Laz’rus dig yourself]
[Laz’rus dig yourself]
(I want you to dig)
[Back in that hole]

(I want you to dig)

(I want you to dig)

Well, New York City, man, San Francisco, LA, I don’t know
But Larry grew increasingly neurotic and obscene
I mean he, he never asked to be raised up from the tomb
I mean no one ever actually asked him to forsake his dreams

Anyway, to cut a long story short
Fame finally found him, mirrors became his torturers
Cameras snapped him at every chance
The women all went back to their homes and their husbands
With secret smiles in the corners of their mouths

He ended up like so many of them do, back on the streets of New York City
In a soup queue, a dopefiend, a slave, then prison, then the madhouse, then the grave
Ah, poor Larry

But what do we really know of the dead
And who actually cares?

Well, I don’t know what it is, but there’s definitely something going on upstairs

[Dig yourself]
[Laz’rus dig yourself]

Overnight scenes, dinner and wine
Saturday girls
I was never in love, never had the time
In my hustle and hurry world
Laughing myself to sleep
Waking up lonely
I needed someone to hold me oh-oh-oh

It's such a crazy old town
It can drag you down
Till you run out of dreams
So you party all night to the music and lights
And you don't know what happiness means
I was dancing in the dark with strangers
No love around me
When suddenly you found me oh-oh-oh

Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me
Oh girl...

Everything good, everything fine
That's what you are
So put your hand in mine
And together we'll climb
As high as the highest star
I'm living a lifetime in every minute
That we're together
And I'll stay right here forever oh-oh-oh

Singing along with your favourite song
You pull the covers around
I pay the price you know I sacrifice
You kick my head out of bounds

If I get set up, you get het up
Slow down
It's such a disgrace
But then we're so chaste
Baby

You've got your 8mm going
For your private showing
You never cease to astound
And readin' next week's papers
So you're wise to all the capers
You ain't a queen
But you still wear the crown

If I get set up, you get het up
Slow down
It's such a disgrace
But then we're so chaste

Baby
You just a baby
Gunna leave me just a take me..... away.... right now.. most definitely(?)

Singing along with your favourite song
You say I don't fit the mould
You're disillusioned but with no regrets
You've made my coffee go cold

If I get set up, you get het up
Slow down
It's such a disgrace
But then we're so chaste
Baby
You just a baby
Gunna leave me just a take me..... away.... right now.. most definitely(?)

My coffee's gone cold (oh baby)
My coffee's gone cold (oh baby oh baby)
My coffee's gone cold
My coffee's gone cold
My coffee's gone cold
My coffee's gone cold
My coffee's gone cold

Ask me questions, get no answers
Give me nothing, take no chances
Show me books with empty pages
Wind your clocks and read your gauges

Tell me truths that have no meaning
Live in rooms that have no ceiling
Now your friends are all departed
So your secret's closely guarded

Don't go walking out late at night
Bolt your door, lock your windows tight
Be much safer staying out of sight

You're just a shadow boxer
Shadow boxer
Shadow boxer

(Solo)

Don't go walking out late at night
Bolt your door, lock your windows tight
Be much safer staying out of sight
You might go down in a state of fright
Watch out when you're all alone
Locked inside your safety zone
You might find that you have turned to stone

I have my addiction, you say affliction
I say a small affair
It has become a habit
I can't break and I can't have it
Nothin' to compare
He gives me goose bumps, heart thumps
He makes my body jump, I rack my brain and tear my hair
He gives me heartbreak, guts aches
I shiver and I shake, I really nead intensive care
He has a cardiac arrestin' stare
Doctor I'm in trouble, seein' faint, feelin' double
I'm shortin' out of breath
Call up the pharmacy
Send a little help to me
I'm bein' loved, I'm bein' loved to death
He gives me goose bumps, heart thumps
He makes my body jump, I rack my brain and tear my hair
He gives me heartbreak, guts ache
I shiver and I shake, I really nead intensive care
He has a cardiac arrestin' stare
He gives me goose bumps, heart thumps
He makes my body jump, I rack my brain and tear my hair
He gives me heartbreak, guts ache
I shiver and I shake, I really nead intensive care
He has a cardiac arrestin' stare
Goose bumps, heart thumps
He'll make my body jump, I rack by brain and tear my hair
He gives me heartbreak, guts ache
I shiver and I shake, I really nead intensive care
He has a cardiac arrestin' stare
Goose bumps, heart thumps
He'll make my body jump, I rack my brain and tear my hair
He gives me heartbreak, guts ache
I shiver and I shake, I really nead intensive care
He has a cardiac arrestin' stare
Goose bumps, heart thumps
He'll make my body jump, I rack my brain and tear my hair [fade]

Every morning when I wake from my bed
I find I'm yawning just a'scratchin' my head
I face the dawning and I feel like I'm dead
I been sleeping all alone
Well every daybreak as I wake from my sleep
I find I'm aching as I drag from the deep
If I were a Mustang I'd be a junk yard heap
Mirror don't lie mirror don't lie
Talk about a rolling stone

Everybody said what's that sound
Put it in a skillet and a'slap it all around
And everybody said I can't stay home
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome

Well all these dragons are just a'draggin' me down
I've been picking things up from the underground
Like a trackless tram I'm Bondi bound
Sitting in the depot all alone
No purity no clear white walls
Just a big stampede when the Warragul calls
Times a'menacing just gnashes and mauls
Where'm I gonna buy it where'm I gonna buy it
Gotta give a dog a bone

I've been thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome

Well I've been living a catagorical lie
Each last thrill the penultimate high
Just one more hit before I can die
Yellow teeth are snappin' all around
Well every daybreak as I wake from my bed
I find I'm aching just a'scratchin' my head
If I were a Mustang I think it's gone to my head
Mirror don't lie mirror don't lie
Talk about a rolling stone

Everybody said what's that sound
Put it in a skillet and a'slap it all around
And everybody said I can't stay home
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Everybody said what's that sound
Put it in a skillet and a'slap it all around
And everybody said I can't stay home
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
I've been thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
There's no-one to call from a country town
It's not a bad thing
I don't have anyone lovely to call
And it's not a bad thing

I'm not doing the dirty, breaking a vow
I'm not a tomcat doing the rounds
And if I were there'd be no-one to complain

There's no-one worrying at home
Ringing to see if I'll answer the phone
Happy if after the show I'm alone

There's no-one to call from a country town
And say I got a tan
Or we played under the biggest pergola
This side of Japan

The mountains are hazy - the mist from the sea
Is it good luck for dolphins on the same wave as me?
Or, honey-child I miss you just same

There's no-one worrying at home
Ringing to see if I'll answer the phone
Happy if after the show I'm alone

It's strange to be happy if your boyfriend's lonely
But that's the way they are
It's strange to be happy if your girlfriend's lonely
But that's the way we are
But no-one's worrying at home

I don't need lots of people, tellin' me what to do
I don't need a long haired lady, to love me true as true
All I need is a rock'n'roll band...somewhere new to play
And I'm on my way, I'm on my way

I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, and I'm on the run
I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, I never needed anyone

My life isn't easy baby, it's the life that I need
I got music livin' inside of me, I gotta set it free
All I need is a rock'n'roll band...somewhere new to play
And I'm on my way, I'm on my way

I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, and I'm on the run
I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, I never needed anyone

Playin' music babe, is all I know
Where it wants to take me honey...

All I want from livin' is just to be left alone
All I need is an open road, 'cause I'm a rollin' stone
All I need is a rock'n'roll band...somewhere new to play
And I'm on my way, I'm on my way

I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, and I'm on the run
I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, I never needed anyone

I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, and I'm on the run
I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, momma I don't need no one

I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, and I'm on the run
I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, I never needed anyone
Raggin' raggin' red red raggin'
Raggin' raggin' red red raggin'
Raggin' raggin' red red raggin' raggin'
Working man's, it's a living wage
Workin woman, equal pay
No stinking poverty
When you're creaking with age
Ask for these, and all the bosses say is

You're raggin' raggin' red red raggin'
Raggin' raggin' red red raggin'
Raggin' raggin' red red raggin'
Commos to a man
Well if that's being commo
It's commo where we stand

Proud black nation gives a long black shout
Strong black art, Strong black mouth
Two hundred years too long to die
But you spit it all out and the white boss cries

You're raggin' raggin' red red raggin'
Raggin' raggin' red red raggin'
Raggin' raggin' red red raggin'
Commos to a man
Well if that's being commo
It's commo where we stand

Sixty hours to kill on that endless line
Sixty hours cause you're the factory swine
Long long weeks and your brain drags down
Long long years and your backbone's gone

It's time for raggin' raggin' red red raggin'
Raggin' raggin' red red raggin'
Raggin' raggin' red red raggin'

Sell your guts at the boss' price
He pays cash but you pay for your life
There's women and men standing up to their feet
While the boss pulls a knife and groans through his teeth

You're raggin' raggin' red red raggin'
Raggin' raggin' red red raggin'
Raggin' raggin' red red raggin'

We were dead on arrival,
Safe home at last.
Not cannon fire dockside,
No flags half-mast.
We were sold out for silver
And a string of black pearls
On the loneliest island
At the edge of the world.

Like destiny's children,
Souls lost at sea.
No room on the lifeboat, you can hold on to me.
Hold on to me, hold on to me.

Now the voyage is over,
We're back on dry land.
In our eyes are the stories,
The rope and the brand.

Like destiny's children,
souls lost at sea.
No room on the lifeboat, you can hold on to me.
Hold on to me, hold on to me.
Hold on to me, hold on to me, hold on to me.

We were dead on arrival,
Safe home at last.
Not cannon fire dockside,
No flags half-mast.
We were sold out for silver,
And a string of black pearls.
On the loneliest island,
At the edge of the world.

Hold on to me, hold on to me.
Hold on to me, hold on to me, hold on to me.

If half of what I'm saying, think what I'm saying is true
Will you rub my head, make it all shiny and new?
And you drag my coat tails, drag my coat tails down
And I'll be the only cold-assed king around

If you wait, I'll give all my aches to you
Take the chance to ignore what you're going through
My cold hand is there for you to take
(If you leave, can I fall down?)
And I'm your Berlin chair, won't you lean on me 'til I break?

I'll ignore each golden dragging kiss you can give
On the blankest face that you ever had to forgive
If you see my fallings, see my failings through
I'm the re-run that you'll always force yourself to sit through

If you wait, I'll give all my aches to you
Take the chance to ignore what you're going through
My cold hand is there for you to take
(If you leave, can I fall down?)
And I'm your Berlin chair, won't you lean on me 'til I break?

[Outro]
Well, you're too late
You're too late
You're too late
You're too late
Over the airwaves tonight
Sailing by a love lonely light
Isn't it blue, but isn't it brighter
Than the pilot of a domestic flight

Well under this low, lonely light
I might be still in sight
You were a girl, now you're a wife
Do not these memories stir you
From your long and peaceful night's

Sleep in perfection
Asleep in Perfection

A soul's misdirection, directed at you

Waiting for Summer to come
Will you wear a rainbow on
And outside your window something grows
In your garden, is it content
Well that's not what I need tonight
Maybe I don't think right
Or maybe I lack that insight
And only the numb or the peaceful might

Sleep in perfection
Asleep in Perfection

A soul's misdirection directed at you

Over the airwaves tonight
Sailing by a love lonely light
Isn't it blue, or is it the sight of you
Set to fall

Asleep in Perfection

I got to keep moving to stay warm
Cause I'm freezing in this room
And if I prove no good here
I'll skip to where I should
It's only an imaginary
Vigil that we keep
You salvage what you need
I'll take the love you leave

I love your way
I can't explain
What made me change

I'm wading in deeper ever deeper as I go
I drown the whole idea as I drift away from you
It's only an imaginary vigil that we keep
You salvage what you need I'll take the love you leave

I love your way
I can't explain
What made me change
I love your way

And as the memory gathers dust
Buried in its crust
Are the remains of what we've done
And the seeds of what we just begun
The tapping of the rain
Beats a corrugated drum
And the city glow well it pulses on to the city hum

And as the memory gathers dust
Buried in its crust
Are the remains of what we've done
And the seeds of what we just begun
The tapping of the rain
Beats a corrugated drum
And the city glow well it pulses on 'till the day is done

I love your way
I can't explain
What made me change
Walks like a crooked tooth
And sleeps with a dexedrine smile
Keeps finding the holes where old memory can go
And wash it down liquefied

Keep that old door swinging
Coz you can be the freeloader
When it's closing time
When it's closing time

Watcha gonna do it's nothing to see
But something's got ya down on your knees
I'm crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts
And it ain't falling down by degrees
I think I'm gonna die
From trying to kick a hole in the sky

Yer walls are plastered with ham-fist drunks
And fagans wrapped in denim and smoke
So tell me what chance did you happen to dance
With the step that kicked yer feet in the boat

Loose band on the radio
All static and clashin' a hob-nailed hint
You're never losing ground
It's just the way it sounds

Watcha gonna do it's nothing to see
But something's got ya down on your knees
I'm crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts
And it ain't falling down by degrees
I think I'm gonna die
From trying to kick a hole in the sky
Trying to kick a hole in the sky
Trying to kick a hole in the sky

You cover me like the sunshine kisses the day
But a pulse starts in my gut now
And it's gonna make us pay

Watcha gonna do it's nothing to see
But something's got ya down on your knees
I'm crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts
And it ain't falling down by degrees
I think I'm gonna die
From trying to kick a hole in the sky
Trying to kick a hole in the sky
Trying to kick a hole in the sky
Ah bring it on

Memories are fading
A single voice complaining
Days are stacking up
It's hardly worth debating
The people are frustrated
Drink from poison cup
The system is collapsing
Conscience is relapsing
The damage has been done

On the day you come rising up
On the day you come rising up

Vision is rejected
The people's choice is tested
So ignorance has won
Children are infected
Remedy suggested
Don't drink from tainted cup
Overpopulation
Media sensation
The damage has been done

On the day you come rising up
On the day you come rising up
Well I'm on my way to heaven
We shall not be moved
On my way to heaven
We shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's standing by the water side
We shall not be moved

We shall not we shall not be moved
We shall not we shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's standing by the water side
We shall not be moved

On the road to freedom

We shall not be moved
On the road to freedom
We shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's standing by the water side
We shall not be moved

We shall not we shall not be moved
We shall not we shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's standing by the water side
We shall not be moved

We're brothers together
We shall not be moved
We're brothers together
We shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's standing by the water side
We shall not be moved

We shall not we shall not be moved
We shall not we shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's standing by the water side
We shall not be moved

Standing on the outside, I don't know where I'm going to
But I do know-ow just one thing, and that is it's over with you

I've been very lonely, I did not think I could go on
I was caught, in mem'ries-ies, and dreams I should have won

Blind Freddy knew that, a blind man could see
I was in love with you, but you weren't in love with me

Suppose I'll have to keep it, keep it inside, I don't know why
Well I know, that it won't change it, but baby, it helps if I cry

Blind Freddy knew that, a blind man could see
I was in love with you (in love with you)
But you weren't in love with me

It used to be so perfect (so perfect)
It used to be so perfect (so perfect)
In lovin' you (used to be so perfect lovin' you)
It used to be so perfect, it used to be so perfect
In lovin' you (used to be so perfect)

So now I'm standing on the outside, I don't know where I'm going to
But I do know just one thing, and that is it's over with you

Blind Freddy knew that, a blind man could see
I was in love with you (in love with you)
But you weren't in love with me

Blind Freddy knew that, yes he knew it
A blind man could see, yes he could, yes he could
I was in love with you (in love with you)
But you weren't in love with me (you weren't in love with me)
My baby's not in lo-hove (you weren't in love with me)
Weren't in love, weren't in love (you weren't in love with me)
My baby's not in love (you weren't in love with me)
Weren't in love, weren't in love (you weren't in love with me)
Weren't in love, weren't in love (you weren't in love with me)
When I'm lost in a strange place
Scared and alone
When I'm wishing for home
That's when I think of you

When the load gets to heavy
Too much to bear
When I'm going nowhere
There's no one there
And I'm feeling like a fool

That's when I think of you
It's all that I can do
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you

When I'm caught in the crossfire
Of wrongs making right
When I wake in the night
That's when I think of you

When I'm halfway to heaven
With three parts of hell
And its all just as well
That I can't even tell
And I'm lost without a clue

If not for the thought of you
The promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you

When I'm a long way from loving
So far from home
When it feels like I'm in the twilight zone
And I just can't make it thru

If not for the thought of you
The promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you

I'm always thinking of you
It's all that I can do
I'd go mad not being with you
If not for the thought of
Promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad not being with you

Gonna write you a letter
Gonna mail it today-ay
So you won't escape from
These things I wanna say

I wanna thank you for the privelege
I-I wanna thank you for the pain
I'll be handin' you the ashes
I wanna thank you for-or the game

We stood on the balcony
And we watched it toge-ether
We were modern men and women
Who changed like the wea-eather

We were one day goin' hot, the next day goin' cold
One day growin' restless, the next day growin' old

Waiting for the countdown, in the summer of '81
Sign up or go underground, in the summer of '81

There's no time for leather
And there's no one on the floor
So I'll pretend that we're together
I don't want to go alone, no-no-no-no

We stood on the balcony
And we watched it toge-ether
We were modern men and women
Who changed like the wea-eather

We were one day goin' hot, the next day goin' cold
One day growin' restless, the next day growin' old

Waiting for the countdown, in the summer of '81
Sign up or go underground, in the summer of '81
We were waiting for the countdown, in the summer of '81
Sign up or go underground, in the summer of '81
Well we were waiting for the countdown in the summer of '81
Waiting for the countdown in the summer of '81
Waiting for the countdown in the summer of '81
Waiting for the countdown, in the summer of '81
You made me hard, you made me cold
I was simple, but now I know

Nobody wants to be the weak one
We all want to go from strength to strength

You made me hard, you made me strong
I was simple but not for long

Nobody wants to be the weak one
We all want to go from strength to strength
If I could go back in time, well I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't change a thing

I brought to you a kind disposition
You led me on and you rejected me
It took a while but I've accepted
I learnt a slow and painful lesson

You made me hard, you made me strong
I was simple but not for long

I wonder what you find so attractive
I've never seen you looking this excited
So let's just leave it at one third each
'Cause we both want something so far out of reach

You made me hard, you made me cold
I was simple but now I know
Now I know

I got a letter from my old mate he's in Zimbabwe
True white Mzungu dodging all the rifles of Obote
He's in the desert but he don't mind
He crawl 'cross Africa with cockroach breath

I got a letter from my old mate
He's in Zimbabwe

A Mongo on the Congo
The drums the drums of independence
Rhodesia oh Zambesi
They fight they fight for their descendants
He's in the dance halls but he don't mind
He dance 'cross Africa with Amin death

I got a letter from my old mate
He's in Zimbabwe

He's in the dance halls but he don't mind
He dance 'cross Africa with Amin death

I got a letter from my old mate
He's in Zimbabwe

Mozambique to Madagascar
On the fishing boat going troppo
My old Nigeria -- white is right
Past the Limpopo
He's in the jungle but he don't mind
He race 'cross Africa like Livingstone

I got a letter from my old mate
He's in Zimbabwe
I hope it gets better for my old mate
He's in Zimbabweeeh
I got a letter
I got a letter
I got a letter
I got a letter
I got a letter
I got a letter
Zimbabwe

Let's not forget last night
Yeah, how we drove along the Yarra
How we sang harmonies
To Carole King

These three years now just gone
They are the legends of my mind
We both kneel at these rocks
To drink of the mem'ry

You are the tunes in my head, the fire in my ribs
You are the voice in my heart that whispers compassion
Happy birthday Helen
Oh-oh..., oh-oh..., oh-oh...

We kissed on that bridge that fell down
While we held hands at the Taj
We've been stuck in a cave
With that bloke who says Oi Am

And when I cried for my cruel heart
You rubbed my back 'til I felt better
We ate bread on the lake
And yearned for the seasons

You are the tunes in my head, the fire in my ribs
You are the voice in my heart that whispers compassion
Happy birthday Helen
Oh-oh..., oh-oh..., oh-oh...

You are the tunes in my head, the fire in my ribs
You are the voice in my heart that whispers compassion

You are the storm on the ocean, poems in the trees
The smell of the winter that haunts me each autumn
You're my everything
You are my everything
You are my everything
Happy Birthday Helen
Oh-oh..., oh-oh..., oh-oh...
Shake

Oh-oh..., oh-oh..., oh-oh...
Oh-oh..., oh-oh..., oh-oh...
Happy birthday Helen

Sally called, when she got the word
She said "I suppose you've heard about Alice"
Well, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside
And I could hardly believe my eyes
This big limousine pulled slowly into Alice's drive 

Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice 

Grew up together, two kids in the park
Carved our initials deep in the bark me and Alice
Now she walks to the door, with her head held high
Just for a moment, I caught her eye
As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive 

Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice 

Sally called back, and asked how I felt
She said "I know how to help, you get over Alice"
She said "Now Alice is gone, but I'm still here
You know I've been waiting twenty four years"
And the big limousine disappeared 

I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance
Now I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice 
No, I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice
I've got a new apartment baby
And it protects me from the lonely whistling streets
And I've got a new apartment baby
The interior colour is red
And my only friend is my stereo receiver
Playing my favourite song all night long
Ahh
I've got a new apartment baby
Interior colour of red
And I see a new appointment maybe
Advertised for me
And I've got a new singer and I've got a new song x2
And I wistle along
All night long
Is she coming?
I've got a new apartment baby
And it protects me from the whistling streets
And I got a new singer and I got a new song
I did not advertise a singer, I did not advertise this song
But I whistle along
Is she coming?
And I've got good accomodation and I stay in all the time
Watch a horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie right there on my TV
Shockin' me right outa my brain

It's bound to get ya in
Get right under your skin
Hit you right on the chin - oh yeah

The cars are a-smashin
The cops are a-bashin - oh yeah
The kids are a-fightin
The fires are a-lightin

And they're all actors and fake old scenes
Maybe you don't care who's gonna lose or win
Listen to this and I'll tell you somethin'

It's a horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie and it's blown a fuse
Horror movie, it's the six-thirty news

Between the firin and the yellin
And you believe in what they're tellin - oh yeah
I live in a town called Millhaven
And it's small and it's mean and it's cold
But if you come around just as the sun goes down
You can watch the whole thing turn to gold
It's around about then that I used to go a-roaming
La la la la La la la lie
All God's children they all gotta die

My name is Loretta but I prefer it Lottie
I'm closing in on my fifteenth year
If you think you have seen a pair of eyes more green
Then you sure haven't see them around here
Well my hair is a-yellow and I'm always a-combed
La la la la La la la lie
Mama often told me that we all got to die

You must have heard about The Curse Of Millhaven
How last Christmas Bill Blake's little boy didn't come home
They found him the next week in One Mile Creek
His head bashed in and his pockets full of stones
Well, just imagine all the wailing and moaning
La la la la La la la lie
Even Billy Blake's boy, he had to die

Then Professor O'Rye from Millhaven High
Found nailed to his door his prize-winning terrier
Then next day the old fool brought little Biko to school
And we all had to watch as he buried her
Well his eulogy to Biko had all the tears flowing
La la la la La la la lie
Even God's little creatures, they have to die

Our little town fell into a state of shock
A lot of people were saying things that made little sense
Then the next thing you know the head of Handyman Joe
Was found in the fountain of the Mayor's residence
Well foul play can really get a small town going
La la la la La la la lie
Even God's children they have to die

Then, in a cruel twist of fate, old Mrs Colgate
Was stabbed but the job was not complete
Well the last thing she said before the cops pronounced her dead
Was, &amp;quot;My killer is Loretta and she lives across the street!&amp;quot;
Twenty cops burst through my door without even phoning
La la la la La la la lie
The young ones, the old ones, they all gotta die

Yes, it is I, Lottie. The Curse Of Millhaven
I've struck horror in the heart of this town
Like my eyes ain't green and my hair ain't yellow
It's more like the other way around
I gotta pretty little mouth underneath all the foaming
La la la la La la la lie
Sooner or later we all gotta die

Since I was no bigger than a weavil they've been saying I was evil
That if &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; was a boot that I'd fit it
That I'm a wicked young lady, but I've been trying hard lately
O fuck it! I'm a monster! I admit it!
Well it makes me so mad that my blood really starts a-going
La la la la La la la lie
Mama always told me that we all gotta die

Yeah, I drowned the Blakey kid, stabbed Mrs. Colgate, I admit
Did the handyman with his circular saw in his garden shed
But I never crucified little Biko, that was two junior high school psychos
Stinky Bohoon and his friend with the pumpkin-sized head
I'll sing to the lot, now you got me going
La la la la La la la lie
All God's children have all gotta die

Than there are all of the others, all our sisters and brothers
You assumed were accidents, best forgotten
Recall the children who broke through the ice on Lake Tahoo?
Everyone assumed the &amp;quot;Warning&amp;quot; signs had followed them to the bottom
Well, they're underneath the house where I do quite a bit of stowing
La la la la La la la lie
Even twenty little children, they had to die

And the fire of '91 that razed the Bella Vista slum
That was the biggest shit-fight this country's ever seen
Insurance companies ruined, land lords getting sued
All cause of wee little girl with a can of gasoline
Those flames really roared when the wind started blowing
La la la la La la la lie
Well the rich man, and the poor man, they all got to die

Well I confessed to all these crimes and they put me on trial
I was laughing when they took me away
Off to the asylum in an old black Mariah
Well it ain't home, but you know, it's better than jail
It ain't such bad old place to happy home in
La la la la La la la lie
All God's children they all gotta die

Now I got shrinks that will not rest with their endless Rorschach tests
I keep telling them that I think they're out to get me
They ask me if I feel remorse and I answer, &amp;quot;Why of course!
There's so much more I could've done if they'd let me!&amp;quot;
So it's Rorschach and Prozac and everything is groovy
Singing La la la la La la la lie
All God's children they all have to die
La la la la La la la lie
I'm happy as a lark now and everything is fine
Singing La la la la La la la lie
Yeah, everything is groovy and everything is fine
Singing La la la la La la la lie
All God's children they gotta die

I need your body
I got to have your body

You whisper my name and I feel my heart

And the wind cries out

Close to me
Such a temptation
A burning new sensation's
Flowing through me

You keep me reaching out for more

And the wind cries out
Out your name to me
And I feel no shame
Feeling this way

I need your body
I got to have your body
Close to me
Such a temptation
A burning new sensation
Flowing through me

Cos' peoples runnin' wild
See how we kick it in a brand new style

Everyone I know is going to my show-

Take me downtown

I'm not the kind of girl, who's scared of you at all cause

I see you watching me watching you
I see you watching me watching ? ROCK!

(I keep falling over)

My overcoat is hung and I'm too far gone to see
When the last drinks bell is rung you can carry me
Carry me

Carry me, push me through the door
Shovel me up when I'm sinking to this tear stained floor
Carry me

And sometimes I go over
Over the bar I'll go
Sometimes the pole is only one inch short

And sometimes I go over and you get me on a barrel
And your careful and your loving hands get caught
So carry me
Carry me

But I'm sorry if I showed you
How to lift this truck up off the ground
Yeah I'm not sorry if I moved ten tonnes or more

And I'm not sorry if I showed you how to wriggle round and round
As long as you could push me through the door

So if my overcoat is hung and I'm too far gone to see
And the last drinks bell is rung you can carry me
Carry me

Looking like a choirgirl
Crying like a refugee
Looking like a choirgirl
Crying like a refugee
One nurse to hold her
One nurse to wheel her down
The corridors of heeling
And I've been trying
But she's crying like a refugee

Loves me like a sister
Loves me like an only child
Loves me like a sister
Loves me like an only child
She's my connection
I'll hold on
And never, never, never let her down
Cause she's alone
And she loves me like an only child

Suffer little children
Send that little child to me
All day the doctor
Handles his responsibility

Looking like a choirgirl
Crying like a refugee
Looking like a choirgirl
Crying like a refugee
She's my connection
I'll hold on
And never, never, never let her down
Cause she's alone
And she's crying like a refugee
Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know there's
Just no getting over you

You know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But baby can't you see there's nothing left for me to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's no way to hide
Since you pushed my heart aside
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying fool forget him
My heart is saying don't let go
Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's no way to hide
Since you pushed my heart aside
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

Say I'm crying
I'm looking at what's on T.V.
Pain and suffering
And the struggle
To be free

It can't ever be denied and I
Never will ignore
But when I see you coming
I can take it all 

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems disappear
All the problems
All the fears
And the world seems disappear 

Say you're mine
And give yourself to the
Feelings that you know
I'm needing
All that you can give me
All the things
That you do so well
Words are healing
Sweet anticipation
Making spells
As the shadows close in
Fall across all our yesterdays 

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems
All the fears
And the world seems to disappear 

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems
All the fears
And the world seems to disappear 

Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear 

Say if I could
Look into myself and reason
But I could never never see or
Make sense of the dealings
Turn around
Am I looking at salvation
Make me realise all that I am
You put the light inside this man 

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems
All the fears
And the world seems to disappear 

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems
All the fears
And the world seems to disappear 

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems
All the fears
And the world seems to disappear 

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems
All the fears
Sometimes when this place gets kind of empty
Sound of their breath fades with the light
I think about the loveless fascination
Under the Milky Way tonight

Lower the curtain down on Memphis
Lower the curtain down all right
I got no time for private consultation
Under the Milky Way tonight

Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find

And it's something quite peculiar
Something shimmering and white
Leads you here despite your destination
Under the Milky Way tonight

Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find

And it's something quite peculiar
Something shimmering and white
Leads you here despite your destination
Under the Milky Way tonight

Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find

Under the Milky Way tonight
Under the Milky Way tonight
Under the Milky Way tonight
Say goodbye my own true lover
As we sing a lovers song
How it breaks my heart to leave you
Now the carnival is gone

High above the dawn is waiting
And my tears are falling rain
For the carnival is over
We may never meet again

Like a drum, my heart was beating
And your kiss was sweet as wine
But the joys of love are fleeting
For Pierrot and Columbine

Now the harbour light is calling
This will be our last goodbye
Though the carnival is over
I will love you till I die

Like a drum, my heart was beating
And your kiss was sweet as wine
But the joys of love are fleeting
For Pierrot and Columbine

Now the harbour light is calling
This will be our last goodbye
Though the carnival is over
I will love you till I die
Though the carnival is over
I will love you till I die

Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey hey

Staring out through the cracks and dirt
Watch it trinkle watch it overflow
Gain momentum swallow simple life
Never want it never want you around now

I live in a home now is it a home
I'll protect you I'll protect you
Still protect you
'Cause people in this town keep staring at the mighty wall

Great wall
Hold back desire still comfort me
Great wall
Don't tear it down around my feet

Hey hey hey

Kiss my cheeks so the children don't know
Fight desire fight it blow by blow
You had a heart now show me your heart
'Cause people in this town keep staring at the mighty wall

Great wall
Hold back desire still comfort me
Great wall
It's tracking on now can't you see

Great wall
Hold back desire still damp my fear
Great wall
Do come again I need you here

Great wall
Great wall

Hey hey
Hey hey hey

I'll protect you I'll protect you
Still protect you
People in this town keep staring at the mighty wall

Great wall
Hold back desire still comfort me
Great wall
Do tumble down around my feet

Great wall
Hold back desire still damp my fear
Great wall
Do come again I need you here
I need you here

Great wall
Great wall
Great wall

Hey hey
Lover, lover, why do you push?
Why do you push? Why do you push?
Baby baby, did you forget about me?

I've been standing at the back of your life
Back row centre just above the ice
Please don't ask me how I've been getting off
No, please don't ask me how I've been getting off

Break my body, with the back of your hand
Doesn't make sense from where I stand
Baby, baby why you wanna mess it up
Sooner or later I'll find my place
Find my body better fix my face
Please don't ask me
How I've been getting off
No, please don't ask me
How I've been getting off

It's a fine line between pleasure and pain
You've done it once you can do it again
Whatever you done don't' try to explain
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain
It's all the same

Sooner or later I'll find my place
Find my body better fix my face
Please don't ask me
How I've been getting off
Ah, now please don't ask me
How I've been getting off

It's a fine line between pleasure and pain
You've done it once you can do it again
Whatever you done don't' try to explain
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain
Pleasure and pain
You've done it once you can do it again
Whatever you done don't' try to explain
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain
It's all the same
You've done it once you can do it again
Whatever you done don't' try to explain
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain
Pleasure and pain
You've done it once you can do it again
Whatever you done don't' try to explain
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain
Pleasure and pain
You've done it once you can do it again
Whatever you done don't' try to explain
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain
Pleasure and pain
You've done it once you can do it again
Whatever you done don't' try to explain
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain
Thirty days in the county jail
Let me out and I just wanted to wail
Some fool tried to hold me down
I got drunk and I ripped up the town

I'm a bad boy...a bad boy for love
I'm a bad boy...a bad boy for love

Well I...I went around just to see my chick
I found her room and it was candle lit
She's makin' love to another man
I shot 'em both and they locked me in the slam

I'm a bad boy...a bad boy for love
I'm a bad boy...a bad boy for love

Mmm bad...so bad

Well I...I heard the the word there was a local break
It was a chance I just had to take
I jumped the wall and I was on the run
They came after me with a thousand guns

'Cause I'm a bad boy...a bad boy for love
I'm a bad boy...a bad boy for love

Yeah I'm a bad boy...a bad boy for love
Yeah I'm a bad boy...a bad boy for love

Honey I'm bad...thirty years mama
In the county jail...
Yonder she’s walking
She comes my way
Red dress on
Her long black hair
Talkin’ like
Walkin’ like
Walkin’ like
She comes to me

Oh baby I love you so
I need you now
I want you back
I can’t go on...

Helpless baby
Evil child
I’ve known you well and if you wanna stay that’s alright
You want me again
And then and you come to me
Well, that’s, that’s alright! That’s alright! That’s alright!

Now she’s gone
She’s walkin’ away
Red dress on
Her long black hair
I love her so
But now she’ll come runnin’
Anytime I say
Well that’s alright

Oh baby I love you so
I want you back
I need you now
I can’t go on...

Oh baby I want you back
I need you now
I love you so
I can’t go on...

Your world is as cold as ice, your world is so nice
But you don't want me arou-ound
Your world is a barren place, that look upon your face
Says you don't want me arou-ound
I might break into your coo-ool world
Break into your coo-ool world
I'll break into your-our coo-ool, coo-ool, coo-ool wor-orld
In your world there are no regrets, your goals have all been set
There are no more to be fou-ound
Your world is so well controlled, you will not be told
You know you don't hear a sou-ound
It might break into your coo-ool world
Break into your coo-ool world
Break into your-our coo-ool, coo-ool, coo-ool wor-orld
Somewhere way down deep inside, passion burned so bright
And walls are shakin'
In the tunnel deep and wide our two worlds will collide
If I am no-ot mista-aken
Cool and calm your world may be, but why do you believe
That you don't want me arou-ound
Well, I can touch you in a way, that you'll cease to say
That you don't want me arou-ound
I will break into your coo-ool world
Break into your coo-ool world
I'll break into your-our coo-ool, coo-ool, coo-ool wor-orld
I will break into your coo-ool world
I'll break into your coo-ool world
I'll break into your-our coo-ool, coo-ool, coo-ool wor-orld
'Cause your so-o, your so-so coo-ool
It's such a cool-cool wor-orld
Break in, break in, aghh, coo-ool world
Break in, oh-ho-ho-ho, coo-ool world
I'll break into your-our coo-ool, coo-ool, coo-ool wor-orld
Yes I will break into your coo-ool world
Break into your-our coo-ool world
Break into your coo-ool, coo-ool, coo-ool wor-orld (fade)

They built this house from tall timber
Cut it down in the mountain air
Building dreams in the city
Kept on going till the hills were bare

They came along with their axes
Brought their trucks and chainsaws too
And they cut down all that tall tall timber
Tall timber for me and you

She was a young girl, she was a hero
Stood on the stage, the people cheered
But the critics cut her down to zero
Because she sang the words that they all feared

And they came with their axes
They brought their knives and opinions too
And they cut her down like tall tall timber
Tall timber in the mountain dew

Please, don't cut down the tall timber
Let it grow tall straight and true
In this world we need tall tall timber
Tall timber like me and you

He was a young man with a dream
To bring freedom to his land
Shared his voice with his brothers
In those Chinese streets he made a stand

And they came with their soldiers
They brought their tanks and machine guns too
And they cut down all that tall tall timber
Tall timber like me and you

Please, don't cut down the tall timber
Let it grow tall straight and true
In this world we need tall tall timber
Tall timber like me and you

Please, don't cut down the tall timber
Let it grow tall straight and true
In this world we need tall tall timber
Tall timber like me and you

The redgum and the kauri
The eucalypt and pine
The poets and the painters
The thinkers of the time

Don't cut down the timber or we'll be forever poor
Don't kill off our heroes or we'll never win the war

Now the sun's so strong that it burns my eyes
The air's so bad that I can't breathe
The winter's warmer, the summer's hotter
I drive for miles and I don't see trees

And they came with their axes
They brought their knives and chainsaws too
And they cut down all that tall tall timber
Tall timber in the mountain dew

Please, don't cut down the tall timber
Let it grow tall straight and true
In this world we need tall tall timber
Tall timber like me and you

Please, don't cut down the tall timber
Let it grow tall straight and true
In this world we need tall tall timber
Tall timber like me and you
Tall timber like me and you

Please, don't cut down the tall timber
Let it grow tall straight and true
In this world we need tall tall timber
Tall timber like me and you

Please, don't cut down the tall timber
Let it grow tall straight and true
In this world we need tall tall timber
Tall timber like me and you
Gotta keep my nose to the grindstone
I gotta keep my foot to the floor
Gotta make it while the sun still shines
Gotta swim until I reach the other shore
Gotta keep my back to the window
While the clock is still keeping score
Gotta keep my head down
Gotta keep the preasure
Gotta keep the wolves from the door
Gotta make a mountain from a mole hile
I never worked so hard before
Yeah I gotta get to you before the sun goes down
I can't help it
Yeah I gotta get to you before the sun goes down
I can't help it

Gotta hold a hammer to the coal face
Gotta follow that seam to the core
I gotta journey to the center of the Earth
Cause I can't stand still anymore
If I'm still in one piece when I make it
It will be a miracle for sure
Yeah I gotta get to you before the sun goes down
I can't help it
Yeah I gotta get to you before the sun goes down
I can't help it

Gotta grind this stone into powder
Gotta break every brick in the wall
I got see the light
Gotta see this prison crumble
Gotta see the watch towers fall

I gotta be my own judge and jury
But when you speak
I gotta answer the call
Yeah I've gotta set a course for the setting sun
I've gotta break out of here
Yeah I've got to run
I've got to go home until I'm black and blue
I can't help it

I've gotta get to you before the sun goes down
I've gotta get to you before the sun goes down
Before the sun goes down
Are you so cold, lonely and old?
Are you in company? Could you talk to me?
Is it the least that I can do is when you leave to hold the door?

And at the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over, over?
At the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over?

And am I so sold, lonely and old?
Am I in company? Could you talk to me?
Is it the least that I can do is when you leave to hold the door?

And at the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over, over?
At the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over?

Or is it all in my imagination?

It's the end of my ride
It's a slow suicide
And it's over

Am I in company? Can't you talk to me?
Is it the least that I can do is when you leave to hold the door?

And at the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over, over?
At the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over, over?
And at the end of your ride
Who gets to decide when it's over?

Or is it all in my imagination?

It's the end of my ride
It's a slow suicide
And it's over
I don't believe in an interventionist God
But I know, darling, that you do
But if I did I would kneel down and ask Him
Not to intervene when it came to you
Not to touch a hair on your head
To leave you as you are
And if He felt He had to direct you
Then direct you into my arms

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms

And I don't believe in the existence of angels
But looking at you I wonder if that's true
But if I did I would summon them together
And ask them to watch over you
To each burn a candle for you
To make bright and clear your path
And to walk, like Christ, in grace and love
And guide you into my arms

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms

But I believe in Love
And I know that you do too
And I believe in some kind of path
That we can walk down, me and you
So keep your candles burning
And make her journey bright and pure
That she will keep returning
Always and evermore

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms
They told me that you were really bad news.
They said you were no good for me.
They told me you were a bad bad person.
But you seem alright to me.

I love you

They told me you hung around with all the wrong people.
They said you were no good for me.
They said I should not even talk to you.
Oh now you seem alright to me.

I love you

They told that you lied.
They said you'd do something bad to me.
But I can't seem to see that side.
When, when you're holding on to me.

I love you,
and that ain't bad
Went out to the west coast
To make a better life
It turned into a bad joke
I was barely making five

Every night in a flower palace room
I'd lie awake staring into the gloom
Thinking it would be so good

To be back in your arms tonight
Well you know it's gonna be alright
To be back in your arms tonight

I remember some days
Lying tangled in your bed
Your hair just like a halo
I watched you as you slept

So come on train carry me home
Don't give up the ghost
For so long i've been lost

I'll be back in your arms tonight
Oh you know it's gonna be alright
To be back in your arms tonight

Please be there
Last night when i called
You said i'm a wanderer
Don't be scared
I'm coming home to stay this time yea yeah
Home to stay

So come on train carry me home

And don't give up the ghost
For so long i've been lost

But i'll be back in your arms tonight
And you know it's gonna be alright
To be back in your arms tonight
Well you know it's gonna be alright

I'll be back in your arms tonight
Well you know it's gonna be alright
Back in your arms tonight
Well you know it's gonna be alright

I'm gonna be back in your arms
Back in your arms tonight baby

So come on train
You gotta carry me home now
So come on train
I gotta get back home to my baby

Train
(i know she's waiting)
Carry me home
(yeah she's waiting for me)

Train
(train train train)
Carry me home
(carry me home)
Train carry me home
Train

Stonemasons
Are becoming things of the past
And the modern age
Is finally taking us over at last
Don't you wonder why?
They're tearing all the the old houses down
Can't they see?
That they're the best places around

Don't tear it down
There's life in it yet
Don't tear it down

Don't you know that
History
Is written there deep in the walls
But the march of progress
Just wants to pour concrete over us all
Craftsmanship
The stone was cut by hand
Bulldozers
Are taking over the land

Don't tear it down, there's life in it yet
Don't tear it down, there's time for us yet
Don't tear it down

An expressway
Is planning to come thru our lounge
Eviction notes, in business coats
Never renovate, they just tear it down
A nation's heritage
They want to bring down without a sound
Another new town
On top of the real town

Don't tear it down, there's life in it yet
Don't tear it down, there's time for us yet
Don't tear it down, there's life in it yet
Don't tear it down

I'm on parade, you don't say: why can't you see that
Keeping my feelings at bay: why can't you see that when
When you're around, you just get me down, I'm better off without you
I'm just better off...
All of the years add up to: why can't you see that
Something has happened to you: why can't you see that when
When you're around, you just get me down, I'm better off without you
You just get me down
It's not me, it can't be
I'd rather leave
It's getting hard, to be a part
Of what is around
Is this the situation of the time
If so you can have yours, I want mine
I know there's something better you could be
Now I am past caring, completely
When you're around, you just get me down, I'm better off without you
Seagulls fly an opal sky
Likewise, fish are swimming in the ocean
Sunlight streaming thru the clouds
Not a care in this world, not a notion
I don't know if I should laugh or cry
You make me feel like I will never die
You can open my eyes with your sweet loving
Flowers! gently open wide
Swallow me up whole inside a daydream
Everything is nothing here
And nothing really ever is as it seems
I appreciate the majesty
Colliding in this lovely catastrophe
You can open my eyes with your sweet loning
...And it's a long, long way
It's a sunshine day
It's a long, long way from where I began...
The moon, he's smiling down on us
Stars, they dance across the heavens above
I feel like a child again
My arms wrapped around the girl that I love
Ooh, angel, you blow my soul
All the wonders of this world now unfold...
You can open my eyes with your sweet loving
When I was in grade six
I used to hold open the door for a girl
And she called me a wimp
She said there just isn't need to be so fucking polite
I politely agreed with her I think she was right

It just never entered my mind
That at 12 it all came down to chosing sides

You said that I'd die if I had nothing to do
Put a drink in my hand and I'll talk to anything that moves
I just refuse to give you what you think will make things right
Justifying hate when you've lost the will to fight

Would it be really in touch with the times
To put somebody down for choosing sides

And she said, show us them teeth
Give us them braces
Show us that dental work
That puts fear in 12 year old faces
I could make you feel
Even half worthwhile
Just please don't ask me to smile

And at times when it still feels right
I still hold open the door for a girl and I'll back down from a fight
And if there just isn't need to be so polite
At least it helps me sleep easier at night
It just never entered my mind
That it ever should come down to choosing sides

And she said, show us them teeth
Give us them braces
Show us that dental work
That puts fear in 12 year old faces
I could prove to you
That I do or don't get high
Just please don't ask me to smile

Poor Ned, you're better off dead
At least you'll get some peace of mind
You're out on the track
They're right on your back
Boy they're 'gonna hang you high

Eighteen hundred and seventy eight
Was the year I remember so well
They put my father in an early grave
Slung my mother in gaol
Now I don't know what's right or wrong
But they hung Christ on nails
Six kids at home and two still on the breast
They wouldn't even give her bail

You know I wrote a letter
'Bout Stringy-Bark Creek
So they would understand
That I might be a bushranger
But I'm not a murdering man
I didn't want to shoot Kennedy
Or that copper Lonnigan
He alone could have saved his life
By throwing down his gun

You know they took Ned Kelly
And they hung him in the Melbourne gaol
He fought so very bravely
Dressed in iron mail
And no man single-handed
Can hope to break the bars
It's a thousand like Ned Kelly
Who'll hoist the flag of stars

You get the world for your birthday baby
Open your eyes and say yes, no, maybe
The box ticks on the core is a bomb
the world is silent you listen like a lover to it

Sometimes a mirror's a miracle
Sometimes it's nothing at all
In this reflection even angels fall
You could fly anytime
Even though you own your own comet

Ordinary people it's OK
You don't have to wear those wings
They're stupid things

I know some dizzy easy heights
Don't stop your life at the lights
Don't be smart be a beginner
Don't be wrong even when it's right

Ordinary people it's okay
we're not watching anyway
It's okay

Riding on a lucky wheel of seventeen
I think I'm gonna live to be a hundred and three
Feel like wild card, what you say
A slice of the night gonna come my way
Walking through the city
I'm a king of surprise
My midnight champagne's ready on ice
It's Saturday night, I got nerves of steel
I can roll all night on a roulette wheel

Let the night roll on
I'm looking for hell
Let the night roll on
I'm making a kill

It's Saturday night
I've waited so long
Let the night roll on

Playing along with the rest of the world
Saxophone women, satisfied girls
I'm a wound-up string on a violin
The future's gonna take me where I've never been
I could be naked Sunday with nothing to wear
I wouldn't know it, I wouldn't care
It's Saturday night, I got nerves of steel
I can roll all night on a roulette wheel

Let the night roll on
I'm looking for hell
Let the night roll on
I'm making a kill

It's Saturday night
I've waited so long
Let the night roll on

(Solo)

(Let the night roll on)
I'm looking for hell
(Let the night roll on)
I'm making a kill

It's Saturday night
I've waited so long

(Let the night roll on)
(Let the night roll on)
(Let the night roll on)...looking for hell
(Let the night roll on)...making a kill
You can't take me anywhere
I'll strip down to my underwear
If you give me half a chance

Hippy-freelove
Outta sight!
I'm gonna turn off every light
And hold a private dance

It started out one afternoon
Hot sake in my living room
Among some special friends

Soon some others dropped around
And we all started gaffing down
And you know how these things end!

Miss Freelove
Come back sometime
Miss Freelove of '69

Torches flashing
Sweaty passion
Each made love in their own fashion
We had quite a ball!

Do the monkey
Feeling funky
I'm just like any disco junkie
And I don't care at all

Maybe I'm not thinking straight
I only know that it feels great
And I'm glad you do too

It could be just a passing fad
But think about the fun we had
The last time you decided to pass through

Miss Freelove
Come back sometime
Miss Freelove of '69

And everything is gone and far away
And everything is gone and that's o.k
And everything is groovy, would you say?
Would you say?

Someone called the cops on us
They didn't have the heart to bust
The kinky scene they found

They checked their badges at the door
And joined the action on the floor
And laid their nightsticks down

Miss Freelove
La-la-la-la love
La-la-la-la love
Freelove!

I don't know what you want from me
Or what you think a love ought to be
I want something that's open and strong
As the country this road's moving on

From the mountain to the valley
From the ocean to the alley
From the highway to the river
One emotion to deliver
One heart, one way, one love
To share but not to chain
That's freedom

It's a song of the heart
A race in the wind
A light in the dark
That's freedom
It's a reason to live
And after the rain
Rekindle the spark
Let freedom ring

I don't know why it takes so long
To remember
What the world's doin' wrong
Never wanted to shove my plan or another
Who can't understand

All I want is a fast lane
To where the road across this plain
Won't take you
I want something you understand
To make us stand proud
As nothing else can
That's freedom

It's a song of the heart
A race in the wind
A light in the dark
That's freedom
It's a reason to live
And after the rain
Rekindle the spark
Let freedom ring
It's a measure of trust
When love is alive
It's tender and tough
That's freedom
It's all love is about
This opening up and letting out
Let freedom ring

From the mountain to the valley
From the ocean to the alley
From the highway to the river
One emotion to deliver
One heart, one way, one love
To share but not to chain
That's freedom

It's a song of the heart
A race in the wind
A light in the dark
That's freedom
It's a reason to live
And after the rain
Rekindle the spark
Let freedom ring
It's a measure of trust
When love is alive
It's tender and tough
That's freedom
It's all love is about
This opening up and letting out
Let freedom ring
There came a man on a stolen horse
And he rode right onto the page
Burning bright but not for long
Lit up with a holy rage
No turning back for the child of grace
With the blood red on his hand
Never known to hurt a woman
He never robbed an honest man
His mother held in jail, his daddy dead
And daily rising the price upon his head
Our sunshine, our sunshine
Through fire and flood, through tears and blood
Through dust and mud still riding on
Forever trapped in a suit of steel
With the hotel burning behind
Betrayed by his companions
And the train waiting down the line
Forever tall on a bareback horse
Getting through by the skin of his teeth
It's one more for the ladies
Now one more for the police
Riding all night hungry, tired and cold
Into the misty morning
He'll never grow old
Our sunshine, our sunshine
Through fire and flood, through tears and blood
Through dust and mud still riding on
As he stood before the judge’s chair
He said ‘I’m free and easy-I’ll see you there!’
Our sunshine, our sunshine
Through fire and flood, through tears and blood
Through dust and mud still riding on
This girl didn't know what happened
When she knocked upon my door
The things you had, the life you lived
All the dreams you had before
Your eyes were facin' your heart and soul
You know they said it all
What happened on that day back then
The moment hurt us all

Now you can see the reason why not everyone's the same
And you don't have to please them, or try hard to save your name

They said you'd never get anywhere
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, and I know better
They said you'd never get anywhere
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, that I know better
(Yes I do)

Well the days go by and you wonder why, "is this really true?"
Your heart says "No" but your feelings show the poor baby never knew
But you and I, we knew deep down, that ain't really you
We always knew that it'd work out right and we could start anew

Now you can see the reason why not everyone's the same
And you don't have to please them, or try hard to save your name

They said you'd never get anywhere
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, and I know better
They said you'd never get anywhere
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, that I know better

Well things ain't always what they seem
So wake up and get outta your dreams
Things ain't always what they seem so wake up!
Well things ain't always what they seem
Wake up man, you're in my dreams!
Things ain't always...

Oh now you can see the reason why not everyone's the same
And you don't have to please them, or try hard

They said you'd never get anywhere
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, that I know better
They said you'd never get anywhere
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, that I know better
They said you'd never get anywhere
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, that I know better

A one, two, three, four, they said you'd never get anywhere
Well they don't care and it's just not fair

You're never gonna get anywhere
That's what they tell me

Never, never, never, never, never, never
Never gonna get anywhere
They don't care, and that's not fair!

They said you'd never get anywhere
They don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, and I know
(better)
Got your pictures
Constantly reminding me
I won't be sleeping tonight
And this empty feeling I have inside
Lets me know that I was just a waste of time
When you find yourself alone
And theres no place left to go

Come back home
Please come back to me
With open arms
I will receive you

Come back home
Please come back to me
It's been so long
I'm dying to see you

You've taken everything
You've lost yourself
You've never been here before
Your fading faster under sunset skies
Always searching for more
So when you find yourself alone
And there's no place left to go

Come back home
Please come back to me
With open arms
I will receive you

Come back home
Please come back to me
It's been so long
I'm dying to see you

It's getting hard to see you like this
How do I save a love that's fading faster
Head first and heading for disaster

It's getting hard to see you like this
How do I save a love that's fading faster
Head first and heading for disaster

Come back home
Please come back to me
With open arms
I will receive you

Come back home
Please come back to me
It's been so long
I'm dying to see you

Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
I'm dying to see you
This song speaks of an aboriginal man getting castrated

Its always hard when the journey begins
Hard to find your way
Hard to make new friends
But there's nothing you can't do
You've got the power inside of you
Its not always black and white
But your heart always knows whats right
Its not about winin or loose
Its about the path you choose
Let the journey begin
POKEMON

Whether I'm right or wrong, there's no phrase that hits
Like an ocean needs the sand or a dirty old shoe that fits
And if all the world was perfect, I would only ever want to see your scars
You know they can have their universe, but we'll be in the dirt designing stars

And darling, you know...
You make me feel so beautiful
Nowhere else in the world I want to be
You make me feel so beautiful

Whether I'm up or down, there's no crowd to please
I'm like a faith without a clause to believe in it
And if all the world was smiling, I would only ever want to see your frown
You know they can sail away in sunsets, we'll be right here stranded on the ground

Just happy to be found...
You make me feel so beautiful
Nowhere else in the world I want to be
You make me feel so beautiful

I have lost my illusions, I have drowned in your words
I have left my confusion to a cynical world
I am throwing myself at things I don't understand
Discover enlightenment holding your hand

You are so beautiful...
Yeah, darling, you know!
That you make me feel so beautiful
Nowhere else in the world I want to be
Yeah, you make me feel so beautiful...

Darling, you know...
You make me feel so beautiful
Yeah, darling, you know!
That you make me feel so beautiful
(You are beautiful, you are beautiful...)
(You are, you are, you are, you are so beautiful...)
Yeah, darling, you know!
(You are beautiful, oh you are, you are so beautiful...)
Once I built a castle in the air
A home for you and I-
In a blue, blue sky
We'd leave behind the weight of worldly care
I thought we could fly
We only had to try

Ah, I had to learn fast, (For your own good)
I had to learn fast
And when I knew at last (You understood)
I knew at last

Hell and heaven can be one and the same
If you don't know how
You should know by now
Every pleasure always holds an equal amount of pain
But it all works out
I have no doubt

Ah, we had to learn fast, (For our own good)
We had to barn fast
And when we knew at last (When we understood)
We knew at last

Every kite has got to have a string for it to fly
Up to who knows where ?
Castles in the air
So there are strings attached to you and I
Though they hold us tight
We can take flight
Cross-legged on the front lawn she's had a bad pill
The lights of the city they can all go to hell
It'll all come good if she can put in the hours
She wants to get into film but it's gonna take years
She wishes she wrote songs like the ones that you hear
The boys are all 20 and they leave her on the edge

And she's telling herself "They'll see
They'll see the beauty in me
They'll see the beauty it's in my soul"

Her lift is waiting she'll be there soon
Rocking forwards and backwards eyeballing the moon
Unwired like a child of the rich
She's pretty and long and part of the scene
Playing with her phone like it's a rosary
Should get up and take them all on now

First she can tell them why she's so sad
Why this girl is crying
Of all the excuses that she's ever had
Well she's nearly 20 and so very old
There'll be food on the table tonight
There'll be pay in your pocket tonight

My gut is wrenched out it is crunched up and broken
My life that is lived is no more than a token
Who'll strike the flint upon the stone and tell me why?

If I yell out at night there's a reply of blue silence
The screen is no comfort I can't speak my sentence
They blew the lights at heaven's gate and I don't know why

But if I work all day on the blue sky mine
(There'll be food on the table tonight)
Still I walk up and down on the blue sky mine
(There'll be pay in your pocket tonight)

The candy store paupers lie to the shareholders
They're crossing their fingers they pay the truth makers
The balance sheet is breaking up the sky

So I'm caught at the junction still waiting for medicine
The sweat of my brow keeps on feeding the engine
Hope the crumbs in my pocket can keep me for another night

And if the blue sky mining company won't come to my rescue
If the sugar refining company won't save me

Who's gonna save me?

And some have sailed from a distant shore
And the company takes what the company wants
And nothing's as precious
As a hole in the ground

Who's gonna save me?
I pray that sense and reason brings us in
Who's gonna save me?
We've got nothing to fear

In the end the rain comes down
Washes clean the streets of a blue sky town

Walking through the high dry grass
Pushing my way through slow
Yellow belly black snake
Sleeping on a red rock
Waiting for the stranger to go

Sugar train stops at the crossing
Cane cockies cursing below
Bad storm coming
Better run to the top of the mountain

Mountain in the shadow of light
Rain in the valley below
Mountain in the shadow of light
Rain in the valley
Well you can say you're Peter, say you're Paul
Don't put me up on your bedroom wall
Call me king of the mountain

Blacksmith fires up the bellows
Cane cutters burning the load
Workers of the world
Run to the top of the mountain

Mountain in the shadow of light...

I can't take the hands from my face
There are some things we can't replace

Mountain...

Over liquid tarmac wastelands of cactus and heat
Down cobblestone alleyways of washing day sheets
Up ghost prairie mountains of sunset and space
Down the road a familiar face
Across the wilderness
Out further than the bush
I will follow you
Hey everybody - can't you hear me call?
I'm standing in a the street inside a fireball
Tomorrow's in the future - death is in the cradle
We're all day dreaming at the breakfast table

Down Main Street with the dust in my lungs
The blisters on my shoulder - the end has just begun
I'm swimming in the heat when the rads his my tongue
The remnants of my children are having too much fun

Inside a fireball
Inside a fireball

There's a big copper digger in the middle of town
The birds are on his head - the rags are hanging down
The grip on the grenade in his broken hand
As loose as the union's on the hot red sand

Inside a fireball
Inside a fireball

"We will not die and it is no crime
Ya take the whole world upon ya shoulder
For the very last time"

Well I blasted my way through the barrier range
I ripped up the ground but nothing has changed
Bromide, sulphide, oxide, slag
We're cleaning out the can with an oily rag

I'll live on the dole or I'll die in the dust
If they turn up the shift then strike we must
The company's here but the money's all gone
But I'm still digging, I'm still strong!

Inside a fireball
Inside a fireball

Hey everybody, can't ya hear me call?
I'm standing in the street inside a fireball
Tomorrow's in the future - death is in the cradle
You're all chin waggin' around the conference table

Inside a fireball
Inside a fireball

We, we will not die
And it is, it is no crime
You take the whole world upon your shoulders
For the very last, for the very last time
Ooh

Who can it be knocking at my door?
Go 'way, don't come 'round here no more.
Can't you see that it's late at night?
I'm very tired, and I'm not feeling right.
All I wish is to be alone;
Stay away, don't you invade my home.
Best off if you hang outside,
Don't come in - I'll only run and hide.

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

Who can it be knocking at my door?
Make no sound, tip-toe across the floor.
If he hears, he'll knock all day,
I'll be trapped, and here I'll have to stay.
I've done no harm, I keep to myself;
There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health.
I like it here with my childhood friend;
Here they come, those feelings again!

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

Is it the man come to take me away?
Why do they follow me?
It's not the future that I can see,
It's just my fantasy

Oh...Who can it be now?
Oh...Who can it...Who can it...
Yeah yeah yeah

Hey where did we go
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughing and a running hey, hey
Skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a thumpin' and you
My brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the water fall, with you
My brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Started out, just drinkin' beer
I didn't know how or why
Or what I was doin' there
Just a couple more
Made me feel a little better
Believe me when I tell you
It was nothin' to do with the letter

I ran right out of beer
I took a look into the larder
No bones, nothin'
I'd better go and get somethin' harder
Back in a flash
I started on a dash of Jamaica rum
Me and Pat Malone
Drinking on our ow-ow-ow-own

Woh-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger
Woh-yeah, the nips are gettin' bigger
Wo-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger
Yeah-eah-eah, mmm they're gettin' bigger

Sometimes I wonder
What all these chemicals
Are doin' to my brain
Doesn't worry me enough
To stop me from doin' it agai-ai-ain
Wipin' out brain cells
By the millions but I don't care
It doesn't worry me
Even though
I ain't got a lot to spare-are-are

Woh-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger
Woh-yeah-eah, the nips are gettin' bigger
Wo-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger
Yeah-eah-eah, they're gettin' bigger
Well I've walked a mile or two-oo in my lifetime
And I've travelled down some muddy tracks and dry
'Cause if I wanted to get where I was go-oin'
I knew I'd just have to walk that country mile

Now a country mile would be the longest distance
A man could ever travel when he's down
And you curse the never ending road before you
When you think you'll never make it into town

But you meet a friend or two along the highway
And you'll learn a lot you never knew before
And if the journey takes a lifetime
When you thought a year or two
Well you just don't give up easy anymore

And I've walked a mile or two-oo in my lifetime
And I've travelled down some muddy tracks and dry
'Cause if I wanted to get where I was go-oin'
I knew I'd just have to walk that country mile

Walkin' that long mile has shown me changes
Changes in the people and the land
But I'll bet the road to Marble Bar's no better
Than when I drove with trucks and caravans

And a country bloke is still the same old battler
No matter what the place he's workin' in
And although I've covered many miles
I still can't wait to see
What the next long country mile will bring

Well I've walked a mile or two-oo in my lifetime
And I've travelled down some muddy tracks and dry
'Cause if I wanted to get where I was go-oin'
I knew I'd just have to walk that country mile
Yes I knew I'd have to walk that country mile
I came from the dreamtime
From the dusty red soil plains
I am the ancient heart
The keeper of the flames
I Stood upon the rocky shore
I watched the tall ships come
For forty thousand years I've been the first Australian

I came upon the prison ships
Bound down by iron chains
I cured the land
Endured the lash
And waited for the rains
I'm a settler
I'm a farmers wife
On a dry and barren run
A convict and a free man
I became Australian

I'm a daughter of a digger
Who sought the mother load
The girl became a women
On the long and dusty road
I'm a child of the depression
I saw the good time come
I'm a bushy I'm a battler
I am Australian

We are one
But we are many
And from all the lands on earth we come
We'll share a dream
And sing with one voice
I am, you are, we are Australian

I'm a teller of stories
I'm a singer of songs
I am Albert Namatjira
And I paint the ghostly gums
I'm Clancy on his horse
I'm Ned Kelly on the run
I'm the one who waltzed matilda
I am Australian

I'm the hot wind from the desert
I'm the black soil of the plain
I'm the mountains and the valleys
I'm the drowned and flooding rains
I am the rock
I am the sky
The rivers when they run
The spirit of this great land
I am Australian

We are one
But we are many
And from all the lands on earth we come
We'll share a dream
And sing with one voice
I am, you are, we are Australian

We are one
But we are many
And from all the lands on earth we come
We'll share a dream
And sing with one voice
I am, you are, we are Australian
Hey, here is the story
Forget about the trouble in life
Don't you know, it's not easy
When you gotta walk upon that line

That's why
You need
Oooh that's why
This is what you need
I'll give you what you need

Don't you get sad and lonely
You need a change from
What you do all day
Ain't no sense in all your crying
Pick it up and throw it into shape

That's why
You need
Oooh that's why
This is what you need
I'll give you what you need

Hey you, won't you listen
This is not the end of it all
Don't you see there is a rhythm
I'll take you where you
Really need to be
Why are you in so much hurry
Is it really worth the worry
Look around
Then slow down

What's it like inside the bubble
Does your head ever give you trouble
It's no sin
Trade it in

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man

Are you always in confusion
Surrounded by illusion
Sort it out
You'll make out

Seem to make a good beginning
Someone else ends up winning
Don't seem fair
Don't you care

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man

Don't you forget who'll take care of you
It don't matter what you do
Form a duet, let him sing melody
You'll provide the harmony

Why are you in so much hurry
Is it really worth the worry
Look around
Then slow down

What's it like inside the bubble
Does your head ever give you trouble
It's no sin
Trade it in

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man
If everybody in Australia
From Perth to Byron Bay
Got on a jumbo
To California
Wearing New York T-shirts
And living in LA
Tell Malcolm we're servin'
Servin' USA

We think Jimmy Carter
Is a real good bloke
We'll sell him our country
For a Ford and a Coke
He wants our uranium
We'll give it away
Tell Malcolm we're servin'
Servin' USA

We all sing like Americans
Playing rock and roll
Have a beer at Blinman
Before it gets sold
Eat out at the Colonel's
And on election day
Tell Malcolm we're servin'
Servin' USA

We'll be servin' in Queensland
Hobart, Melbourne and Russell Hill
Sydney, Pine Gap
Brisbane and Bougainville
Tonsley Park, Rum Jungle
Woodville, Adelaide
Tell Malcolm we're servin'
Servin' USA

And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah let's be clear I'll trust no one

You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubberband until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast

But you won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubberband until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast

But you won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubberband until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast

But you won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubberband until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast

But you won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart

Ooooh
I'm so spaced out today
Ooooh
I could have slept for days
It's like a radar
And it comes
To you

From the sea
From the sea
From the sea

Ooooh
She's just so under pain
Ooooh
I'm so spaced out today
My head's a light weight
And it comes
To you
From the sea
From the sea
From the sea

Hello hello oh hello
(the world repeats itself some how)
She knows she knows oh she knows
(The world repeats itself some how)
Only just beginning to know
She's only just beginning to know

Ooooh
There's just no oxygen
Ooooh
Why can't we just fall in
In the sea

Hello hello oh hello
(the world repeats itself some how)
She knows she knows oh she knows
(The world repeats itself some how)

Oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh
oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh
oh-oh oh-oh-oh

Hello hello oh hello
(the world repeats itself some how)
She knows she knows oh she knows
(The world repeats itself some how)
Only just beginning to know
She's only just beginning to know
She's only just beginning to know now
Shake some action, psychotic reaction
No satisfaction, sky pilot, sky Saxon
That’s what I like
That’s what I like
Blitzkrieg bop to the jailhouse rock
Stop, stop at the hop, do the bluejean bop
That’s what I like
That’s what I like

Better get off my cloud 'cause two's a crowd
Better get off the phone, there's nobody at home
I’m gonna work it on out, I’m gonna twist and shout
I'm gonna ride a white swan and get it on
Let's all turn on

Born to lose those summertime blues
In blue suede shoes, le Hoodoo Gurus
That’s what I like
That’s what I like
Waiting for my man, baby, can the can
I wanna hold your hand, remember Sam the sham?
That’s what I like
That’s what I like

Better get off my cloud 'cause two's a crowd
Better get off the phone, there's nobody at home
I'm gonna work it on out, I'm gonna twist and shout
I'm gonna ride a white swan and get it on
Let's all turn on

When you walk in the room, sunny afternoon
A-wop-bop a-loo-bop, a-lop-bam-boom
That’s what I like
That’s what I like
Sugar, sugar, talk, talk, money, honey, boardwalk
Who wears short shorts? (we wear short shorts)
That's what I like
That's what I like
That's what I like

Turn on
Turn on
Turn on
Turn on
She was a fast machine
She kept the motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen

She had sightless eyes
Telling me no lies
Knockin' me out with those American thighs

Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there

Cause the walls started shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were makin' it
and you...

Shook me all night long
Yeah you, shook me all night long

Walking double time on the seduction line
She was one of a kind
She's just mine all mine

Wanted no applause
It's just another cause
Made a meal out of me, and come back for more

Had to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing

But the walls was shaking
Earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it
and you...

Shook me all night long
Yeah you, shook me all night long
Knockin' me out, yeah you
Shook me all night long
You really shook me, yeah you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well you shook me...

You, shook me all night long
Yeah you,Shook me all night long
You really got me, and you
Shook me all night long
You really got me, and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah you shook me
Yeah you shook me
All night long...
Where is Mona?
She's long gone
Where is Mary?
She's taken her along
But they haven't put their mittens on
And there's fifteen feet of pure white snow?

Where is Michael?
Where is Mark?
Where is Mathew
Now it's getting dark?
Where is John? They are all out back
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Would you please put down that telephone
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow

I waved to my neighbour
My neighbour waved to me
But my neighbour
Is my enemy
I kept waving my arms
Till I could not see
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow

Is anybody
Out there please?
It's too quiet in here
And I'm beginning to freeze
I've got icicles hanging
From my knees
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow

Is there anybody here who feels this low?
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow

Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Is it any wonder?
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord

Doctor, Doctor
I'm going mad
This is the worst day
I've ever had
I can't remember
Ever feeling this bad
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Where's my nurse
I need some healing
I've been paralysed
By a lack of feeling
I can't even find
Anything worth stealing
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow

Is there anyone else here who doesn't know?
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow

Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Is it any wonder?
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord
Save Yourself! Help Yourself!
Save Yourself! Help Yourself!
Save Yourself! Help Yourself!
Save Yourself! Help Yourself!
White domes on sacred land, B52’s in Arnhem Land
Cold wars buccaneers, lasers in the stratosphere
There’s a shadow across the sun, alarms of struggle and flight
There’s poised seeds in the perfumed garden
And the spectre of an endless night

Thunder in the distance, running with the hurricane
Feel the cold winds turning, keep the faith burning
Fire in the Ukraine, dust on the high plains
Thunder in the distance, running with the hurricane

Vogue fashions, empty passions, world banks, corporation think-tanks
Feeding us our new-made view, with out Weeties and our spectic news
Geriatric B-grade actor, power in his paternal smile
His inane quotes are last years jokes
Now we judge all his lies on style

Melt-down, southbound, the winds are blowing gale force
Gather up the children, batten down the doors
Hope’s like a beacon in the howling night
Mururoa, Pine Gap, Greenham Common
Together it’s going to be a long, hard fight

Rambo, cult machismo, Armageddon, the clouds keep spreading
Warriors rule by fear, fission for the profiteers
Mass march, rally in the twilight, heart and soul, a call for peace
If power is blocked through the ballot box
Then we’ll vote it in the open streets
If you're havin' trouble with the high school head
He's givin' you the blues
You wanna graduate but not in his bed
Here's what you gotta do
Pick up the phone, I'm always home
Call me any time
Just ring 36 24 36 hey
I lead a life of crime

Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
(Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap)
(Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap)

You got problems in your life of love
You got a broken heart
He's double dealin' with your best friend
That's when the teardrops star fella
Pick up the phone, I'm here alone
Or make a social call
Come right in, forget 'bout him
We'll have ourselves a ball hey

Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
(Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap)
(Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap)
Yeahhh

If you got a lady and you want her gone
But you ain't got the guts
She keeps naggin' at you night and day
Enough to drive you nuts
Pick up the phone, leave her alone
It's time you made a stand
For a fee, I'm happy to be
Your back door man hey

Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
(Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap) yeah
(Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap)
(Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap)
(Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap)

Concrete shoes, cyanide, TNT
(Done dirt cheap)
Neck ties, contracts, high voltage
(Done dirt cheap)

Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds,

Done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, dirty deeds, dirty deeds,
Done dirt cheap, ahhhhh

Before too long
The one that you're loving
Will wish that he'd never met you
Before too long
He who is nothing
Will suddenly come into view

So let the time keep rolling on
It's on my side
Lonely nights will soon be gone
High is the tide

Before too long
We'll be together
And no-one will tear us apart
Before too long
The words will be spoken
I know all the action by heart

As the night time follows day
I'm closing in
Every dog will have his day
Any dog can win
Shut the shade do no fear anymore
Here I come creeping round your back door

Before too long
I'll be repeating
What's happened before in my mind
Before too long
Over and over
Just like a hammer inside

As the nighttime follows day
I'm closing in
Every dog will have his day
Any dog can win
Before too long
Before too long
It must be all of three years now since Billy hit the track
And Jenny with a broken heart has been to hell and back
They say she'll never love again, t'was just a one night stand
For she's still holds a candle for that no good truckin' man
Now Jenny runs a diner where she's workin' until late
To catch a glimpse of Billy when he's hauling interstate
But every trucks a Kenworth when she's lookin' for a Mack
And deep down in her heart she knows that Billy won't be back
Hey!
Instrumental
He's out there somewhere in the night the flashes comes again
She sees him on a mountain road in driving wind and rain
With vision poor and glaring lights and blinded weary eyes
Ah she prays to God, "Don't let it be the way that Billy dies."
Instrumental
She watches all the trucks roll in, there’s Jim from Gundagai
She watches out for Billy's truck in traffic passin' by
And with the roster for the day the staff are briefed before
"Watch out for that big ol' Mack with pinstripes on the door."
She drives out on the slower lane on the highway out of town
And every truck she sees his face, her world is upside down
She parks beside the vacant block, they lived there in a van
And remembers how she loved and lost that no good trucking man
Hey!
Instrumental
It must be all of three years now since Billy hit the track
And Jenny with a broken heart has been to hell and back
They say she'll never love again, t'was just a one night stand
For she's still holds a candle for that no good truckin' man
Hey
Yes she's still holds a candle for that no good truckin' man
There was the stage, two red lights and a dodgy P.A
You trod the planks way back then
And it's strange that you're here again, here again

And I wish I, wish I knew the right words
To make you feel better, walk out of this place
Defeat them in your secret battle
Show them you can be your own man again

Don't, don't explain
Lots of little victories take on the pain
It takes so long to earn
You can double up or you can burn, you can burn

And I wish I, wish I knew the right words
To make you feel better, walk out of this place
Defeat them in your secret battle
Show them you can be your own man again

And I wish I, wish I knew the right words
To blow up the pokies and drag them away
Cause they're taking the food off your table
So they can say that the trains run on time

Flashing lights, it's a real show
And your wife? I wouldn't go home
The little bundles need care
And you can't be a father there, father there

And I wish I, wish I knew the right words
To make you feel better, walk out of this place
Defeat them in your secret battle
Show them you can be your own man again
Show them you can be your own man again

And I wish I, wish I knew the right words
To blow up the pokies and drag them away
Cause they're taking the food off your table
So they can say that the trains run on time
Another man there was made the trains run on time
(Tellin' everybody what you're doing to me
Tellin' everybody what you're doin')
Ain't no doubt about it
Girl you drive me wild
Seems you're wasting over
My punishment befits your crime
I can't stop thinkin' about it
The thing you've done to me

Tellin' everybody
You're the reason why I had a good time
(Tellin' everybody what you're doing to me
Tellin' everybody what you're doin')
Age defies your body
Looks defy my mind
Girl you take me higher
Lady you're perfect defined
So don't stop thinkin' about it
Ain't too much stuff for me
I'll keep workin' it harder
I'll keep it up won't bother me
I've never been an angel
But you can show me how
I wanna be your baby
Na-na-na-na-na-na-now
So I'm tellin' everybody
Tellin' everybody what we did last night

Would it stain
If the lights fell down on your name
And each face began to look all the same
How much is enough?
Did you ever want to just lose touch with everybody you know?
In the morning
When you've wiped his taste away
The last of the red and all the records you played
How much is enough?
Did you ever want to just lose touch with everybody who heard?

Did you ever want to join a collective
Throw a party just to make sure you missed it?
Did you ever want to be a collective?

Would you sell out
To the dealer with the lowest cost
And burn every proscenium floor
How much is enough?
Did you ever want to get in touch with somebody you hurt?

Offered up some kind of collective
So you can never ever be left selected
Did you ever want to be a collective?

If the lights, they fell
Do you think you could tell
just how much?

Come take my hand
You should know me
I've always been in your mind
You know that I'll be kind
I'll be guiding you

Building your dream
Has to start now
There's no other road to take
You won't make a mistake
I'll be guiding you

You have to believe we are magic
Nothin' can stand in our way
You have to believe we are magic
Don't let your aim ever stray
And if all your hopes survive
Your destiny will arrive
I'll bring all your dreams alive
For you

From where I stand
You are home free
The planets align so rare
There's promise in the air
And I'm guiding you

Through every turn I'll be near you
I'll come anytime you call
I'll catch you when you fall
I'll be guiding you

You have to believe we are magic
Nothin' can stand in our way
You have to believe we are magic
Don't let your aim ever stray
And if all your hopes survive
Your destiny will arrive
I'll bring all your dreams alive
For you
Well the drums rolled off in my forehead
and the guns went off in my chest
Remember carrying the baby for you
Crying in the wilderness

I lost track of my friends, I lost my kin
I cut them off as limbs
I drove out over the flatlands

hunting down you and him
The sky was big and empty
My chest filled to explode
I yelled my insides out at the sun
At the wide open road

it's a wide open road, it's a wide open road
How do you think it feels
sleeping by yourself?
when the one you love, the one you love
is with someone else
Then it's a wide open road

It's a wide open road
And now you can go any place
that you ever wanted to go
I wake up in the morning
thinking I'm still by your side

I reach out just to touch you
then I realise
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road

You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed (X 4)

You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed
Yeah that's what your girlfriend said
You just like me 'cos I give you some head
You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed

Well I'll meet you in the pub at two minutes to ten
You're all ready to go
Six bottles of beer and a sneer on your face
I'd run but I'm much too slow

You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed (X 4)

At half past one I'm flat on the floor
Caught like a rat in a trap
Fifteen times a week and you still want more
God you talk such crap

You just like 'cos I'm good in bed (X 4)

You imagine yourself as Mick Jagger's girlfriend
He wouldn't even spit in your eye
I bet you he don't get raped every weekend
I feel so weak I could die

You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed (X 4)

You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed
Yeah that's what your girlfriend said
You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed
You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed
I don't go to parties baby
'Cause people tend to freak me out
Watch their lips to work it out
I can hear the words but I still don't know what it's all about

You won't see me down the disco mama
Bright lights really hurt my eyes
I'd rather stay and dance with you
To the funky music playing on our stereo

Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me
Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me

I don't go to concerts baby
The music's always up too loud
Cigarettes and alcohol get up my ass
I always lose you in the crowd

You won't see me tribal raving baby
'Cause I won't ever look that good
I'd rather dance in ugly pants
In the comfort of a loungeroom in suburbia

Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me
Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me

That's right

Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me
Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me

That's right

Better than you and me
Better than you and me

Thank you Mr. DJ
Let me tell you about my mountain home
Where all the ladies names are Joan
Where husbands work back late at night
Hopes are up for trousers down
With hostess on a business flight
Taxi in a Mercedes drive
I hope that driver's coming out alive
The garden is a dorsetted
That lady - she's so corseted
She's got 15 ways to lead that boy astray
He thinks he's one and only
But that lovely she's so lonely
She pumps him full of breakfast and she sends him on his way
What a sing song dance
What a performance
What a cheap tent show
Oh no no no no no

Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up (x2)
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up

Silently she opens the drawer
Mother's little helper is coming out for more
Strategically positioned before the midday show
Her back is arched, those lips are parched
Repeated blow by blow
Later at the party all the MPs rave
About the hummers she's been giving
And the money that they save
To her it is skin lotion
For his promotion to
That flat in Surfer's Paradise with the ocean view
What a sing song dance
What a performance
What a cheap tent show
Oh no no no no no

If you've ever been lonely
Then you'll understand
Why I treasure every smile you show me
And every touch of your ha-and
I've been waiting a long time
For a girl like you
Oh and maybe this will be the right time
For all my dreams to come true-ue
I wanna make you my lady, make you my lady
Love is so hard to find girl
I wanna make you my lady, take you my lady
Then you'll be forever mine gir-irl
Do you think I'm pretendin'
Do you think I'd lie, baby
Oh it could be never endi-in'
If you'll give it a try-y
I wanna make you my lady, make you my lady
Love is so hard to find girl
I wanna make you my lady, take you my lady
Then you'll be forever mine gir-irl
Gonna fly-y over a rainbow
Gonna find a heaven on earth we can share
Paradise is not far away, so
Just show me you care
And I'll take you there-ere...
I wanna make you my lady, make you my lady
Love is so hard to find girl
I wanna make you my lady, take you my lady-y
I wanna make you my lady, make you my lady
Love is so hard to find gir-irl
I wanna make you my lady, take you my lady
Then you'll be forever mine gir-irl
I wanna make you my lady, make you my lady
Then you'll be forever mine gir-ir-ir-irl...

I'm tired of my life
I feel so in between
I'm sick of all my friends
Girls can be so mean

I feel like jumping out
Everything's my way
Starting over new
Cause I'm not even there

Sometimes
I wanna get away some place
But I don't wanna stay too long
Sometimes
I wanna brand new day
Try to fit in where I don't belong

Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
I wanna feel the rain in my hair
Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
Where should we go, I don't even care

Anywhere is good enough, 
Hook Me Up, Hook Me Up

I'd like the lights turned out
The sound of closing doors
I'm not like other girls
Who always feel so sure

With everything made up
Of what they're gonna be
Sometimes I'm just a girl
Who's not so tired of me

Sometimes
I wanna disappear some place
But I don't wanna stay to long
Sometimes
I'm feeling so alone
Tryna' fit in where I don't belong

Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
I wanna feel the rain in my hair
Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
Where should we go, I don't even care

Anywhere is good enough, 
Hook Me Up, Hook Me Up
Anywhere is good enough, 
Hook Me Up

I'm gonna crash and burn
I'm gonna find a way
There's nothing left to say

Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
I wanna feel the rain in my hair
Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
Where should we go, I don't even care

Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
I wanna feel the rain in my hair
Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
Where should we go, I don't even care

Anywhere is good enough, 
Hook Me Up, Hook Me Up,
Hook Me Up

Got a letter from Davie just the other day
Said livin in Queensland was not OK
Can't find the money just to pay the rent
'nd the food and the herb -
Well they're just heaven sent
He's been livin' on the Razor's edge
Tryin' to touch the sun
He won't fall for that same old trick again
Cathy's alright. She just gets lonely everyday
She's livin' with a dream-world of yesterday
And there she is but here she'll stay
"Well it just never works out," she said, "Anyway!"
She's been livin' on the Razor's edge
Tryin' to touch the sun
She won't fall for that same old trick again
Lulu's too tired of livin' down by Torquay
She's gettin' herself together - financially
Says "One of these days I'm just gonna lie in the sun"
But right now I'm wondering does that day ever come?
She's been livin' on the Razor's edge
Tryin' to touch the sun
She won't fall for that same old trick again
Got a letter from Davie just the other day
'nd the note just read, "Please come to Byron Bay"
Well the heart says 'Go' 'nd the head says 'Stay'
'nd the big wheels just keep turnin' everyday...
Don't go livin' on a Razor's edge
Or tryin' to touch the sun
'Cause you'll just fall for that same old trick again - (that's what they tell ya')
Well we're livin' on a Razor's edge
Tryin' to touch the sun
'nd we won't fall for that same old trick again
(Such a fine line...
...I was meanin' to write)

I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you're hurt too but 
what else can we do
Tormented and torn apart
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For the times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know
doesn't really know

I'm all out of love,
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love,
what am I without you
I can't be too late 
to say that I was so wrong

I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too
Does the feeling seem oh so right
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone...

I'm all out of love,
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love,
what am I without you
I can't be too late 
to say that I was so wrong

Oh, what are you thinking of?
What are you thinking of?
Oh, what are you thinking of?

I know I was so wrong

I'm all out of love,
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long

I know I was so wrong

I'm all out of love,
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love,
what am I without you
I can't be too late 
to say that I was so wrong

Say that you love me one more time

Remember the times when we were kids
Playing war games in your yard
Everybody had to be a hero
And get one in the heart
Night would fall and we'd call a truce
And all go home

Years went by we were average guys
Playing life by the rule of thumb
Till a man came on the tv
Talking 'bout war like he wanted one
He said "everybody put your backs to the wall
Till your numbers called"

You've gotta go and be a hero
I've got a new game for all you boys
Its war without a choice
Compulsory hero
Just try and make it home

Grandpa heard the call to all
For a war to end all wars
And your dad went off to do his bit
And he had to go one more
You've really got no say in it
You have to fight
And thats the law

You've gotta go and be a hero
They made a law you had to go fight
One more crazy war
Compulsory hero
Just try and make it home

So all that had to be heroes
Went off to do their chores
None of them really wouldn't of known
How far a bloody war goes
They're dying to make it home

Then i think back on all those times
Playing war games in your yard
Everybody had to be a hero
Back then that wasn't hard
Night would fall on the battle zone
And we could all go home

You had to go and be a hero
They made a law that you had to go and fight
One more crazy war
Compulsory hero
Just try and make it home
Just try and make it home
But whose gonna make it home
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby please don't go

When the man done gone
When the man done gone
When the man done gone down to the county farm
He got the shackles on
Baby, please don't go
Don't leave me

I'll be a dog
I'll be a dog, woah
I'll be a dog kiss your way down there
When you walk along
Baby, please don't go

Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby, please don't go

No baby, please don't leave me
Why must you go away and do this to me, baby
I wanna suffer for you, suffer, suffer
Oh baby, please don't go
No!

Baby, baby, baby, please don't go, please don't go
Don't go and leave me, please don't go
Baby, humm
Baby, ahah
Oh don't go, no don't go
Oh don't go, no don't go
Ah don't go, don't go so slow
Oh don't go, no don't go

Why must you leave me lying on my back
Going across left side of the track
Found yourself a new man I know
So baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go

No no no no
Oh please, please don't leave me
I don't want to be left alone baby
Ah don't go, don't go, don't go
No!
In the silence I think of you
I send a message
And hope it gets through
Think of the distance
Think of the miles
Over the valleys could take a while 

I miss the people
I miss the fun
You're my aberration
She's my only one 

And I imagine you're standing here
It's subliminal so inspirational
Man of the world for all the good reasons
Take away the pain and drink the wine 

I miss the people
You miss the fun
You're my aberration

All alone, on my own
Since I walked out on you, I walked out on me, now it's gone
And you, what to do
There's so much time,and so many nights to get through
Oh why do we play, and why do we lose
It's a dangerous life we live, we two

We are fools, we make all these rules
We make it so hard to find love, to feel free, to be fresh outta school
And now, what of romance
Do we know that life is sweeter when we're taking a chance
So why do we run, and why do we cry
It's a crazy life we life, you and I

Carousels and wishing wells were the things we loved
To fly away in a big balloon was what she talked of, oh...

Alone, out on my own
I just wander the streets and stare at the places we've known
And now, what of myself
Can I go on pretending a love for somebody else
Oh why do we play, and why do we lose
It's a dangerous life we live, we two

Carousels and wishing wells were the things we loved
Why did we play, why did we stay alone, we two
To fly away in a big balloon was what she talked of
Why did we love and leave the memory of we two
Now she is gone, I'm left to carry on

They said love hurts
I wrote that book
I climbed that wall
I had one look
But you just came around, to say hello

The streets were filled with guilty hearts
And here was I right from the start
And I lost everything when I lost you

So tell me why-y-y-y
Should I let you go
Give me 20 good reasons
I need to know, yeah

And at that point
There was no pain
There was no sky
There was no rain fall
All there was was you, and your sweet face

But life is life
And things will change
Like scenes upon an actor's stage
Tomorrow comes today
For all we know

So tell me baby why-y-y-y
Should I let you go
Give me 20 good reasons
I need to know, yeah

Give me 20 good reasons
Give me 20 good reasons
Give me 20 good reasons
To let you go

So tell me baby why-y-y-y
Should I let you go
Give me 20 good reasons
I need to know, yeah

Tell me baby why-y-y-y
Should I let you go, yeah
Give me 20 good reasons
I need to know, yeah

Give me 20 good reasons
Give me 20 good reasons
Give me 20 good reasons

She said that she was leavin'
I said I don't believe it
She said it, but she-ee
I know that she can't have enough
With the thi-ings that I bought you-ou
That ni-ight
Talk to me, don't talk to me, please...
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Leave me alo-one, oh-oh-oh
Leave me alo-one, oh-oh-oh
Leave me alo-one, oh-oh-oh
Leave me alo-one
I told you anythin' I could
Just to catch you in the mood
Yeah I told you that ni-ight
Now that I've got you where I need
Will you be eternally
Will you do it, will you-ou
Talk to me, don't talk to me, please
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Leave me al-one, oh-oh-oh
Leave me al-one, oh-oh-oh
Leave me al-one, oh-oh-oh
Leave me al-one
Talk to me, don't talk to me, please
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Leave me alo-one, oh-oh-oh
Leave me alo-one, oh-oh-oh
Leave me alo-one, oh-oh-oh
Leave me alo-one
Do you have the decency to go-o-o
So hard finding inspiration
I knew you'd find me crying
Tell those girls with rifles for minds
That their jokes don't make me laugh
They only make me feel like dying
In an unguarded moment

So long, long between mirages
I knew you'd find me drinking
Tell those men with horses for hearts
That their jibes don't make me bleed
They only make me feel like shrinking
In an unguarded moment

So deep, deep without a meaning
I knew you'd find me leaving
Tell those friends with cameras for eyes
That their hands don't make me hang
They only make me feel like breathing
In an unguarded moment

So we've already established the fact that
things are gonna be different in the future baby.
And you've reiterated the fact that you don't
want to get into something that's just gonna have to end later.
Now I know our lives are changing and I've seen
it coming for a while too, don't get me wrong.
And I've been going outta town baby it's gonna happen more,
we gotta be strong but now

While I'm gone
Just be a fly on the wall
You know
I'm thinking about you

Just wait and see
You gotta hear what I say
I'm in love with you
I'm not so far away

Someday, someday
I will be here babe
Someday, someday
I will be the one babe
Someday, someday
I will be here babe
Someday, someday
I will be the one babe

I know you gotta go to university and I'm just trying to make some cash to follow my dreams.
But please don't say we're too busy to give each other the time and support we need
I know we gotta work our jobs and make some money to get by in this expensive world.
Don't let that overtake the fact that before all that, you were still my girl.

While I'm gone
Just be a fly on the wall
You know
I'm talking about you

Just wait and see
You gotta hear what I say
I'm in love with you
I'm not so far away

Someday, someday
I will be here babe
Someday, someday
I will be the one babe
Someday, someday
I will be here babe
Someday, someday
I will be the one babe

Someday, someday
I'll know that you love me
Someday, someday
Sorry that I'm leaving
Someday, someday
I will be here babe
Someday, someday
I will be the one babe

I'm in love with you
I'm not so far away

Someday, someday
I will be here babe
Someday, someday
I will be the one babe
Someday, someday
I will be here babe
Someday, someday
I will be the one babe

Someday, someday
I'll know that you love me
Someday, someday
I just need you here with me
Don't have to try
Love will take us there babe
Someday, someday
I will be the one babe

Someday, someday
Look towards the sky babe
Someday, Someday
There's no need to cry babe
I know that you're always what I want babe
I will be the one babe
Someday,
I will be the one babe
Someday,
I just need you here with me
I fidget with the digit dots and cry an anxious tear
As the XU-1 connects the spot
But the matrix grid don't care
Get a message to my mother
What number would she be
There's a million angry citizens
Looking down their tubes at me

Com-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-puter-puter, puter games
Com-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-puter-puter-puter-puter, computer games

There's safety in numbers, they say
'Cause the figures never lie
No perfect persons ever noticed one computer die
I'm programmed to a schedule
What will the answer be
Is it suicide run till the work gets done
'Cause the matrix grid don't say

Com-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-puter-puter, puter games
Com-pu-pu-pu-pu-puter-puter-puter-puter, computer games

Jammed up tight by red traffic lights
Advance one level on green
These opportune commuters
They're blasting on thier hooters
I fidget with the digit dots
Frustration rules out there
As the XU-1 connects the spot
But the matrix grid don't care

Com-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-puter-puter, puter games
Com-pu-pu-pu-pu-puter-puter-puter-puter, computer games
Com-pu-pu-pu-pu-puter-puter-puter-puter, computer games
Com-pu-pu-pu-pu-puter-puter-puter-puter, computer games

I'm primitive
I'm a primitive man
Got a primitive girl
We make primitive love
I'm a stoneage Romeo
I got a spaceage Juliet
We make primitive loving
'Cause I ain't got a T.V. set

I'm primitive
That's what I am
I'm your prime mate
I wanna be your man
I want you, darling
You know I'm hip
Fly me to Venus
In a real gone rocket ship , I said
(Ah, ah) I'm primitive
(Ah, ah) I'm primitive
You know what that means

I'm a primitive man
I said I am
You're up to date
I can't wait
I'm a stoneage Romeo
Be my spaceage Juliet
We'll take guitars to Mars
And hit the discotech, come on

(Ah, ah) I'm primitive
(Ah, ah) I mean it, baby
(Ah, ah) speak my language?
(Ah, ah) man, you're out of this world
(Mars needs guitars) so, like, your cave or mine?
(Mars needs guitars) you don't like this long hair?
(Mars needs guitars) yeah, take that crazy
(Mars needs guitars) I'm primitive
(Mars needs guitars) primitive
(Mars needs guitars) I ain't no square
Now should you expect to see something that you hadn't seen
In somebody you'd known since you were sixteen; 
if love is a bolt from the blue, then what is that bolt but a glorified screw?
and that doesn't hold nothing together
Far from these nonsense bars and their nowhere music it's making me sick
And I know it's making you sick
There's nothing there, it's like eating air
It's like drinking gin with nothing else in
And that doesn't hold me together.

But for one crowded hour, you were the only one in the room
And I sailed around all those bumps in the night to your beacon in the gloom
I thought I had found my golden September in the middle of that purple June
But one crowded hour would lead to my wreck and ruin

And I know you like your boys to take their medicine
From the bowl with a silver spoon
Who run away with the dish and scale the fish by the silvery light of the moon
Who were taught from the womb to believe till the tomb 
That as far as their bleeding eyes see
Is a pleasure pen, meant for them, builded and rent for them
Not for the likes of me
Not for the like of you and me

And for one crowded hour, you were the only one in the room
And I sailed around all those bumps in the night to your beacon in the gloom
I thought I had found my golden September in the middle of that purple June
But one crowded hour would lead to my wreck and ruin

Oh but the green-eyed harpy of the salt land
She takes into hers my hand
She says, "Boy I know you're lying
Oh but then, so am I,"
And to this I said "Oh well."

Well put me in a cage full of lions, I learned to speak lion
In fact I know the language well
I picked it up while I was versing myself in the languages they speak in hell
That night, the silence gave birth to a baby
They took it away to her silent dismay
And they raised it to be a lady
Now she can't keep her mouth shut

And for one crowded hour, you were the only one in the room
And I sailed around all those bumps in the night to your beacon in the gloom
I thought I had found my golden September in the middle of that purple June
But one crowded hour would lead to my wreck and ruin

For one crowded hour, you were the only one in the room
Well I played a few songs for those bumps in the night
In fact I played this very tune
You said, "What is this six-stringed instrument but an adolescent loom?"
And one crowded hour would lead to my wreck and ruin.

When I first met your mother
I was playing in a bar
She walked in with my girlfriend
My foolish girlfriend brought her there

She looked so pretty and dangerous
As she brushed back her hair
And I was not the only one
Taking notice in that bar

When I first met your ma...

When I first kissed your mother
I was single once again
We walked through Fitzroy Gardens
There she took my hand

We could not stop our kissing
Then she whispered in my ear
"Well, soon you'll get to know me
So let's not go too far"

When I first kissed your ma...

Love like a bird flies away
You'll find out the only way
Love like a bird flies away

When we first lay together
Inside her father's house
We tried so to be quiet
As we held each other close

Then her dad came pounding
And kicked me out of there
I walked two miles in Melbourne rain
But I could have walked ten more

When I first loved your ma...

I couldn't figure why
You couldn't give me what everybody needs
I shouldn't let you kick me when I'm down
My baby
I find out everybody know that
You've been using me
I'm surprised you
Let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover
And look inside your heart
We gotta level before we go
And tear this love apart

There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me
You win again
So little time
We do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
You win again
Some never try
But if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be
Following you

Oh baby I shake you from now on
I'm gonna break down your defenses
One by one
I'm gonna hit you from all sides
Lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from
Taking you

You better beware, I swear
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside
The greatest love of all

Good evening Adelaide, how ya feelin'? - Alright!
On behalf of the band and myself, we'd like to say welcome
As you know we've got a brand new album out
This is my brand new single off the album, 'Ladies and Gentlemen - Marcia Hines'

Oh I, I can't remember when I felt this high
Must be somethin' special about
The way you're lovin' me tonight
You know that-a I

Lovin' you the way I do
Has made me feel like a shipping store
Shining brighter, shining more

Without you
There's somethin' very special about you
You're all I ever think about, it's true-ue-ue-ue (true)
It's you, talk about you...ou

'Til you came along and you picked me u-up
Yes you did, oh yeah, yes you did
Oh and, now, starting out a brand new-ew life
In any thing I say and do, it's all about you now
Givin' me a new world
And I wonder how I ever got along
Without you, there's somethin' very special about you
You're all I ever think about, it's true-ue-ue-ue, baby it's you
Talk about you...ou
Oh yeah-eah
Talkin' 'bout you baby, it's only you

Talk about you... oh-oh, 'bout you
Something very special about you
You're all I ever think ab

Get on the A train
Get on the right track
If you got a problem tell me
I can fix that
And if you got the rigging baby
I got the boat
And if you got a castle
Well you know I got the moat
(it's alright)
If you need some lower level
I'll be your elevator
If you want a sure glide
And if you need some time baby I got forever
I got your stuff ain't that enough?

Apple eyes drinking strawberry wine together
You and I and a blueberry sky forever

Now if you're feeling hot
On account of the sun
I got the body lotion if you wanna get some
And if you want some money
Ha I got a gold mine

And if you need direction
I'm a one way sign
(That's alright)
If you need a new kind of rhythm
I got a lemon bass that plays in apricot time
Sagittarius or Leo or Libran
I'll be your zodiac on a different star track

Hit it Girl
I Think I love You
Ohhhhhh

Apple eyes drinking strawberry wine together
You Got A Problem I Can Fix That
You and I and a blueberry sky forever
I got the body lotion if you wanna get some lotion, babe
Apple eyes drinking strawberry wine together
Together, Together, Together, Together
You and I and a blueberry sky forever
Forever

Taking her seat at the bar
She don't talk to anyone
Plane leaving soon for afar
Where she don't know anyone
She thinks of her precious time
There's no-one she leaves behind
Who could change her mind

Is this the way it's gonna be forever
Is this the way it's gonna be forever
Is this the way it's gonna be
Forever now

Take a whole life's lonliness
Wrap it up in some tenderness
Send it off to some emptiness
With all my love
Cos it's only you and me
There'll be nothing we need to see
Only one thing can set you free
Is all my love

Making his way down the stairs
He can't help but looking back
Thinks of the things that they shared
There'll be no more turning back
He thinks of the day they met
The words that she said of love
He just can't forget

Just the way they wanna be forever
Just the way they wanna be forever
Tell me it will always be
Forever now

Take a whole life's lonliness
Wrap it up in some tenderness
Send it off to some emptiness
With all my love
It's only you and me
There'll be nothing we need to see
Only one thing can set you free
Is all my love
It's only you and me
There'll be nothing we need to see
Only one thing can set you free
Is all our love, oh yeah

Since since, since since your gone away
I hope that you had a better day
Tried to call round the other day
Instead i had a go-kart
Go-kart
Living in another space
Mistake y-yeah

I hope the police will go away
I hope the police will go away
Their sirens bug me and so do all their radar's
Radar's
Living in another space
Mistake
Thank's i'm over it

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah yeah y-y-yeah

Sweet child your such a princess now
I love the rainbow on your brow
I love your rainbow, oh no it's winter
Winter
Living in another space
Mistake
Thank's i'm over it

There's a demon in the bottle
A preacher in the yard
What's that crashin' in the cellar
Who's tearin' up the boulevard
Someone's roped up in the back seat
Ain't no room left in the trunk
She needs some vital information
He spittin' out the same old junk
Collect that package at the station
Clean those stains from your dress
No need to make a reservation
The signal master don't care less
Arm-in-arm together we'll meet the midnight train
Safe as hell together we'll beat the drivin' rain
Sleep through the hurricane
Creepin' down the fire escape in someone else's hat and cape
Hurlin' curses at the moon, hummin' some forgotten tune
Cuttin' through the dead of night air, know the place
I'll meet you there
Broken glass and dried up mud, leakin' gas and butcher's blood
There's poison in the bottle
Mad prophet's in his grave
One more bullet in this chamber
Ain't no time to misbehave
There's been talk about salvation
It was just a playful romp
It could be my imagination
But somethin's movin' in the swamp

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)
Stepping out in my deadly red shoes
Stylin' up cause I'm wearing something new
Tidda girl had got her eyes up off the ground
Keeping time to the rythmn of the city sounds

Why don't you come join my party
Let's move it till the break of dawn
I gotta here that music ringing
Bring it on

Tell the blackvine singing out foreverone to come
The word is out drift on down
Come on and have some fun
Tie your hair up let your hair down fling it everywhere
Young and old gather 'round hear the laughter in the air

Why don't you come join my party
Let's move it till the break of dawn
I gotta here that music ringing
Bring it on

Got my eye on a brother hanging right outside his block
Feeling shame to ask his name hey but I know that I've got luck
Don't hold back let it out thats what community's about
Come along to my house bring friends and family around

Why don't you come join my party
Let's move it till the break of dawn
I gotta here that music ringing
Bring it on

Why don't you come join my party
Let's move it till the break of dawn
I gotta here that music ringing
Bring it on

I gotta hear that music ringing
Bring it on
Blood drips from my lips and paints a vivid picture of you

My tears seep into the soil and poison all the rivers

Deny me of my sky and feel the wrath inside me

My arms, your casket, my eyes, a doorway to my soul

I can't die

I am forever

Blood drips from my lips and paints a vivid picture of you

My tears seep into the soil and poison all the rivers

Deny me of my sky and feel the wrath inside me

Fragile, immortal creature, a shadow of myself

I can't die

I am forever
Took a lie, took a lie, took a lifetime
Took a lie, took a lie, took a lifetime
Driven under 20k of rain
I had to crawl, I had to beg
I had to pay for it through the nose
To get into this tiny shiftless room
With the barheater broken
And the stale chips in the oven
And the fly there on the table
With its legs stuck in the butterblock
Well here it is, here it is
The one place that's small enough to hold a finger tight
A well-oiled rat's nest on a shapeless summer night
Shapeless summer night
I fanged it, I fanged it
I fanged it, I fanged it
I fanged it, I fanged it
I fanged it, I fanged it...
Took a lie, took a lie, took a lifetime
It took a lie, took a lie, took a lifetime
We made the whole building sway
Made the whole city shudder
You off in one corner
And me back here in the other...
Well here it is
Here it is
The one place that's small enough to hold a finger tight
A well-oiled rat's nest on a... shapeless summer night
Shapeless summer night
I fanged it, I fanged it
I fanged it, I fanged it
I fanged it, I fanged it
I fanged it, I fanged it...
(Michael Hutchence/Jon Farriss)

Oh so fine, we were trying
Out of nowhere just in time
Let you take me deep down the river
Kiss the changes that shape my life
Always left behind
All the tracks that I could find
Do do-do-do-do, do do-do-do-do
All these scars are mine

I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever

All the lies you find, all the truth you see
Rise and fall, but I know what's mine
Here we lie looking up to empty sky
And the promises we find
I'm not the first one to ask why, yeah
Do do-do-do-do, do do-do-do-do
All we ever try

I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever
I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever

Let you take me deep down the river
Kiss the changes that shape my life
Do do-do-do-do, do do-do-do-do
All these scars are mine
Do do-do-do-do, do do-do-do-do
All these scars are mine

I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever
All the lies you find, all the truth you see
Rise and fall, but I know what's mine

I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever
All the lies you find, all the truth you see
Rise and fall, but I know what's mine

I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever
All the lies you find, all the truth you see
Rise and fall, but I know what's mine

Sometimes things can get crazy
But that's no reason to go run and hide
I haven't heard from you lately
The days and nights just keep on passing by
Well I guess that it's over
But I have no fear in letting go
I gotta look to the future
It's time to face the music
And make it on my own, so

Don't cry for me baby
I'm operating on a natural high
Don't you cry for me baby
The past is over now
So kiss it goodbye

Don't you stand in my shadow
'Cause when you do I take it personal
I guess it's time to let you go
Can't sit here waiting for a miracle
I gotta get a reaction
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Communication seems to be a no
(no, no)
What happened to the attraction
If I don't get an answer
I think I'd better go so

Don't cry for me baby
I'm operating on a natural high
Don't you cry for me baby
The past is over now, kiss it goodbye

Don't you cry for me
Don't she'd a tear for me
I'm gonna be alright
(Alright now)
Don't you cry for me
I'm not in misery
I can't wait

I'm gonna have me a good time

Don't cry for me baby
I'm operating on a natural high
Don't you cry for me baby
The past is over now, kiss it goodbye

So dry your eyes
No need to cry
No time for sad goodbyes
It's time to go
Nothing to show
So baby don't you cry

I see you standing on the corner with your dress so high
(With your dress so high)
And all the cars slow down as they go driving by
(As they go driving by)
Thought you said you had some place to go
What you doing up here putting it all on show?

Darling, it hurts to see you down Darlinghurst tonight

Do you remember, baby, how we laughed and cried?
(How we laughed and cried)
We said we'd be together 'til the day we die
('Til the day we die)
How could something so good turn so bad?
I'd do it all again 'cause you're the best I've ever had

Darling, it hurts to see you down Darlinghurst tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Rock on

[Guitar Solo]

See that man with the glad hands?
I want to kill him but it wouldn't be right
Now here comes another man with the glad bags
I want to break him but it's not my fight
In one hand and out the other
Baby, I don't even know why you bother

Darling, it hurts to see you down Darlinghurst tonight

[Instrumental Break]

I see you standing on the corner with your dress so high
(With your dress so high)
And all the cars slow down as they go driving by
(As they go driving by)
In one hand and out the other
Baby, I don't even know why you bother

Darling, it hurts to see you down Darlinghurst tonight
Darling, it hurts to see you down Darlinghurst tonight
What'd I say?
Darling, it hurts to see you down Darlinghurst tonight

For so long
You and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you is more then strong, girl
Take it from me
If you give a little more then you're asking for your love will turn the key
Darling, mine
I would wait forever for those lips of wine
Build my world around you, darling, this love will shine girl
Watch it and see
If you give a little more then you're asking for, your love will turn the key

I, I just want to be your everything
Open up the heaven in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me and not some puppet on a string
Oh, if I stay here without you, darling, I will die
I want you laying in the love I have to bring
I'd do anything to be your everything

Darling, for so long
You and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you is more then strong, girl
Take it from me
If you give a little more then you're asking for  tour love will turn the key

I, I just want to be your everything
Open up the heaven in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me and not some puppet on a string
Oh, if I stay here without you, darling, I will die
I want you laying in the love I have to bring
I'd do anything to be your everything

I, I just want to be your everything
Open up the heaven in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me and not some puppet on a string
Oh, if I stay here without you, darling, I will die
I want you laying in the love I have to bring
I'd do anything to be your everything
Macainsh

You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed (X 4)

You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed
Yeah that's what your girlfriend said
You just like me 'cos I give you some head
You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed

Well I'll meet you in the pub at two minutes to ten
You're all ready to go
Six bottles of beer and a sneer on your face
I'd run but I'm much too slow

You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed (X 4)

At half past one I'm flat on the floor
Caught like a rat in a trap
Fifteen times a week and you still want more
God you talk such crap

You just like 'cos I'm good in bed (X 4)

You imagine yourself as Mick Jagger's girlfriend
He wouldn't even spit in your eye
I bet you he don't get raped every weekend
I feel so weak I could die

You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed (X 4)

You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed
Yeah that's what your girlfriend said
You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed
You just like me 'cos I'm good in bed
I found her on a night of fire and noise
Wild bells rang in a wild sky
I knew from that moment on
I'll love her till the day that I died
And I kissed away a thousand tears
My lady of the Various Sorrows
Some begged, some borowed, some stolen
Some kept safe for tomorrow
On and endless night, silver star spangled
The bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle

Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?

She was given to me to put things right
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside her
Still I seemed so obselete and small
I found God and all His devils inside her
In my bed she cast the blizzard out
A mock sun blazed upon her head
So completely filled with light she was
Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad
Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled
And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle

Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?

She had a heartful of love and devotion
She had a mindful of tyranny and terror
Well, I try, I do, I really try
But I just err, baby, I do, I error
So come find me, my darling one
I'm down to the grounds, the very dregs
Ah, here she comes, blocking the sun
Blood running down the inside of her legs
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled
bAnd the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle

Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?

All things move toward their end
I knew before I met her that I would lose her
I swear I made every effort to be good to her
I made every effort not to abuse her
Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles
And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle

Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?
Pass me that lovely little gun
My dear, my darting one
The cleaners are coming, one by one
You don't even want to let them start

They are knocking now upon your door
They measure the room, they know the score
They're mopping up the butcher's floor
Of your broken little hearts

O children

Forgive us now for what we've done
It started out as a bit of fun
Here, take these before we run away
The keys to the gulag

O children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice

Here comes Frank and poor old Jim
They're gathering round with all my friends
We're older now, the light is dim
And you are only just beginning

O children

We have the answer to all your fears
It's short, it's simple, it's crystal dear
It's round about, it's somewhere here
Lost amongst our winnings

O children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice

The cleaners have done their job on you
They're hip to it, man, they're in the groove
They've hosed you down, you're good as new
They're lining up to inspect you

O children

Poor old Jim's white as a ghost
He's found the answer that was lost
We're all weeping now, weeping because
There ain't nothing we can do to protect you

O children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice

Hey little train! We are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train ain't even left the station

Hey, little train! Wait for me!
I once was blind but now
I see Have you left a seat for me?
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?

Hey little train! Wait for me!
I was held in chains but now I'm free
I'm hanging in there, don't you see
In this process of elimination

Hey little train! We are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
It's beyond my wildest expectation

Hey little train! We are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train ain't even left the station

Pickin' up the pieces up off the floor
How was I to know there was gonna be a war
Words of sorrow and words of spi-ite
Ringin' in my head right through the night

Oh-oh-oh-oh-woh
Woke up this mornin', it's a rainin' again
Startin' to wonder if it's somethin' I said
Words of sorrow and words of spi-ite
Ringin' in my head right through the night
Don't you know it's a cry-yin' sha-ame
When you've got yourself to bla-ame


Up all night with a conscience fight
I just can't sleep so I put on the light
The sheets are wet with anxiety sweat
Mornin's gonna come but it ain't here yet

You've got yourself

Oh I wake up feeling the same way every day
Aching numb with the pain that I can't chase away
So I'm wondering who's taking up your sacred precious time
Living from day to day without a single sign
Would I lie? Oh no

One word, one letter, one line
And I'd feel a whole lot better
One look would way it's alright
And I'd feel a whole lot better

My heart breaks the way you turn your back and carry on
And my head hurts 'cause I just can't work out why it all went wrong
So I'm wondering, oh the more I think the less I understand
Leaving is easy when you know you're in command
Would I lie? oh no

One word, one letter, one line
And I'd feel a whole lot better
One look would way it's alright
And I'd feel a whole lot better

Would I try, try to keep
Just a little something that means nothing to me
Ooh why pretend that I'm in that deep
Lord, I thought you knew me, ooh yeah

One word, one letter, one line
And I'd feel a whole lot better
One look would way it's alright
And I'd feel a whole lot better

You walked in my life, with and angels smile
How could I have known, the hunger locked inside
We can start a fire, but we can't control the flame
Now I just can't wait, to feel that heat again
And in the middle of the night you cry . . 

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I got a burning heart
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me

Just seems like yesterday, I was running alone
I turned my back on love, but baby I was wrong
Do I miss your touch, do I tell myself a lie
Can't get enough, when I'm lying by your side
And in the middle of the night I cry . 

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I got a burning heart
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me

Shadows moving on the wall
Slowly we begin to fall
Lying in a pool of sweat
Another night I can't forget

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I got a burning heart
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
You've lived on beans and rice
And fell for Jesus Christ
And if your pants are nice
Mother nature's son
Never made sense until you begun
To play the kids for fun

Maybe start a TV show
A service in day-glo
Watch your ethics grow

Mother nature's kid
Just keep the money hid
As if you never did sell

Mother nature's son
Never made sense until you begun
To play the kids for fun

You've never tasted hell
'cause Judas signed you well
And if the story sells

Mother nature's kid
Just keep the money hid
As if you never did sell

Mother nature's son
Never made sense until you begun
To play the kids for fun
Jaimme's got a girl
Don't think things are gonna be the same
He ain't coming out and drinking tonight
Think he's gonna change his name
We can't work it out
He ain't punching walls anymore
I'm ain't gonna wake up now
Find you on my floor
A game's a game, you don't want it being the same
But you sure ain't like you were yesterday
But go on and try it
And if it's true, it just ain't my place to say
But you sure ain't like you were yesterday
Go on and try it

Phone sure sounds dead
My pocket sure feel tight
The things I promised not to do with you today
I sure need to tonight
But it's all working out
Just like they said it would be
You ain't gonna fall on my floor
From now on it's just we three
We stumble into each other's lives
And we knock somethings over
Try not to make a sound

Each time you reach out
A new shout or shine on
We run in and fall out
Fumble around for the key

I'll always keep the light on for you
You try so hard to be alive
What else can you do
But close your eyes
You can't see the beautiful way
When you're burning so bright

Your half-penny eyes
Smile like a fire sale
Everyone's a suspect
The horses won't move up the rail

I'll always keep the light on for you
You try so hard to be alive
What else can you do
But close your eyes
You can't see the beautiful way
When you're burning so bright

Your sadness, thief
Waits in the hallway
With mail on the floor
And two birds in the chimney

I'll always keep the light on for you
You try so hard to be alive
What else can you do
But close your eyes
You can't see the beautiful way
When you're burning so bright

I'll always keep the light on for you
You try so hard to be alive
What else can you do
But close your eyes
And you can't see the beautiful way
When you're burning so bright
So bright
Burning so bright
How many cabs in New York City, how many angels on a pin?
How many notes in a saxophone, how many tears in a bottle of gin?
How many times did you call my name, knock at the door but you couldn't get in?
I know I've been careless
I've been wrapped up in a shell nothing could get through to me
Acted like I didn't know I had friends or family
I saw worry in their eyes, it didn't look like fear to me
I know I've been careless (I took bad care of this) 
Like a mixture in a bottle, like a frozen-over lake
Like a longtime painted smile I got so hard I had to crack
You were there, you held the line, you're the one that brought me back 

I know I've been careless (I lost my tenderness)
I've been careless (I took bad care of this)
How many cabs in New York City, how many angels on a pin?
How many notes in a saxophone, how many tears in a bottle of gin?
How many times did you call my name, knock at the door but you couldn't get in?
How many stars in the milky way, how many way can you lose a friend?
The faces in the photograph have faded
And I can't believe he looks so much like me
For it's been ten years today
Since I left for Old Cork Station
Sayin' I won't be back till the drivin's done

For the rain never falls on the dusty Diamantina
And a drover finds it hard to change his mind
For the years have surely gone
Like the drays from Old Cork Station
And I won't be back till the drivin's done

Well it seems like the sun comes up each mornin'
Sets me up and takes it all away
For the dreaming by the light
Of the camp fire at night
Ends with the burning by the day

Sometimes I think I'll settle back in Sydney
But it's been so long it's hard to change my mind
For the cattle trail goes on and on
And the fences roll forever
And I won't be back till the drivin's done

Get down, get down, little Henry Lee
And stay all night with me
You won't find a girl in this damn world
That will compare with me
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee

I can't get down and I won't get down
And stay all night with thee
For the girl I have in that merry green land
I love far better than thee
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee

She leaned herself against a fence
Just for a kiss or two
And with a little pen-knife held in her hand
She plugged him through and through
And the wind did roar and the wind did moan
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee

Come take him by his lilly-white hands
Come take him by his feet
And throw him in this deep deep well
Which is more than one hundred feet
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee

Lie there, lie there, little Henry Lee
Till the flesh drops from your bones
For the girl you have in that merry green land
Can wait forever for you to come home
And the wind did howl and the wind did moan
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
~~~

He left a card, a bar of soap and a scrubbing brush next to a note
That said "use these down to your bones"
And before I knew I had shiny skin and it felt easy being clean like him
I thought "this one knows better than I do"

A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
He tried to cut me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could've gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?

So the next one came with a bag of treats, 
she smelled like sugar and spoke like the sea
And she told me don't trust them, trust me
Then she pulled at my stitches one by one, 
looked at my insides clicking
her tongue and said "This will all have to come undone"

A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
She tried to cut me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?

I think I realized just in time, although my old self was hard to find
You can bathe me in your finest wine but I'll never give you mine
'Cos I'm a little bit tired of fearing that I'll be the bad fruit nobody
buys
Tell me, did you think we'd all dream the same?

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?
Could you leave me with a scar?

You can say love's forever
And find it never stays
In you I've recovered
The one thing that must remain
I'm tired of a world undone
I've figured out you're my setting sun
It's cruel
The way I'm needing you
I guess I'll play the fool
It's my heart, not my mind and it's taking over
Cruel
Suddenly it's true
No longer can I choose
It's in you I'm defined and there is no other
Oh it's Cruel
Oh it's Cruel

I can hold back emotions
Get lost in a maze
But this urgency tells me
I just can't refrain
Dreams have come and passed me by
But now it's time to redefine (yeah)
It's cruel
The way I'm needing you
I guess I'll play the fool
It's my heart, not my mind and it's taking over
Cruel
Suddenly it's true
No longer can I choose
It's in you I'm defined and there is no other

I've seen it come and go so many times
But this is critical, the truth
I can't hide
(Can't hide)
And I don't know why

(And I don't know why, I don't know why)
Yeah, oh yeah
(So cruel)
So cruel, oh
It's cruel the way I'm loving you, oh yeah
(So cruel)
Cruel the way I'm loving you

It's cruel
The way I'm needing you
I guess I'll play the fool
(It's cruel the way I'm loving you)
(Baby now I know it's true)
It's my heart, not my mind and it's taking over
Cruel
Suddenly it's true
No longer can I choose
It's in you I'm defined and there is no other

[Continue to fade]
Let me wander north to the homestead
Way out further on there to roam
By a gully in flood let me linger
When the summery sunshine has flown
Where the logs tangle up on the creek bed
And the clouds veil the old northern sky
And the cattle move back from the lowlands
When the rain tumbles down in July
The settlers with sad hearts are watching
The rise of the stream from the dawn
Their best crops are always in flood reach
If it rises much more they'll be gone
The cattle string out along the fences
The wind from the south races by
And the limbs from the old gums are falling
When the rain tumbles down in July
The sleeping gums on the hillside
Awaken to herds straying by
From the flats where the fences have vanished
As the storm clouds gather on high
The wheels of the wagons stop turning
The stock horse is turned out to stray
And the old station dogs are a-dozing
On the husks in the barn through the day
The drover draws rein by the river
It's years since he's seen it so high
And that's just a story of homeward
When the rain tumbles down in July
Joe spoke no English but he had a dream
And he saved up most of his pay
To bring his wife and six kids from Lebanon
And settle down here to stay

You could feel the prison of his loneliness
He wouldn't see them for years
He kept brandy behind the compressed air tanks
And he gulped it when the coast was clear

Nick the Greek collected tropical fish
Had to be a character too
Smuggled in piranha just to break the law
And he fed them on kangaroo

Bob's pride was his handlebar mustache
Said he still combed out sand
Pushed a tank through the Sahara desert
So they made him the leading hand

And the summer night shifts were long and cool
Charlie chain smoked cigars
David sweated in his speckled paint mask
As he gazed out at the stars

Crazy Charlie was a Yugoslav
His old straight eight Chevy could move
His ambition was to live on a hippie commune
When Dave told him about free love

Fred had been a farmer and a heavyweight champ
Hands like a stump jump plow
Moved the earth with a thrust of his arms
He was loading on the paint line now

And the boys made a noise every Friday night
At the bar of the Hilton Hotel
Downing pints and chewing the fat
Till the ten o'clock closing bell

It was only rumor til the foreman came
And hiding his shame with a cough
He said they're cutting back down to one shift now
They're gonna have to lay you off

Joe held his gaze and gulped a brandy
And spat it out at his feet
Bob stood bolt still looking thunderstruck
Nick swore for an hour in Greek

Their anger was spent in a rush of fire
And smoldered out of mind
When they shook hands on that last grey day
Each was in his way resigned

Then a few days later I saw old Joe
Looking like he'd aged ten years
Drunk on the tiles at the Stag Hotel
And he couldn't hold back the tears

Fred had talked of his grueling heavyweight bouts
I remembered what he'd said
There's no giving up on that killing floor
If you don't fight you're dead

If you work with your hands for your livelihood
Some day you might have to choose
When the class war rages on the factory floor
If you don't fight you lose
If you don't fight you lose
If you don't fight you lose
If you don't fight you lose
If you don't fight you lose

If you don't fight you lose
If you don't fight
If you don't fight you lose
If you don't fight you lose
I've held the seat of Bong-Bong now
Since 1963
With a well-oiled tongue, a makeup man
And prime time ABC
I used to be an auctioneer
There's not much difference
A haze of finance doctoring
And verbal flatulence
Electioneering's such a bore
Three months of bending ears
Thank Christ I only see you yobbos
Once every three years

It's a federal two-ring circus
It's called democracy
Two hundred clowns, a dour MC
And the queen's well-heeled G-G

I'm women's advisor
To the cabinet portfolios
And every week I keep well-briefed
At tea with Ms. Buttrose
Unemployment's falling
We look to better days
Because women in the workforce
Are just a passing phase
Let's get back to basics
Experience has shown
The heart is by the hearth
A woman's place is in the home

It's a federal two-ring circus
It's called democracy
Two hundred clowns, a dour MC
And the queen's well-heeled G-G

This is Sorry Folks in Canberra
The Shadow Minister For Industrial Segregation Mr. Pork
The Lord High Chanchellor of the Hinterland Mr. Cheechock
And the Leader of the alien democrats Mr. Hip were seen together today strolling together across Lake Burleigh Griffin
Their new party is to be called the media mainline party

And Mr. Hips suggestion of the slogan "Keep the customs honest" was adopted
In other Canberra news, the governor general, attending a history teachers luncheon outlined for the benefit of those present a chapter in the glorious pages of his position:

I'm a vestige of nobility
Cognac and caviar
Soires at the racetrack
And oration jocular
I had a dream that
Constitutional crisis
Loomed again
The CIA and history
Hailed the rigors of my pen
But I'd had one too many gins
How they groaned behind my back
I signed the papers upside down
And gave myself the sack

It's a federal two-ring circus
It's called democracy
Two hundred clowns, a dour MC
And the queen's well-heeled G-G

I can't hide it
So good to be here
Lost in transit
Out on a free year
There's no truth
Eying me sideways

Just a telephone booth
On a highway

I ain't hiding
There's been no breakdown
Where I'm aiming
I see the sundown
One horizon
Eying me sideways

Just a telephone booth
On a highway

Everything for miles
Is high on the silence
Everything's my way

Where I'm calling
There's no religion
No-one falling
My absolution
Is all truth
Eying me sideways

In a telephone booth
On a highway

I stand ready
For any new direction
That the sun may lead me down
Everything for miles
Is high on the silence
Everything's my way

In a telephone booth
On a highway
Playing in the dirt
We find the seeds of doubt
Don't water them with your tears
Don't think about all the years you'd rather be without

Eden lets me in
I find the seeds of love
And climb upon the highwire
I kiss and tell all my fears

Falling down the mountain
End up kissing dirt
Look a little closer
Sometimes it wouldn't hurt

Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, playing in the dirt
We find the seeds of fun
Do-do-do-do, and we scream like alleycats
Do-do-do-do, tearing down what we attack
To prove that we are one

Cutting through the night
We find the seeds of lust
And lose our minds on one intent
These passions never seem to end

You know it wouldn't hurt
Hey

I said get up, get up, get up
Get up to the top, yeah
I'm falling down the mountain
End up kissing dirt, yeah
I'm falling, falling
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I haven't always been a single man
And I haven't always lived up here
Along with all these other single men
With a ring around the bath, and a cigarette butt in my beer
And I haven't always been a lonely man
And I haven't always lived alone
And you know I haven't always drunk this much
But hey before you cut me down
Just try standing in my shoes
'Cause I don't have to hear one word of this no

On any other day
I might care what you say
But every Saturday is Father's Day
You might call it sad
You might call me mad
But I've got one- who calls me Dad

And all the other blokes that live up here
Know how to leave a man alone
They're not a bad old bunch that live up here
Ah but you know that it's not family and it's not home
What of a darlin' wife that once I had?
Well I'm pleased to say that she still talks to me
But I try not to think of what went wrong
'Cause if I say that I was right
She might say that she was right
And the only rights I care about are visiting rights yeah
We go where he wants to go
We do what he wants to do
I tell him everything I know
'Cause I'd do anything to prove
Yeah I'd do anything to prove
Sapped and stupid I lie upon the stones and I swoons
The darlig little dandelions have done their thing and changed from suns into moons
The dragons roam the shopping malls, I hear they're gonna eat our guts
If I had the strength I might pick up my sword and make some attempt to resist

Get ready to shield yourself
Grab your sap and your heaters
Get ready to shield yourself
On the night of the lotus eaters

Mmm, don't you love my baby
Mmm, and don't you love my baby anymore

They gilded my scales, they fish-bowled me and they toured me round the old aquariums
They come in their hordes to tap at the glass, the philistines and barbarians
I like floating here, it's nice, they've hung seaweed around my hips
And I do the hula for the hungry ones and the lames all throw me tips

Get ready to shield yourself
Grab your sap and your heaters
Get ready to shield yourself
On the night of the lotus eaters

Mmm, don't you love my baby
Mmm, and don't you love my baby anymore

Get ready to shield yourself
From our catastrophic leaders
Get ready to shield yourself
Grab your sap and your heaters

On the night of the lotus eaters

Now hit the streets!

Now hit the streets!

Skip de skip, up the road
Off to school you go

Don't you slip up
Or play the fool"
"Oh no Ma, Oh no Da,

Here in Motor City
Where do you get off
Riding in your pony
With the top down
Have to get it out
Have to get it in
Need love and affection
When the party begins
Aiieee
Aiieee

Here in motor city
Tell me you are real
Also say your prayers
With a funk bass feel
Call me any time
Any time you want
The door is always swinging
In this boys club
Aiieee

I get lost
Because of that way you walk
Shake that thing around
Like radios on the ground
When I get lost

Oh lay some Aretha on me

Here in motor city
See you've hit the smoke
It's not the kind of thing
That you want to bring home
Because of your old man
He won't understand
Sometimes a woman
Just needs a new man
Aiieee
Aiieee

I get lost
Because of that way you walk
Shake that thing around
Like radios on the ground
Cause when I get lost

Oh lay some Aretha on me

Here in motor city
I just want to say
Where are you hiding
When I want to play
Now my weakest link
Fell off of the chain
And I can't help you
When You're Superman

I get lost
Because of that way you walk
Shake that thing around
Like radios on the ground
Cause when I get lost

Oh lay some Aretha on me, on me
I get lost
Oh lay some Aretha on me
I get lost
Oh lay some Aretha on me, on me
Cause when I get lost
Lay some Aretha on me
On me
On me
I get lost
Oh lay some Aretha on me
Hey hey honey when I'm without you
I get a chill up and down my spine
And I, I feel so hot and the pain won't stop
Tearing at this heart of mine
And I wouldn't have it, I know I can say
And I wouldn't have it any other way

Do you like to make love with me or turn it around?
Do you like the way it feels when I hold you tight?
Do you like the way I say I'm coming on home?
I'd get you when I want you then you're on your own

Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
I'm gonna keep my body tight

Looking a little bit closer now
I've got something to say to you
And if your body touches me, I just don't know what I might do
And so hold me honey, hit on the bed
I got notions in my head

Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
I'm gonna keep my body tight

Hey hey honey when I'm without you
I get a chill up and down my spine
And I, I feel so hot and the pain won't stop
Tearing at this heart of mine
And I wouldn't have it, I know I can say
And I wouldn't have it any other way

Do you like to make love with me or turn it around?
Do you like the way it feels when I hold you tight?
Do you like the way I say I'm coming on home?
I'd take you when I want you then you're on your own

Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
She takes her dress down from the wardrobe door
Same old thing she wore a hundred times before
Looks in the mirror what does she see?
Lonely nights and misery

Nothin' to make 'em stay
Those country girls
Can't wait to get away
Those country girls

Combs her back in the usual style
Lifts up the telephone
Commences to dial
All the boys she knows are just actin' like men
She'll never call again

Pink lace and white pearls
Country Girls
Cheap scent and tight curls
Pink lace and white pearls
Country Girls
Cheap scent and tight curls

Winds her way to the central cafe
Let the jukebox waste her time away
All her yesterdays are comin' down like rain
On a smoky window pain

You are born into this world
Looking down the barrel of a gun
And those who hold the gun
Want you to work fast and die young
And if you don't work
If you don't obey
They'll make you live in fear till your dying day
Those who govern hold the gun to your head
With religions, corporations, proud of blood
They've shed

Whether it's God or the bomb
It's just the same
It's only fear under another name
And the corporate snakes coming in to feed
On that pathetic fact known as human greed
Skin and bone being raked over those hot coals
This dump never seems to give time for human soul
And all those things that we have learnt
No time for questions, you'll just get burnt
You'll just get burnt

And those words crush you flat
Like your skull's under a brick
And the fear's so damned strong
That it makes you sick
And you can see right through those eyes
That make you fear, that make you lie
And you're taught to hold high
Yet you wonder why
Dumb values forced upon you by the
Living lie
We had a cat
His name was Bill
He caught our budgie on the window sill
One holy day, one Sunday morn
Left only feathers on our back lawn
Oh no Bill, you can't do that
You silly pussy, you stupid cat
So we took him down, our family pet
And we left his balls with the family vet

Well the very next day he packed his bags
Left all his penthouse and playboy mags
How could we do it to the family vet
Go and leave his balls with the family vet
Well we get no postcards, no telephone calls
He's out in the bush somewhere, with no balls
And he's obsessed with sweet revenge
So he eats our parrots and our fairy wrens

Yes he's mortified and we all regret
That we Left his balls with the family vet

How he's highly sought by the feral choir
For his new found talent to sing much higher
Has no more time for female friends
Only parrots and fairy wrens
No sense of humor, ex-family pet
He's still angry, he's still upset
It still hurts, he can't forget
That we left his balls with the family vet

Everything looks strange to me like a recurring dream
I think I know what's coming, til it turns out wrong
I've been away, away too long
I can't change where I've been the bad I've done and seen
But my heart has a home and it got here on its own
I've been away, away too long

Been away too long
Through a doorway in the night towards the sound of cheering
I'll be gone at a minute to 12
You don't want to have to see me turn into myself
I've been away too long
There's a warmth that I miss familiar like a kiss
But the girls had no name and the singer no song
I've been away, away too long

When we burn the cane the mice all run
When the cane is burnt the mice all run
When the fire burnt out I came back home
When the cane was burnt I came back home

There's no gate and no wall in my way at all
And if Janis died for my sins even I can start again
I've been away too long
Just want to see the big picture

Just want to have my cake and eat it

Don't think about the past or the future

When all my business is defeated

But I won't take it lying down

One week in and one week out

Make sure the word gets around

Just what my story's all about

I take the world between my teeth

I put my money where my mouth is

And I walk down into the street

Brush aside every beggar that I meet

Hey sir!

You can have it all

Hey sir!

You can have it all

Yeah, I walked out into the street

And every beggar that I meet says

Hey, you gotta dollar for a drink

But who cares, who cares what I think

Credit made me what I am today

Someone will win and somebody will pay

It doesn't matter if you love anybody

Cause love will never blow your debts away

Hey sir!

You can have it all

Hey sir!

You can have it all

Hey sir!

You can have it all

Hey sir!

You can have it all
There's a fraction too much friction
There's a fraction too much friction
There's a fraction too much friction
There's a fraction too much friction

Take a typical man put him
With a typical woman then
Sit back and watch everthing slide
It's a perfectly natural
Expression of Ill will but
When will Hostilities subside?

There's a fraction too much friction
There's a fraction too much friction
Don't believe in opposing factions
What we need is some positive action
There's a fraction too much friction

It's a very old problem that
Goes back to the dark ages
The wages of original sin
Lets make it a better world
Let's shake it up boys and girls
It's never too late to begin

There's a fraction too much friction
There's a fraction too much friction
Men and woman need each other
Should be like sister and brother
There's a fraction too much friction

Looking for the man who will love his woman
Looking for the woman who will love her man

I swallowed my pride for you
My personal high's bore you
You're too wrapped up in your own world
I'm not a man for nothing
I gotta become someone
Inside this oyster there's a pearl

There's a fraction too much friction
There's a fraction too much friction
Holding on to the bygone era
Everybody shout cos we're getting nearer
There's a fraction too much friction

What we need is some positive action
What we need is some positive thought

NEW SENSATION 

Live baby live 
Now that the day is over 
I got a new sensation 
In perfect moments 
Impossible to refuse 

Sleep baby sleep 
Now that the night is over 
And the sun comes like a god 
Into our room 
All perfect light and promises 

Gotta hold on you 
A new sensation 
A new sensation 

Right now 
Gonna take you over 
A new sensation 
A new sensation 
Dream baby dream 
Of all that's come and going 
And you will find out 
In the end 
There really is 
There really is no difference 
Cry baby cry 
When you've got to get it out 
I'll be your shoulder 
You can tell me all 
Don't keep it in ya 
Well that's the reason why I'm here 
Are you ready for a new sensation 
A new sensation 
Right now 
Gonna take you on a new sensation 
A new sensation 

Hate baby hate 
When there's nothing left for you 
You're only human 
What can you do 
It'll soon be over 
Don't let your pain take over you 

Love baby love 
It's written all over your face 
There's nothing better we could do 
Than live forever 
Well that's all we've got to do 
Hey now I'm gonna take a new sensation 
A new sensation
It's no use pretending
That I understand
The hide and seek we play with facts
It changes on demand 

Tilt my hat at the sun
And the shadows they burn dark
Light me and I'll burn for you
And the love song never stops 

I like the look in your eyes
When you talk that certain way
I love the day in the life
When you know that lover's way 

Minding my own business
When you came along
Temperature's been running hot
The fever was so strong 

It's always an adventure
The fantasies we make a fact
You're the secret I desire
I can't keep that to myself 

When we're not together
It doesn't feel so bad
We could be so far apart
But our love's not sad 

It's no use pretending
'Cause I understand
The hide and seek we play with facts

Don't you get the feelin' that
You've done this kind of thing before
You've been kicked in the teeth
And now you're goin' back for more
Come with me - get out of the mess you're in
You take your life in your hand
Every time you fool around with him

He's just no good for you, why are you goin' back
You deserve a whole lot better than that

Your memory must be short
Or you find it very easy to forgive
You must be a little bit crazy
If you think that's how you ought to live

He's just no good for you, why are you goin' back
You deserve a whole lot better than that

Stop and think - while you've got the chance
Stop and think - or you'll be over your head
In a doomed roma-ance

He's just no good for you, why are you goin' back
You deserve a whole lot better than that

Don't you get the feelin' that
You've done this kind of thing before
You've been kicked in the teeth
And now you're goin' back for more and more and more-ore

He's just no good for you, why are you goin' back
You deserve a whole lot better than that
Oh he's just no good for you (that is just no good)
Why are you goin' back (that is just no good)
You deserve a whole lot better than tha-a-at
Oh he's just no good for you (that is just no good)
Why are you goin' back (that is just no good)
You deserve a whole lot better than tha-at
I spy your humble home
I see the tea towels fly
In a blinding flash
I see the years go by
memories twisted around
somebodies finger
behind me now
oh but I still remember
Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?

We go north to the ocean
we driove dso far
but last years light is shining hotter than the sun
loking for someone
in a city that I know
but I wasn't round for long
I had somewhere else to go

Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?

I see the safest place around
in that city down below
my hands are empty now
and I waving as I go

You were gone for a little while
It was a fine fine line
Between first and second thoughts
we left them all behind
Now we barely faulter
Now the long drive has begun
North to the ocean
Hotter, hotter than the sun

Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?

Racki 'em up Jim, it's your break
Set 'em up Max, it's my shout
You know I really could go a round or three
You wouldn't believe the crap I've had to deal with this week
And I'm shovelling most of it for free
"Grace under pressure" - that's what the old man said
Yeah the old man said a lo of things in his time
Well, fighting a bull's one thing but fighting bullshit's another
And around here you know the bullshit just never seems to die

I just want nothing on my mind

Christ hell! It's warming up in here, listen to that guitar player will ya
Do you think anyone could tell him to turn down?
Where'd Jim go, sorry I didn't catch your name
It's impossible to hear a word above that sound
I'm a little thristy, I'm running our of money, hey I'm a legend not a star
And I'll talk to anyone yes I will
Just as long as I can keep ripping the scab off those cold little vicious ones as they keep coming right across the bar

I just want nothing on my mind

There was a man on the radio today talking about the young people
Said we should listen to the young people, said they're a victim of conspiracy
The young people, Jesus! What's that supposed to mean?
I never did one damn good thing 'til I was over thirty
I'm gonna get up in the morning, chug-a-lug a coffee
Get on my bike and ride away
Find me a beach with a nice little break and I'm gonna catch wave after wave after wave

Until there's nothing on my mind

(whoever brought me here will have to take me home)

Night Owl
NIGHT OWL
By Little River Band
There is a bar right across the street
He's got a need he just can't beat
Out on the floor he shuffles his feet away
He'll get the girl 'cause he looks so fine
He's gonna win her every time
He knows he will, he's dressed to kill, he's a night owl
(Move on, there's a howl of a night owl calling)
(To belong, she's crying in the night)
(Be strong, find the heart of a night owl falling)
Stay up till dawn, (until the night is gone)
What will become of the restless kind
Where do they go when they've done their time
Wearing their hearts out on the line for all to see
Must be gypsy in their soul
They have a need to rock and roll
They always will, they're out there still they're night owls
(Move on, there's a howl of a night owl calling)
(To belong, she's crying in the night)
(Be strong, find the heart of a night owl falling)
Stay up till dawn, (until the night is gone)

(Be strong, find the heart of a night owl falling)
Stay up till dawn, until the night is gone

Hit it!

Oh well now!

When I was a little girl
My mama sat me down and told me all about the world
Well now she, she told me true
She said one day you would probably break my heart in two

But now I, I beg to differ baby
I don't take it the way you like to give it
Now look at you, on your knees
Sweet as sugar baby, sayin' please

I said I'm looking at you, well
Said I'm looking at you, uh-huh
I said I'm looking at you

Now who the hell are you
To treat me like that?
I don't care where you been, what you done
Or where you're at
Now who the hell are you
To act the way you do?
You won't be smiling by the time I'm through with you
Now who the hell are you?

Oh well now!

Ain't no cheating, ain't no lying
Ain't no explaining, justifying going on around here
Now stand up, and be a man
If you want it, come and get it baby, catch me if you can

Come on and catch me if you can
Well you know that, if you want it
Come and get it, if you want it - ow!

Now who the hell are you
To treat me like that?
I don't care where you been, what you done
Or where you're at
Now who the hell are you
To act the way you do?
You won't be smiling by the time I'm through with you
Now who the hell are you?

There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer?)
There's a devil waiting outside your door
It is bucking and braying and pawing at the floor
And he's howling with pain and crawling up the walls
There's a devil waiting outside your door

He's shouting your name and he's asking for more
There's a devil waiting outside your door

There's a devil crawling along your floor
There's a devil crawling along your floor
With a trembling heart, he's coming through your door
With his straining sex in his jumping paw
There's a devil crawling along your floor

And he's lame and he's blind

Give him more

It's not what you do, it's just the way that you do it makes me feel this way
It's not what I see, it's what I read in the looks you've been giving me
Now make no mistake I'm not sure I can take anymore of this waiting game
If I had my way I'd like to hear you say
You kind of feel the same way too
So, When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine, when will you be mine, when will you be mine
It's not what you think , but when you take a drink I feel this invitation
There's no need to worry, 'cause I'm in no hurry I just want that sensation
I don't look for trouble, but sometimes that trouble, come looking for me, yeah
There's one thing that I want to do It's take you out of here with me
So, When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine, When will you be mine
When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine
What's the problem I've got to know
When will you be mine
Please don't keep me in suspense this way
When will you be mine
This waiting is killing me
When will you be mine
I can't stand your drinking all night
Galleries of pink galahs
Crystal nights with diamond stars
Apricots preserved in jars
That's my home

Land of oceans in the sun
Purple hazes, river gums
Breaks your heart when rain won't come
It breaks your heart

It takes a harsh and cruel drought
To sort the weaker saplings out
It makes room for stronger trees
Maybe that's what life's about

Winter's come, the hills are brown
Shops are closed, the blinds are down
Everybody's leavin' town
They can't go on

The south wind through verandah gauze
Winds and bangs the homestead doors
A mother curses dusty floors
And feels alone

Trucks and bulk bins filled with rust
Boy leaves home to make a crust
A father's dreams reduced to dust
But he must go on

Tortured redgums unashamed
Sunburnt country wisely named
Chisel ploughed and wire claimed
But never, never, never tamed

Whirlwind swirls a paper high
Same old news of further dry
Of broken clouds just passing by
That's my home

Land of oceans in the sun
Purple hazes, river gums
Breaks your heart when rain won't come
It breaks your heart
All veils and misty
Streets of blue
Almond looks
That chill devine
Some silken moment
Goes on forever
And we're leaving
Broken hearts behind 

Mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
Mystify me

I need perfection
Some twisted selection
That tangles me
To keep me alive
In all that exists
Well, none has your beauty
I see your face
and I will survive

Mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
Mystify me

Eternally wild with the power
To make every moment come alive 
All those stars that shine upon you
Will kiss you every night 

All veils and misty
Streets of blue
Almond looks
That chill devine
Some silken moment
Goes on forever
And we're leaving
Yeah we're leaving broken hearts behind

Mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
Mystify me 

You're eternally wild with the power
To make every moment come alive
All those stars that shine upon you
And they'll kiss you every night 

Mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
Mystify me

Let me tell you of an interview with an Old Man Emu
He's got a beak and feathers and things, but the poor old fella ain't got no wings
"Aren't you jealous of the wedge-tail eagle?" - dom ba da little da da da

(Spoken in tempo) "While the eagle's flying round and round, I keep my two feet firmly on the ground
I can't fly, but I'm telling you, I can run the pants off a kangaroo"

Doo dee ba doo doo doo , boo da da doot doo doo doo
He can't fly, but I'm telling you, he can run the pants off a kangaroo

Well he was the model for the fifty cents - oom ba da little da da da
The designer should have had more sense - oom ba da little da da da
If you take a look, it'll prove to you, I ran the pants off that kangaroo

Doo dee ba doo doo doo...Boo da da doot doo doo..
Take a look it'll prove to you, he can run the pants off the kangaroo

You can't loop the loop like a cockatoo - Oom ba da little da da da
Swoop and toss like an albatross - Oom ba da little da da da
"You silly galah, I'm better by far, than a white cockatoo or a budgerigar;
They squeak and squawk and try to talk, why me and them's like cheese and chalk"
Ba da da Doo dee ba doo doo doo...Boo da da doot doo doo doo
He can't fly but I'm telling you, he can run the pants off a kangaroo...

Well the last time I saw Old Man Emu - Oom ba da little da da da
He was chasing a female he knew - Oom ba da little da da da
As he shot past I heard him say "She can't fly, but I'm telling you
She could run the pants off a kangaroo". -

Ba da da Doo dee ba doo doo doo Doo dee ba doo doo doo...Boo da da doot doo doo doo
She can't fly but I'm telling you, she can run the pants off a kangaroo

Well there is a moral to this ditty - Oom ba da little da da da
Thrush can sing but he ain't pretty - Oom ba da little da da da
Duck can swim, but he can't sing, nor can the eagle on the wing
Emu can't fly, but I'm telling you, he can run the pants off a kangaroo

Well the kookaburra laughed and said "It's true, oom ba da little da da da
Ha Ha Ha Ha Hah Hoo, He can run the pants off a kangaroo"
Oh, yeh! Cajun man, do all he can
Gotta make a livin'; he's a Louisiana man
At birth, Mama 'n' Papa called their little boy Ned;
Raised him on the banks of the river bed
A houseboat tied to a big, tall tree
A home for my mama and my papa and me
The clock strikes three, Papa jumps to his feet;
Already Mama's cookin' Papa somethin' to eat
At half-past, Papa, he's a-ready to go;
He jumps in his bureau headed down the bayou

He's got a fishin' line strung across a Louisiana river
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He sets his traps in the swamps, catches anything he can;
Gotta make a livin'; he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a livin'; he's a Louisiana man
Oh, yeh! Cajun man, do all he can
Gotta make a livin'; he's a Louisiana man
They call Mama Rita and my daddy Jack;
The little baby brother on the floor is Mack
Bryn and Lynn are the family twins
Big brother Ed's on the bayou fishin'
On the river float Papa's great big boat;
That's how my papa goes into town
Takes ev'ry bit of the night and day
To even reach a place where the people stay

I can hardly wait 'til tomorrow comes 'round;
That's the day my Papa takes his furs to town
Papa said, "Son, we got lines to run
We come back again, 'cause there's work to be done."

Oh, yeh! Cajun man, do all he can
Gotta make a livin'; he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a livin'; he's a Louisiana man

I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment which you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
And you know the door to my very soul
You're the light in the deepest darkest night
You're my savior when I fall

And you may not think
That I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
Burning all the photos, sorting through the clothes
You bought this new for me and now it's full of holes
Remember babytalk in the morning
What's the hurry my girl?
You don't need any coffee if you take the day off school

We're all over and I'm all over town
We've got work here tearing it down

You know it's quicker packing for a holiday
'Cause I'd see these things again
I loved you in this T-shirt of mine
You can have it - it says "Life's a Beach"

There's a beach umbrella, couple lying in the sun
And for once in my life it's not the people from the suburbs
It's me's got it wrong

On through the evening and into the dawn
Journey me, journey me
Where love keeps on

Burning all the photos, they have a habit of mocking a single man
I'm keeping the first one, we're not even holding hands

We're all over and I'm all over town
We've got work here tearing it down
There's a beach umbrella, couple lying in the sun
And for once in my life it's not the people from the suburbs
It's me's got it wrong

Are you proud white Australians wherever you are?
Beer in your hand and your elbow on the bar
All you people from Darwin to the south
With your blue faded jeans and a joint in your mouth

Young sophisticates making the scene
At the Lion Hotel in your rolled up jeans
Something going on, we're all employed
Last night another pickininny died

In the dirt filled gutters on the cold concrete
At the nightclub end of Hindley Street
Sit dusky young ladies learning the rules
From drunks and traps and the hard knocks school

Milky brown eyes from drinking all day
Till it's time at the Carrington Cabaret
Down at the port a sick black mum
Rings for a taxi but the taxi won't come

It's probably too painful for us to understand
But two hundred years ago we overran their land
Dreamtime's just a nightmare now, an alcoholic sleep
Australia land of things to do have you got time to weep

Oh our great free land of fire and rain
White man's wealth and black man's pain
You've got to be white if you want to get in
It's the black man's country but the white man's in

Too utter distasteful for civilized man
Hide them away in Arnhem Land
Shake your head and say "That's that"
As you kick away the bottles on Pinky flat

It's probably too painful for us to understand
But two hundred years ago we overran their land
Dreamtime's just a nightmare now, an alcohol sleep
Australia land of things to do have you got time to weep
Julie did three years' trade school
I served my apprenticeship time
We made a modest living, but we were upstaged
Because computers don't strike or need holidays
Our parents ate bread and dripping
Stole wood from the park to keep warm
We're eating by the heater in threadbare jeans
Brown rice and kerosene
Life wasn't meant to be impossible
Spare us the indignity
Two cheers for progress, reason denied
Whitewash and platitudes are all I can find
Our parents ate bread and dripping
Stole wood from the park to keep warm
The cupboard's bare, all we can share's
Brown rice and kerosene
Sometimes I think about cocktails
Update Molotov's recipe
Forget the gravel ballast and stink of benzene
Use rice and kerosene
A major change of scene
Like 1917
With people before machines
I should have known
You'd bid me farewell
There's a lesson to be learned from this
And I learned it very well
Now I know you're not the only starfish in the sea
If I never hear your name again
It's all the same to me
And I think
It's gonna be alright
Yeah
The worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball

You never care
For secrets I confide
For you I'm just an ornament
Something for your pride
Always running, never caring
That's the life you live
Stolen minutes of your time
Were all you had to give
And I think
It's gonna be alright
Yeah
The worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball

The story's in the past
With nothing to recall
I've got my life to live
And I don't need you at all
The rollercoaster ride we took
Is nearly at an end
I bought my ticket with my tears
That's all I'm gonna spend
And I think
It's gonna be alright
Yeah
The worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball

Oh.....
I think
It's gonna be alright
Yeah
The worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball......
City sleeps, taxi sweeps
Avenue of broken dreams
No-one calls the angel falls
Alice is in wonderland

White man dance heat romance
Neon fashion chatter
Alice is in clubland

Wo-oh-oh-oh while limbo
Wo-oh-oh-oh while limbo

She's no Juliet or gigolo
Years may come
Years may go
Alice is in limbo

Alice cried, there's no romance
It's a hopeless dance
Babylon is broken
Alice cried the dream has died
There is no wonderland

When you come across the sea
Me like a beacon, guiding you to safety
The sooner the better now
And when you come
The hills will breathe like a baby
Pulled up, heaving from the bottom of the ocean
The sooner the better now
And when you come to cover me
Fresh with your kisses
Fresh like a daisy chained up in a lion's den
I'll know you by the thunderclap
Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions
And that is why
I stumble to my knees

And why, underneath the Heavens
With the stars burning and exploding
I know why I could never let you down
When you come

When you come like an iceberg float in darkness
Smashing my hull send me to the bottom of the sea
I should know you better now
And when you come, your majesty to entrap me
Prince of light receding
The sooner the better now
And when you come to cover me
With your kisses hard like armour
The sooner the better now
I'll know you by the thunderclap
Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions, hey
And that is why
I stumble to my knees

And why underneath the Heavens
With the stars burning and exploding
I know why I could never let you down

She came out of the water
Into my horizon
Like a cumulo nimbus
Coming in from the distance
Burning and exploding
Burning and exploding
Like a slow volcano
When you come
Cover the ground with ashes, with ashes
Baby, when you come
Nothing changes, now
When you come
Burning and exploding
When you come
When you come

Baby I've got you on my mind, honey you won't ever know
How much I need you by my side, promise you won't ever go
I won't take no from you this time
Baby I've got you on my mind

'Cause honey I've got to show (I won't wait for another day)
Just what I can do (My heart died when you loosed the chains)
Because I think I know (I won't wait for another day)
What you're going through (My heart died when you loosed the chains)
I hope you feel it the way I feel it, I hope you feel it the way I feel it too

So if I had this all my way, honey you won't ever know
I'd be there through every night and day, promise you won't ever go
Iwon't hold back from you this time
Baby I've got you on my mind

I can be loud man, I can be silent
I could be young or I could be old.
I can be a gentleman, I can be violent
I could turn hot or I can be cold
I could be just like the calm before the storm, waiting for all hell yeah to break loose.
I could be innocent or I could be guilty, 
Doesn’t mean that I man believe in the noose. 
I could be rich like a wandering gypsy
I could be poor like a fat wallet lost
I could be first or I could come last
It’s not who breaks the ribbon, it’s how you get across
I could be red, blue, black + white, sunset, darkest at day or brightest at night
I could be the sun man, I could be the moon
I’m made up from the stars man, I’m shining so bright

Da Da dada Da….

I could be asleep man, I can be awake.
I can be alive or be the walking dead.
I can be ignorant or I can be informed
I can lead my life or I could be led.
I can be anything I put my mind to man all I have to do is give myself half a chance.
I could bring love back into my life,
And share it with the World if I got some balance.

I know your name, I told you mine
We've stopped and passed the time of day
You work in town, I work at night
That gives us six until seven to work this out

If I seem a little strange
It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

You are the moon, I am the sea
You pull me in and gaze on down at me
I was alone, I thought I was immune
It's good to know
The door can still be open wide

If I seem a little strange
It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in, ooh yeah

If I seem confused
It's just the state of the heart
I wait in the dark
In the state I'm in, yeah, yeah

If I seem a little strange
It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

If I seem confused
It's just the state of the heart
You know I wait in the dark
In the state I'm in, yeah, yeah

It's the state of the heart
The state of the heart
The state of the heart
The state of the heart

She moves like a mystic
Like a priestess, tall and pale
She lays down the mystery
All her secrets are unveiled

Wherever I look, I see her there
Wherever I go, you know she's there

And she takes posession, she has control
Next to you I can touch the fire
And when the fever takes ahold
Next to you I can touch the fire

Her words fall in echos
Ringing bells like gypsy rhymes
She has the power
No believer can explain

Wherever I look, I see her there
Wherever I go, you know she's there

And she takes posession, she has control
Next to you I can touch the fire
And when the fever takes ahold
Next to you I can touch the fire
I feel the heat pumping in my veins
Next to you I can touch the fire
I see myself going up in flames
Next to you I can touch the fire

Wherever I look I see her there
Wherever I go you know she's there

She takes posession
Touch the fire
Touch the fire
I feel the heat pumping in my veins
Next to you I can touch the fire
I see myself going up in flames
Next to you I can touch the fire
If you want me, come and get me
You don't have a chance if you don't move now
I'm no waiting any longer
You know that I'm playing to win this time

When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win

If you want me, come and say it
Don't wait around for another chance
Make your mind up, make your play
You should be playing to win this time

When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win

All those wasted years, I didn't know I was only emotion away
I got what I wanted from me, but I didn't see it was not what I needed
I was a fool, this time I'm playing to win

If you want me, come and get me
You don't have a chance if you don't move now
I'm no waiting any longer
You know that I'm playing to win this time

When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win
When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win
This time I'm playing to win
This time I'm playing to win
This time I'm playing to win
By John Williamson

Goodbye Bunyip Bluegum, goodbye Blinky Bill
And beautiful little Nutsie, I can't believe it
Our koalas are all dying, can it really be
A national disaster, a world catastrophe

Shiny little black nose and fluffy little ears
Furry little bundle soaking up the tears
Snugglepot and Cuddlepie are crying in the rain
And wombat's gone into his hole and won't come out

Oh pass the hat around between your friends
There's no time to contemplate
Maybe if we show some love
Maybe it's not too late

'Cause Blinky Bill is dying, cross him off the list
Knock on doors, ring the bell, save the eucalypts
I don't think I could stand the shame, knowing that I could
Have saved the world from losing something beautiful and good

One doctor on the job is hardly enough
One little hospital, wake up Australia
It's our corner of the world, time to pull our weight
What would we tell our children about our little mate
Rockin'and Rollin', you're still doing it now
15 years today and you remember how
You're gonna hear it now
Blastin' out your radio
Listen to the music now
Turn Up Your Radio, Ahhhh..... yeah... alright

Stop what you're doing and listen to us

1956 the juke boxes really jumped
The bass guitar and drums they really thumped
Everybodies learning from what they did a long time ago
Listen to the music now
Turn Up Your Radio, Whah.......yeah...alright

One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock
Five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock
Nine ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock rock. We're gonna rock!!!!!!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oh yeah we gotta rock around the clock baby. I'll tell you what I do
Yeah you gotta rock around the clock Danny boy
Come sail your ships around me
And burn your bridges down
We make a little history baby
Every time you come around
Come loose your dogs upon me
And let your hair hang down
You are a little mystery to me
Every time you calling 'round

We talk about it all night long
We define our moral ground
But when I crawl into your arms
Everything comes tumbling down

Come sail your ships around me
And burn your bridges down
We make a little history baby
Every time you come 'round

Your face has fallen sad now
For you know the time is nigh
When I must remove your wings
And you, you must try to fly

Come sail your ships around me
And burn your bridges down
We make a little history baby
Every time you come around
Come loose your dogs upon me
And let your hair hang down
You are a little mystery to me
Every time you calling 'round

Come sail your ships around me
And burn your bridges down
We make a little history baby
Every time you come 'round

I realize the best part of love
is the thinnest slice
and it don't count for much
but I'm not letting go
I believe there's still much to believe in

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I've figured it out what I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin you too long
It started so easy, You'll want to carry on
(carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much
was I'm thinkin loud and I fell out of touch
but I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I've figured it out what I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin you too long
It started so easy, You'll want to carry on
(carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much
cos I'm thinkin aloud and I fell out of touch
but I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin you too long
It started so easy, You'll want to carry on
(carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much
cos I'm thinkin aloud and I fell out of touch
but I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

Now I'm lost
Lost in love
Lost in love
Lost in love
Teary eyes at the window
Where did Mum and Dad go?
I wish someone would hurry up and come and get me
Gee I'm scared
The cat shot through, She saw the light and fled
Cracker night was a real big deal, when I was a little kid
They started lettin' them off after tea I ran inside and hid
And all the dogs from everywhere were underneath me bed

We all went down in our dressing gowns to see the big bonfire
Wide eyes watched the straw man burn on a mile-high pile of tyres
Hot as hell, big black smell and red hot rings of wire

Sky rockets zinging
Catherine wheels spinning
What a flamin' evening
Fire trucks were screaming
Smoky haze hangin' round for days
And Grandma's ears were ringing

Everynight after school draggin' bits of wood
Boxes and branches and rotten old fences
And mattresses were good
We even scrounged a vinyl lounge
And anything we could

Little Guy Fawkes's and letter boxes
Blown all out of shape
Light the wick and back off quick
And make the big escape
Cackin' ourselves and rippin' my shirt
Scrambling through the gate

Sky rockets zinging
Catherine wheels spinning
What a flamin' evening
Fire trucks were screaming
Smoky haze hangin' round for days
And Grandma's ears were ringing

A house burnt down on the edge of town
We all took off with Pa
This thing whizzed across the road
And nearly hit our car
A bang and spark lit up the park
And everyone went Ah! Ah! Ah!

Cracker night was a real big deal
When I was a little kid
It seems like only yesterday
Tucked away in bed
Dreams of schemes and double bunger
Daring things we did
Friday night, it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?

How to tell you, girl
I wanna build my world around you
Tell you that it's true
I wanna make you understand
I'm talking about a lifetime plan

That's the way it began
We were hand-in-hand
Glenn Miller's band
Was better than before
We yelled and screamed for more

And the Porter tune (Night and Day)
Made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
And on the way back home
I promised you'd never be alone

Hurry, don't be late
I can't hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park
And reminiscing

Friday night, it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?

Now as the years roll on
Each time we hear our favorite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing
Spending the hours reminiscing

Hurry, don't be late
I can't hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park
And reminiscing
He gets his hair cut at Marini's
And he drives a Lamborghini
The finest thing that ever walked this earth
His flat is just divine
He buys yoghurt and buys wine
A million dollars is what he's worth

Well he's a village playboy
Toorak cowboy yes he is
Well he's a village playboy
Toorak cowboy yes he is

He dyes all his grey ends
And he's got lottsa gay friends
He is twenty-nine if he's a day
And he wears tinted glasses
And his girls have got tight arses
And if he's camp he wouldn't like to say

He'll be at the supper show on Friday night
Goes once a month just to make it look right
At interval he'll say the movie's a drag
As he gets a cigarette from his leather shoulder bag

Well he bought his first dope outside the South Yarra Arms
A whole matchbox full in his hot little palms
Nineteen Sixty-Eight and the scene was cool
And all of his friends knew that he wasn't a fool

He knows the antique dealers
And all those other stealers
I'll be glad when he goes overseas
My friends he don't do nothin'
He just ain't got no stuffin'
He's just another social disease

Well he's a village playboy
Toorak cowboy yes he is

Riding along my pushbike honey
When I noticed you
Riding down town in a hurry honey
Down South Avenue
You looked so pretty
As you were riding along
You looked so pretty
As you were singing this song

Put on the speed
And I tried catching up
But you were pedaling harder too
Riding along like a hurricane honey
Spinning out of view
You looked so pretty
As you were riding along
You looked so pretty
As you were singing this song
Sing this song

Round round wheels going
Round round round
Down up Pedals going
Down up down
But I got to get across to
The other side of town
Before the sun goes down

Now we're riding along on our bicycle honey
That's a bicycle built for two
I'm looking at my honey in the rear view mirror
Now I got a better view
You looked so pretty
As you were riding along
You looked so pretty
As you were singing this song
Sing this song

Round round wheels going
Round round round
Down up Pedals going
Down up down
But I got to get across to
The other side of town
Before the sun goes down

Grinspoon ' Hard act to follow

(intro)
You're a hard act to follow
Such a fine lookin' fellow
I hear your belly is yellow
You're a hard act to swallow

Kinda makes me sick
The way you turn those tricks
C'mon light it up
I wanna feel the rush

(pre chorus)
I'll be shootin' for thrills when I walk out that door
You say it's hard to care anymore

Kills, thrills and Sunday pills (woah woah)
I'm on a mission to kill, still, coz nothin' thrills (woah woah)

You want your Coke and Hoochie
I want my milk and cookies
You know your eyes look pretty
I think your eyes look pretty

(pre chorus)

Kills, thrills and Sunday pills (woah woah)
I'm on a mission to kill, still, coz nothin' thrills (woah woah)
I can't help missing ya still, will, I always will (yeah)
Thrills, kills and Sunday pills (woah woah)
Alright

(solo)

(pre chorus)
I'll be shootin' for thrills when I walk out that door
Don't turn around and say you need me anymore
Poppin' pieces of pills up off lounge room floor
You say it's hard to care anymore

(1, 2, 3, 4!!!!!!)

Kills, thrills and Sunday pills (woah woah)
I'm on a mission to kill, still, coz nothin' thrills (coz nothin' thrills that are easy to sunday)
I can't help missing ya stilll, will, I always will (can't miss you still, can't miss you still)
Thrills, kills and Sunday pills (woah woah)
Alright
I'm gonna walk myself into town
And ride on back
Guess it means you're quick and I'm clean
My sparkling machine
It's only forty minutes by feet
I'll be back in three
Ride to the hills at night
To watch the lights go down and your neighbours fight
'Cause I'm the boy to keep you up at night

It's a magic carpet and chrome
Can't reach me by phone
A new deck of cards through the wheels
To show you just deep I feel
In the rear view mirror I see
My dust as you're following me

Ride to the corner at night
To watch the lights go down and your parents die
'Cause I'm the boy to keep you up at night
I'm the boy to keep you up at night

To keep you decent seven days a week
'cause it's the second best thing I do with my feet
Watch your ass 'cause I know where you live
And which car you drive

I can look anyone in the eye
Eat my dust as I leave you behind

Follow you to your house
Do you want to kiss at mine?
'Cause I'm the boy to keep you up at night
I'm the boy to keep you up at night
Falling asleep at the wheel again, baby
You're drifting over the line, line, yeah
Your hands are tight but you're losing grip quickly
Fix me, can you read the signs?

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty
And dreaming of the other side
Save your tears and laughter
Because it doesn't matter what you find

It ain't pretty
After the show
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you
With no place to go
If you think you need it
Here's the place to feed it
But it ain't pretty

When everything that you do is wrong
And you feel like you can barely survive, yeah
When those around you are crumbling downwards
Buried in the sunset alive

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty
And screaming like you're back from hell
Save your dreams and occupations
'Cause it doesn't matter what you sell

It ain't pretty
After the show
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you
With no place to go
If you think you want it
Here's the place to get it
But it ain't pretty

The party's over and the road is long
The party's over and you're moving on
The party's over and the road is long

If you think you want it
Then just come out and say it
It ain't pretty

Falling asleep at the wheel again, baby
You're drifting over the line, line, yeah
Your hands are tight but you're losing grip quickly
Fix me, can you read the signs?

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty
And dreamin' like you're outta control
Save your tears and laughter
Because this is the ride
And this is the show

It ain't pretty
After the show
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you
With no place to go
If you think you want it
Just come in and get it
It ain't pretty
If the man must be
Sleepin' at home all the time
And the woman must be
Out workin' all the time...
Yeah, no matter which
No matter which woman he has
And no matter how many
How many men she has
They all gotta go...
Back to home position
They all gotta know
The 99th home position
Do you wanna work?
Do you wanna be sanctified?
Oh do you wanna come round?
Do you wanna be right--do you wanna be right?
Yeah see you in the desert, see you in the town
Here's your precious life
Buried underground
I hear you singin'
Hear you comin' round
Now you are lost--
Do you wanna be found?
Do you wanna be found?
Hear me call...
Hear me call
Do you wanna know...
The 99th home position
Yeah the man must take her
Indoors all the time
And the woman must take him
Outdoors all the time
Yeah no matter which
No matter which man she keeps
And no matter how long
No matter how long he sleeps
They all gotta go...
Back to home position
They gotta know...
The 99th home position
They all gotta know...
The 99th home position

If I could paint
I'd paint a portrait of you
The sunlight in your eyes a masterpiece of truth
And a single tear like a silent prayer
That's shining so much brighter than a diamond ever dared
If I could do anything at all, I'd do it for you

If I could write
I'd write a book for you
A tale of hidden treasures with an I.O.U
And a million words couldn't say a thing
That won't be said in three words
Where love's the central theme
If I could do anything at all, I'd do it for you

Darling can't you see
What you mean to me
Anything that I can do I'll do it for you
And darling don't you know
Just how far I'd go
Anything that I can do, I'd do it for you

Sometimes I feel so second-rate
Seems loving you was my greatest mistake
I know I'm insecure
And love don't keep score
But I wish I could give you more

If I could play
I'd play up a storm for you
A raging sea of passion that you never knew
Every whispered sound would touch your heart
And maybe for a moment I could be your favourite star
If I could do anything at all
If I could, I'd give you more
If I could do anything at all…..I'd do it for you

And darling can't you see
You mean the world to me
Anything that I can do I'll do it for you
And darling don't you know
Just how far I'd go
Anything that I can do I'll do it, I'll do it for you
I'll do it, do it for you

Know what you really need, but you can't get enough
Too many mouths to feed, well ain't life tough
Call this survival, don't pray for a sign

Know what you really want, you can't get it back
Down on the waterfront, now watch out Jack
Nights on the main line and rust on the rail

I see them swindle this town
I've seen them tumble it down
I've seen red rivers, fire and steel
I feel the thunder chained to the wheel

Know what you mean to me, goes deeper than that
Can't fight your destiny, know where it's at
Don't look for lightning or pray for a sign

I see them swindle this town
I've seen them tumble it down
I heard the legend, I watched the skies
I feel the power, the flame in your eyes
I've seen red rivers, fire and steel
I feel the thunder chained to the wheel
Wheel Chained to the

Know what you really need, you can't get enough
Too many mouths to feed, ain't life tough
Call this survival, don't pray for a sign

I see them swindle this town
I've seen them tumble it down
I've seen red rivers, fire and steel
I feel the thunder chained to the wheel
I heard the legend, I watched the skies
I feel the power, the flame in your eyes
I've seen red rivers, fire and steel
I feel the thunder chained to the wheel
Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart

I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears

I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

I (Don't ask me)
I was standing (You know it's true)
You were there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (were shining through)
And they could never tear us apart

You (Don't ask me)
You were standing (You know it's true)
I was there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (were shining through)
And they could never tear us apart

I, I, I
I was standing...(fading) 
you were there...(fade out)

Oh Yeah

I heard about a person who had a broken heart
With nothing to drive him on, no hope no spark no flame
He could'nt see at all tears they were blinding him
He kept it all inside, the guilt and all the pain
You know I say I tried to warn him
They had him backed up against the wall
I hope I'm not too late

No one can tell you exactly what you have gotta be
You've got to stand your ground and fight to save your life
It may be hard but ooh ooh it's the only way
Always remembering there ain't no second prize
There ain't no second prize

You know I say I tried to warn him
They had him backed up against the wall
Why can't I stand up and try to tell him
They've got me backed up against the wall
I hope I'm not too late

No one can tell you exactly what you have gotta be
You've got to stand your ground and fight to save your life
It may be hard but ooh ooh it's the only way
Always remembering there ain't no second prize
There ain't no second prize

Oh no there ain't no second prize
There ain't no second prize

Oh no there ain't no second prize
There's not gonna be no second prize

Oh no there ain't no second prize
Oh there's no second prize

Oh no there ain't no second prize
Never never never never gonna be

Oh no there ain't no second prize
Hey there, Georgy girl
Swingin' down the street so fancy-free
Nobody you meet could ever see
The loneliness there
Inside you

Hey there, Georgy girl
Why do all the boys just pass you by?
Could it be you just don't try
Or is it the clothes you wear?

You're always window-shopping
But never stopping to buy
So, shed those dowdy feathers and fly
A little bit

Hey there, Georgy girl
There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And, oh, what a change there'd be
The world would see
A new Georgy girl

Hey there, Georgy girl
Dreamin' of the someone you could be
Life is a reality
You can't always run away

Don't be so scared of changing
And rearranging yourself
It's time for jumping down from the shelf
A little bit

Hey there, Georgy girl
There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And, oh, what a change there'd be
The world would see
A new Georgy girl

(Hey there, Georgy girl)
Wake up, Georgy girl
(Hey there, Georgy girl)
Come on, Georgy girl
(Hey there, Georgy girl)
Wake up, Georgy girl
(Hey there, Georgy girl)
Come on, Georgy girl
We're so ordinary
Can't seem to break the hold
Of every clown that's come before us
And every story that's yet to be told
And even though the paint's not dry yet
There's someone with their tounge hanging out
'Cause something sour don't taste so bad
When you can muzzle someone needs to shout
And everyone who's watching now
At the movie that's always re run
Can throw a laugh and a stick in the pinks
Who overrated or loud or were young
And anyone who's looking out
Just waiting for tall guys to fall
Can rest assured in blankets now
That nobody can be that small

Bring him round the court house now
We're lying naked and ugly and cold
Don't play around the edges
Play with something that's dusted and old
And when we're lying crying defensless
Be sure that you get in a lay
'Cause something sour don't taste so bad
Now they'll be forgetting you everyday

And everyone who's watching now
At the movie that's always re run
Can throw a laugh and a stick in the pinks
Who overrated or loud or were young
And anyone who's looking out
Just waiting for tall guys to fall
Can rest assured in blankets now
That nobody can be that small

Baby, you were always gonna be the one
You only ever did it just for fun
But you run to paradise
Jenny, I'll meet you at the grocery store
You don't need a friend when you can score
You run to paradise

Johnny
We were always best of friends
Stick together and defend
But you run to paradise
And Mamma, now don't you worry 'bout me anymore
And I see you crying at the door
When I run to paradise

That's right, they had it all worked out
You were young and blonde and you could never do wrong
That's right, they were so surprised
You opened their eyes up
(opened their eyes up)
Opened their eyes up

You don't want anyone
(You don't, you don't, open your eyes up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, your no fool)
Don't tell me, this is paradise
(Open your eyes up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, open your eyes up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, your no fool)
Don't tell me, this is paradise

Good times, why'd I let them slip away
Why'd I let them slip away
Cause I lived in paradise
Run to paradise
Run to paradise
Run to paradise

Jesus say's it's gonna be alright
He's gonna pat my back so I can walk in the light
(That's right !)
You don't mind if I abuse myself
So I can hold my head up
(Hold my head up)
Hold my head up

You don't want anyone
(You don't, hold your head up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, your no fool)
Don't tell me, this is paradise
(Open your eyes up)
You don't need anyone
You don't need anyone (you don't)
You'll tell me, this is paradise

You don't want anyone
(You don't, hold your head up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, your no fool)
You'll tell me, this is paradise
(Open your eyes up)
You don't need anyone
You don't want anyone, (you don't)
You'll tell me, this is paradise
When I was a young man I carried me pack
And I lived the free life of the rover
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback
I waltzed my Matilda all over
Then in 1915 my country said: "Son
It's time to stop rambling, there's work to be done"
So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun
And they sent me away to the war

And the band played Waltzing Matilda
When the ship pulled away from the quay
And amid all the tears, flag waving and cheers
We sailed off for Gallipoli

It's well I remember that terrible day
When our blood stained the sand and the water
And how in that hell they call Suvla Bay
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
Johnny Turk, he was ready, he primed himself well
He rained us with bullets, and he showered us with shell
And in five minutes flat, we were all blown to hell
He nearly blew us back home to Australia

And the band played Waltzing Matilda
When we stopped to bury our slain
Well we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs
Then it started all over again

Oh those that were living just tried to survive
In that mad world of blood, death, and fire
And for ten weary weeks I kept myself alive
While around me the corpses piled higher
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head
And when I awoke in me hospital bed
And saw what it had done, I wished I was dead
I never knew there was worse things than dying

Oh no more I'll go Waltzing Matilda
All around the green bush far and near
For to hump tent and pegs, a man needs both legs
No more waltzing Matilda for me

They collected the wounded, the crippled, the maimed
And they shipped us back home to Australia
The armless, the legless, the blind and the insane
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla
And when the ship pulled into Circular Quay
I looked at the place where me legs used to be
And thank Christ there was no one there waiting for me
To grieve and to mourn and to pity

And the Band played Waltzing Matilda
When they carried us down the gangway
Oh nobody cheered, they just stood there and stared
Then they turned all their faces away

Now every April I sit on my porch
And I watch the parade pass before me
I see my old comrades, how proudly they march
Renewing their dreams of past glories
I see the old men all tired, stiff and worn
Those weary old heroes of a forgotten war
And the young people ask "What are they marching for?"
And I ask myself the same question

And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
And the old men still answer the call
But year after year, their numbers get fewer
Someday, no one will march there at all

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
Who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me?
And their ghosts may be heard as they march by the billabong
So who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me?
Went down to Santa Fe
Where Renoir paints the walls
Described you clearly
But the sky began to fall

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Trams, cars and taxis
Little waxworks on the move
Carry young girls past me
But none of them are you

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Without you near me
I got no place to go
Wait at the bar
Maybe you might show

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

I've got to stop these tears
That's falling from my eye
Go walk out in the rain
So no one sees me cry

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Can't stop the memory
That goes climbing through my brain
I get no answers
So the questions still remains

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Well he's following the broken lines
Living on borrowed time
Motel rooms and broken hearts all left behind
You swear he couldn't close his eyes
As he shifts into overdrive
He's been up and down this road so many times

The man of his own
And searching just keeps him proving
That only the road
Can tame the rebel in his soul

It's the rhythm of the highway
As he rolls on down
And city lights as they fade from sight
Drives the man behind the driving wheels

Like a cowboy in a rodeo
Riding hard but never letting go
You'll be wand'ring through the twilight of his life
Waylon Jennings on the radio
Country music and engines roar
Like a shooting star across a desert sky
And he's got a home
But it's out on the blue horizon
Heaven only knows
There's still a rebel in his soul

It's the rhythm of the highway
As he rolls on down
And city lights as they fade from sight
Drives the man behind the driving wheels

And chasing southern lights
In the distant sky
And open plains with the mountains high
Drives the man behind the driving wheels

Well he's thought about settling down
A little diner on the edge of town
But in this world of push and shove
He's still got freedom in his blood

It's the rhythm of the highway...
Help, I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And the worst part is 
there's no one else to blame

Be my friend
Hold me, 
wrap me up
Unfold me, 
I am small and needy
Warm me up 
and breathe me

Ouch, I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah, I think that I might break
Lost myself again 
and I feel unsafe

Be my friend
Hold me, 
wrap me up
Unfold me, 
I am small and needy
Warm me up 
and breathe me

On the talk back show
On the radio
At the local bar
In the hot traffic by the red tail lights

Everybody's down on their knees
Listen like thieves
But who needs that
When it's all in your hands

And we take it down
To the end of town
Where they have control
But they're losing touch when the lights go out

Everybody's down on their knees
Listen like thieves
But who needs that
But who needs that when it's all in your hands
Everyody's on their knees
Listen like thieves for the [?]
But who needs that when it's all in your hands
It's all in your hands!

You are all you need
You are all you need
And that is everything
So don't hesitate
There's no time to waste
Just do it for yourself

I said everybody's down on their knees
Listen like thieves
But who needs that when it's all in your hands
You got it all
You got it all
It's all in your hands
You got it all
You got it all

[Outro]
I said everybody's down on their knees
Listen like thieves
But who needs that when it's all in your hands
When success is on your mind
But true direction is missing
You know the Gods have lied - but you're still smitten
By the stars in your eyes
I can tell you know where you are
Smile sweetly and you'll be forgiven
You're almost free - almost free to come and go
Bed sitting room for ambitious prisoner
Walk away, don't take no for an answer
Turn a blind eye to it all
Let sleeping dogs lie
Down in Queensway
Like a bulldozer chasing butterflies
Down sad English streets you wander
Over sleeping bodies you step lightly
All the snow on the ground
- lets you pass by without a sound
One last look before you disappear
Walk away, don't take no for an answer
Turn a blind eye to it all
Let sleeping dogs lie
Down in Queensway

When I'm walking down the street I call your name
Inside my head I go insane
Don't you know that it's really making me crazy
There were days when I went completely blind
No time to think and I lost time
Won't believe what's happened to me lately

Cos everyday it's the same day
Different faces with no names
Places I've never been before
And everyday it's the same thing
Different faces with no names
Places I've never been before

And I begin to wonder (don't you know that it's really making me crazy)
And I begin to wonder (won't believe what's happened to me lately)

Cos everyday it's the same day
Different faces with no names
Places I've never been before
And everyday it's the same thing
Different faces with no names
Places I've never been before

And every time I think I'm breaking free
These thoughts return to trouble me
Hanging on to love has left me empty
You're a sinner but you told me you're a saint
Too fast I tripped and lost my way
Can't believe what's happened to me lately

Walking down the street I call your name
(All this time you led me astray)
Making love to you I do the same
(But now I know you blinded me)
And there were days when I went completely blind
(I thought I was over you, really over you)
No time to think, I lost time
(no, I'm not over you)

And I, begin to wonder

Once I smoked a Danneman cigar
Drove a foreign car
Baby that was years ago
I left it all behind
Had a friend, I heard she died
On a needle she was crucified
Baby that was years ago
I left it all behind for my

Cheap wine and a three-day growth
Cheap wine and a three-day growth
Come-on, come-on, come-on

I don't mind takin' charity
From those that I despise
I don't really need your love
Baby you can shout at me
But you can't meet my eyes
I don't really need your love, I got my

Cheap wine and a three-day growth
Cheap wine and a three-day growth
Come-on, come-on, come-on

Sitting on the beach drinkin' rocket fuels Oh Yeah!
Spent the whole night breakin' all the rules Oh Yeah!
Mending every minute of the day before
Watching the ocean, watching the shore
Watching the sunrise, and thinkin' there could never be more
Never be more
Anytime you want to find me
I ain't got a telephone
I'm another world away
But I always feel at home, with my

Cheap wine and a three-day growth . . .

Well there's a band on every corner
But I'm not in one
I hate three out of every four of them
But I haven't got a gun

I was ten hours asleep
But I stayed in my room
I forgot to remember
What I wanted to do

As the glare turns to twilight
My thoughts turn to food
Yeah and of what the hell happened
To the girl in the nude
She gave me a pill
She said it helped her in bed
When I lay down beside her
Couldn't even raise my head

What a fool am I
'Cause my dream was so bright
But I'm drowning in the city
With no saviour in sight

Well this night I'll go walking
Like the truth it's so near
I'll be back I imagine
To the boys and to the beer
There's a whole in my belly
I try and fill it with food
So I order a pizza
And the pizza-maker is rude

Lady in the jacket
Is looking just how I feel
So I sigh in my corner
And I ask for the bill

There's a band on every corner
But I'm not in one
I hate three out of every four of them
But I haven't got a gun

There's a band on every corner
I only play in my room
Where the filth is familiar
And the piano's in tune

How does a man get the love of a woman?
Or a woman of a man?
How does a man tell his feelings to a woman?
You know it's hard to understand

The world seems difficult to me
It's such a shame to see
The loneliness that lays to waste
Both you and me

Where can I find a lover to protect me?
Not run away with my mind
How will I know that she won't reject me?
Somebody give me a sign

The world seems difficult to me
It's such a shame to see
The loneliness that lays to waste
Both you and me

And if I'm lying, lying down
I'm confused
And if I stand here long enough
I just might find myself getting tough
And amused

And if I stand here long enough
I just might find myself getting tough
And amused

How does a man get the love of a woman?
Or a woman of a man?
How does a man tell his feelings to a woman?
You know it's hard to understand

The world seems difficult to me
It's such a shame to see
The loneliness that lays to waste
Both you and me

The world seems difficult to me
It's such a shame to see
The loneliness that lays to waste
Both you and me

The world seems difficult to me
It's such a shame to see
The loneliness that lays to waste
Both you and me

The world seems difficult to me
It's such a shame to see
Loneliness that lays to waste
Both you and me

When I came up from out of the meat locker
The city was gone
The sky was full of lights
The snow provided a silent cover
In moonland
Under the stars
Under the snow
And I followed this car
And I followed that car
Through the sand
Through the snow
I turn on the radio
I listen to the DJ

And it must feel nice
(It must feel nice)
It must feel nice to know
That somebody needs you

And everything moves slow
Under the stars, under the ash, under the sand
And the night drifts in
The snow provied a silent cover
And I'm not your favourite lover
I turn on the radio

And it must feel nice
(It must feel nice)
Oh, very, very nice to know
That somebody needs you

And the chilly winds blow
Under the snow, under the stars
The whispering DJ on the radio
The whispering DJ on the radio
I'm not your favourite lover
I'm not your favourite lover

And it must feel nice
(It must feel nice)
To leave no trace
That somebody needs you
And that somebody is me

Under the stars, under the snow

Your eyes were closed
You were playing with the buttons on your coat
In the back of that car

In moonland 
Under the stars
In moonland
And I followed that car
Little song about a man called Gough
And a little boy who wanted to be tarred with the same brush
He learnt Latin, held his head up high and he hated the
Liberals tho' he didn't know why

There were reasons - how long have you got?
There are always reasons - how long have you got?

The little boy he's on the stage tonight, his name is Anthony Hayes and he's doing alright
They both went to the same local Canberra school, but Stevie was nine in 1972

What a party - a big day for both of us
A big reason to party - a big day for both of us

Come over have dinner with me, we'll play chess and drink claret
Walk slowly down my little street, you can bring Margaret

November 11 was Armistice Day
A bushranger was slaughtered and Gough was betrayed
November 11 - he wouldn't survive the Governor General in '75

November 11 - a big day for all of us
I said November 11 - Ned Kelly died
Shame Fraser shame and we all cried
For you Gough you Gough you Gough
Edward Gough Whitlam
You Gough you Gough you Gough
Edward Gough Whitlam

Days of wine and roses, days of wine and roses
All the artists flew in and all the arseholes flew out in '72
For you Gough you Gough you Gough
Edward Gough Whitlam

All I see - is washed away
I am the voice - left from drinking
I celebrate - my love for you
Into the calm - saying I believe
That all the bitterness will last for hours

Maybe - I would blind the girl
Who is drowning - in the silence
She turns the grey - into a cold stare
Into a storm I have to be
Wake up to anger and mixed emotions

In the sun - I will come - to see Barbados
In the sun - I will come - to see Barba-a-a-dos

In the sun - I will come - to see Barbados
In the sun - I will come - to see Barba-a-a-dos

All I see - is washed away
Ooh, I am the voice - left from drinking
I celebrate - mmm, my love for you
Into the calm - saying I believe
That all the bitterness will last for hours

In the sun - I will come - to see Barbados
In the sun - I will come - to see Barba-a-a-dos
Woh-oh, to see Barbados
In the sun - I will come - to see Barba-a-a-dos
To see Barbados
In the sun - I will come - to see Barba-a-a-dos
To see Barbados
In the sun - I will come

When look for a ride and you need to get high my friend
spend all your time just a walkin around instead
like black rose its somebody to hold for them for them

oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh

When look for a ride and you need to get high my friend
spend all your time just a walkin around instead
like black rose its somebody to hold for them for them

yeah.

Ever since the world began
Men have sailed to foreign lands
And the fortunes that they've found
Are now buried in the ground

Some would say the ocean roars
As it stumbles to the shore
But to me it only sings
Of the sorrow that it brings

All my friends are dead
Or they're dying
Empty laughter turns into crying
It's death-defying

Well, I barely learned to swim
Just enough to save my skin
Now I'll never sail alone
And my harbour is my home

All our friends are dead
Or they're dying
And our laughter only turns into crying
It's death-defying

If there's one thing that I've learned
It's the point of no return
And if that's to be our fate
Now's no time to hesitate

Standin' on a streetlight tryin' to get away
Guilty guilty I hear what you say
Countin' down the hours but I haven't got the time
The 23rd precinct jumpin' on the line on the line

And what I wanna know
Is will I get death row
Or is there a second solution
What I wanna say
Is will I die today
Or will I get...second solution

It was never meant to end this way
One shot violence I hear what you say
Standin' on the streetlight tryin' to get away
Guilty Guilty I hear what I say what I say

And what I wanna know
Is will I get death row
Or is there a second solution
What I wanna say
Is will I die today
Or will I get...second solution

Standin' on a streetlight tryin' to get away (hey)
Guilty guilty I hear what you say
Countin' down the hours but i haven't got the time
The 23rd precinct jumpin' on the line on the line

And what I wanna know
Is will I get death row
Or is there a second solution
What I wanna say
Is will I die today
Or will I get...

Second solution second solution
Second solution second solution
Second solution second solution
Second solution second solution
Second solution second solution
Second solution
I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish, I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love
Be everything that you need
I'll love you more with every breath
Truly, madly, deeply do
I will be strong, I will be faithful
'Cause I'm counting on
A new beginning
A reason for living
A deeper meaning, yeah

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

And when the stars are shining
brightly in the velvet sky,
I'll make a wish send it to heaven
Then make you want to cry
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty
That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of

The highest powers
In lonely hours
The tears devour you

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

Oh can you see it baby?

You don't have to close your eyes
'Cause it's standing right before you
All that you need will surely come

I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish, I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love
Be everything that you need
I'll love you more with every breath
Truly, madly, deeply do

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me
Slow down, you move too fast;
You got to make the morning last;
Just kickin' down the cobblestones
Lookin' for fun, and feelin' groovy
Hello, lamppost, whatcha knowin'?
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain'tcha got no rhymes for me?
Dootin'-doo-doo-doo, feelin' groovy
Ba da da da da da da, feelin' groovy
Got no deeds to do, no promises to keep;
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep;
Let the mornin' time drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you, all is groovy
Slow down, you move too fast;
You got to make the morning last;
Just kickin' down the cobblestones
Lookin' for fun, and feelin' groovy
Ba da da da da da da, feelin' groovy
Escaped from misery
Escaped from war

And now I'm waiting
Now I'm hoping
Now I'm praying
To be accepted

I'm supposed to be free
But I'm locked in a cage

And I'm still waiting
I'm still hoping
I'm still praying
To be accepted

Years of waiting, I have nowhere to go
My whole life depends on their yes or no

Refugees and immigrants also have rights!
They're human beings just like you and me
On Jubilee street there was a girl named Bee
She had a history, but she had no past
When they shut her down the Russians moved in
Now I am too scared, i am too scared, to even walk on past

She used to say:
All those good people down on Jubilee Street
They ought to practice what they preach
And here I come up the hill
I'm pushing my own wheel of love
I got love in my tummy and a tiny little pain
And a ten ton catastrophe on a 60 pound chain
And I'm pushing my wheel of love on Jubilee Streets
I look at them now

The problem was she had a little black book
And my name was written on every page
Well a girl's gotta make ends meet
Even down Jubilee Street
I ought to ?ractice what I preach
These days I go downtown in my tie and tails
I got a foetus on the leash

I am alone now, I am beyond recriminations
Curtains are shut, the furniture is gone
I'm transforming, I'm vibrating, I'm glowing
I'm flying, look at me now
I'm flying, look at me now

There's a noise upstairs in the attic
It's the shuffle of worn out shoes
And the scent of the oil and brushes
Drifts down like a pale perfume

And he says, "i..
I am a man
A simple man
...A man of colours
And I can see
See through the years
Years of a man
...A man of colours"

And the old man rubs his failing eyes
And takes a moment to watch the view
From a window nobody knows is there
He can see the empty street below

He says, "i keep my life in this paintbox
I keep your face in these picture frames
And when I speak to this faded canvas it tells me
I have no need for words anyway..."

And he says, "i..
I am a man
A simple man
...A man of colours
And I can see
See through the tears
Tears of a man
...A man of colours"
Well I've left this place for good
Like you knew I always would
Can't come as no surprise
But when you walk me to the door
Like a thousand times before
You should have seen it in my eyes

I didn't notice my halo was slipping
Someone should have followed me home
My guardian angel went missing
Must have had wings made of stone

They say its one short painless leap
To that final dreamless sleep
In the valley safe from harm
But when the winds blow cold and hard
It could catch you of your guard
You might need more than a lucky charm

See I'd like to be with you tomorrow
Laughing in the cruel sunlight
But I spent all the time I could borrow
High as a kite

You can sift through hours of proof
You could stumble on the truth
But you'll never be satisfied
Cos all the warnings you don't heed
And every useless thing you need
Just feed the fire inside
(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Mushroom Music Publishing Warner)
Did you catch her in the window?
Do I run or do I mend
Praying for heavy comfort
To fill his pockets with his hands
Men in chip shops, milk bars, postmen
Used to fork out for your mouth
And now the compliments have stopped
Since every asset's headed south
He was a sharp one what a looker
The last drunk to hang around
Get well she could colour knickers
Just for the mirror now
Had a dream once it was morning
In a dress that never frayed
And now your friends are like eyelashes
Too many dropping off these days

For forty seconds today
I was sure that we were feeling the same way

For forty seconds today
I was sure that we were feeling the same way
Oh, the nights are long
And I'm so tired of waking up tired
Man, they just drag on and on
And I'm so tired of waking up tired
The company I'm keeping
Won't let me get my sleep in
Oh, I hate the light
And I'm so tired of waking up tired
The morning sun is getting way too bright
And I'm so tired of waking up tired
If I was worth a fortune
I'd never leave my bedroom
I just wanna stay right here, safe and sound
Oh, I have to go
But I'm so tired of waking up tired
The lights are on but there is no-one home
'Cos I'm so wired from waking up tired
I need a month of Sundays
To help me cope with Mondays
I just wanna stay right here, safe and sound
Blankets pulled up to my ears, safe and
Sound
I need a good vacation
From too much recreation
Oh, I'm late again
And I'm so tired, might even get fired
I could blame it on a cancelled train
But I won't try it, I know they won't buy
It
If I was worth a fortune
I'd never leave my bedroom until next June!
I just wanna stay right here, safe and sound
Blankets pulled up to my ears, safe and
Sound
I just wanna stay right here, safe and sound
Why are you in so much hurry
Is it really worth the worry
Look around
Then slow down

What's it like inside the bubble
Does your head ever give you trouble
It's no sin
Trade it in

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man

Are you always in confusion
Surrounded by illusion
Sort it out
You'll make out

Seem to make a good beginning
Someone else ends up winning
Don't seem fair
Don't you care

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man

Don't you forget who'll take care of you
It don't matter what you do
Form a duet, let him sing melody
You'll provide the harmony

Why are you in so much hurry
Is it really worth the worry
Look around
Then slow down

What's it like inside the bubble
Does your head ever give you trouble
It's no sin
Trade it in

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man
The wintergreen, the juniper
The cornflower and the chicory
All the words you said to me
Still vibrating in the air
The elm, the ash and the linden tree
The dark and deep, enchanted sea
The trembling moon and the stars unfurled
There she goes, my beautiful world

There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes again

John Willmot penned his poetry
riddled with the pox
Nabakov wrote on index cards,
at a lectem, in his socks
St. John of the Cross did his best stuff
imprisoned in a box
And JohnnyThunders was half alive
when he wrote Chinese Rocks

Well, me, I'm lying here, with nothing in my ears
Me, I'm lying here, with nothing in my ears
Me, I'm lying here, for what seems years
I'm just lying on my bed with nothing in my head

Send that stuff on down to me
Send that stuff on down to me
Send that stuff on down to me
Send that stuff on down to me

There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes again

Karl Marx squeezed his carbuncles
while writing Das Kapital
And Gaugin, he buggered off, man,
and went all tropical
While Philip Larkin stuck it out
in a library in Hull
And Dylan Thomas died drunk in
St. Vincent's hospital

I will kneel at your feet
I will lie at your door
I will rock you to sleep
I will roll on the floor
And I'll ask for nothing
Nothing in this life
I'll ask for nothing
Give me ever-lasting life

I just want to move the world
I just want to move the world
I just want to move the world
I just want to move

There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes again

So if you got a trumpet, get on your feet,
brother, and blow it
If you've got a field, that don't yield,
well get up and hoe it
I look at you and you look at me and
deep in our hearts know it
That you weren't much of a muse,
but then I weren't much of a poet

I will be your slave
I will peel you grapes
Up on your pedestal
With your ivory and apes
With your book of ideas
With your alchemy
O Come on
Send that stuff on down to me

Send that stuff on down to me
Send that stuff on down to me
Send that stuff on down to me
Send that stuff on down to me
Send it all around the world
Cause here she comes, my beautiful girl

There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes again
The night I met you were a fucking disgrace
Tripping over people falling flat on your face
I thought I'd dance with you cause you wouldn't remember
A year ago now yeah that was the end of December
There's been blood, and there's been biting
There's been Lizzie Taylor Richard Burton fighting
It's all gone bad, that's alright
Cause god I was alive
God I was alive

You found your schoolgirl French somewhere in the haze
And I was gone by the middle of the very first phrase
All's fair in love and war in the Eastern Suburbs I suppose
So I emptied the contents of my pocket in your nose

Well here's been blood, and there's been biting
There's been drunk and disorderly fighting
All down the street and through the night
God I was alive
God I was alive

She don't know which one to buy
Australian Shooter or Australian Bride

I throw my head up into the sky
Thank Dionysius for a little while I was alive

Using up fast the last days of my youth
Trying to see if you were coming from my hot tin roof
And rolling down the highway looking like an evil child
40 hours later you'd be back in the wild

There's been blood, biting, Lizzie and Richard, fighting
It's all gone bad, but that's alright
All down the street, all through the night
And god I was alive

Just when I lose my touch
You come up and touch me
Just when I can't find the words
You run up and tell me
I'm off in the distance, out of time, out of place
You always save a trace for
Friday's child, Friday's child

At times I drift too far from shore
You get the life line to me
When I fight my holy war
You tell me what it's good for
I walk in your footsteps when the road gets too wild
You go the extra mile for
Friday's child, Friday's child

I see it like a silver screen
You see just what you like
When I can't see anything
You make the world turn my way
You make the world turn my way

I walk in your footsteps
The road's hard to find
You stand the test of time
For Friday's child

I smile
You say I take your breathe away
You say you love me and you make
All the right promises to break

And when I turn around you're always there
Like that's the proof you really care
But I see right through you and I think
To myself

You're just so predictable
In every way
I want you to know I know your game
It's so unbelievable
How you never change
You won't get away
With loving me
You're just so predictable

I run
You say you won't give up the chase
You say you'll follow me anyplace
So you can make the same mistakes

You know just what to do
And How to use the best of you
To try and change my mind
But my eyes are opening this time
And I read you

You're just so predictable
In every way
I want you to know I know your game
It's so unbelievable
How you never change
You won't get away
With loving me

Now that I know your every move
How you gonna hide baby what you gonna do
Now that somebody knows the truth
About you and how you're just so

You're just so predictable
In every way
I want you to know I know your game
It's so unbelievable
How you never change
You won't get away
With loving me
You're just so predictable

People dying for no reason at all
Age is no difference or if you're large or small

Families being torn apart
Doesn't have to be this way
Some people, just have no heart
It's happening every day

Pure massacre, pure massacre
Pure massacre, pure massacre

Machine guns pumping, hearts thumping
Death is all around
People crying for freedom
No one hears a sound

Pure massacre, pure massacre
Pure massacre, pure massacre

There's people crying
There's people dying
But someone's taken it all

Machine guns pumping, hearts thumping
Death is all around
People crying for freedom
No one hears a sound

Pure massacre, pure massacre
Pure massacre, pure massacre
Pure massacre, pure massacre
Pure massacre, pure massacre

It's gonna be a pure massacre

Looking for a single thread
Of melody to help me get by
Where we're passing the time
Is it real?
Does it give too much away?
It's pouring out my heart
Till you come back
A reason to stay

Do you know
Is this way home?
Is this way

We just stare while the wheels fall off
But everyone seems to carry on, carry on
No time to tell you
How much we lost
Cause everyone needs to carry on, carry on

Looking for some words to say
There's no familiar faces round here
But the feelings the same
Is it real?
Does it give too much away?
It's pouring out my heart
Till you come back
A reason to stay

Do you know
Is this way home?
Is this way?

We just stare while the wheels fall off
But everyone seems to carry on, carry on
No time to tell you
How much we lost
Cause everyone needs to carry on, carry on

Carry on
Carry on
(Carry on, carry on)
Carry on
(Carry on, carry on)
Everyone needs to carry on, carry on

The places you know
The friends that you owe
Somewhere to go
Does it pay to be alone?
Will i fall?

Is this way home?
Is this way home?
Is this way home?

We just stare while the wheels fall off
But everyone seems to carry on, carry on
No time to tell you
How much we lost
Cause everyone needs to carry on, carry on

Carry on
Carry on
Carry on, carry on
Carry on
Carry on

Everyone needs to carry on, carry on
Carry on

It's the way I feel
Seem's like it's taking me over
You've got your favourite programmes
The bird, the dog, two cats
One of your babies will always
Ring on the weekend for a chat

A beautiful garden
Too easily getting out of hand
How can you concentrate at all?

On the high ground
You're there on your own
From the high ground

And from down here we can feel it
You can move the mountain with your pain
They all want to be near you
And then too soon drive home again
'Cause grief is like that
And you're like a captain on her ship -
In the end you stand alone

On the high ground
You're there on your own
From the high ground
You see the mourners have gone home
On the high ground
You're there on your own

The city is spreading
Soon only numbers will be pure
And you are retreating

And now I walk between tables
Hide in the bathroom for some peace
They want to know what has happened
We can't tell the truth it must be lived
Over and over
'Til it floats up into the sky
To your beautiful baby

On the high ground
You're there on your own
From the high ground
You see the mourners have gone home
On the high ground
You're there on your own

Days of our Lives and Dr Katz
You've got a few friends left
But she's never coming back
She was the one with the questions
And the big blue eyes
On that high ground

You're like Voodoo baby
You just take hold
Put your cards on the table baby
Do I twist, do I fold?

You're like Voodoo honey
All silver and gold
Why don't you tell me my future?
Why don't I sell you my soul

So here it comes, the sound of drums
Here comes the drums, here comes the drums

Baby, baby, baby
You are my Voodoo Child, my Voodoo Child
Don't say maybe, maybe
It's supernatural, I'm coming undone
Baby, baby, baby
You are my Voodoo Child, my Voodoo Child
Don't say maybe, maybe
It's supernatural, I'm coming undone

You're like Voodoo baby
Your kisses are cold
Feel your poison running through me
Let me never grow old

You're like Voodoo honey
My pictures you stole
You play me like a puppet
Sticking pins in a doll!

So here it comes, the sound of drums
Here comes the drums, here comes the drums

Baby, baby, baby
You are my Voodoo Child, my Voodoo Child
Don't say maybe, maybe
It's supernatural, I'm coming undone
Baby, baby, baby
You are my Voodoo Child, my Voodoo Child
Don't say maybe, maybe
It's supernatural, I'm coming undone

[Instrumental Middle 8]

Here comes the drums, here comes the drums

Baby, baby, baby
You are my Voodoo Child, my Voodoo Child
Don't say maybe, maybe
It's supernatural, I'm coming undone
Baby, baby, baby
You just take hold
Don't say maybe, maybe
Do I twist, do I fold?
Macainsh

There's a lotta smartarse songwriters
Who think they're got the answers
I wish they'd all just shut their mouths
And get down with the dancers
All those fancy words and major thirds
Don't mean much to me
And if you want me to listen to that
Don't tell me no philosophy

Oh well there's a lotta smartarse songwriters
Who think they're got it down
I wish they're all just drop their pens
Get up and jump around
All those stolen phrases and latest crazes
Don't cut no ice with me
And if you want me to listen to that
Don't tell me your misery

I don't wanna hear no love songs, seventy-eight piece
Orchestra, girl choirs, fancy session men, multi-track
Harmonies, conga drums, moog synthesizers, electric
Pop-up toasters, Phase 3 GT Falcons with suckpower...

You all know what I want
You all know what I need
You all know what I gotta have
Why don't you gimme some
Why don't you gimme some
Why don't you gimme some

Gimme some of that rock'n'roll melody
Gimme some of that rock'n'roll beat
Gimme some of that rock'n'roll ecstasy
Knock me right off my feet..etc

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
There's a lotta smartarse songwriters
Who think they've got the answers...etc
Listen all of you people
Come and take a few lessons from me
Get yourselves prepared for judgement day
Hallelujah lujah
When you hear the trumpet blast
Then you know you're home at last
Open up them pearly gates for me

Why don't you
Open up them pearly gates
Open up them pearly gates
Open up them pearly gates for me?
Hallelujah lujah!
When you hear the trumpet blast
Then you know you're home at last
Open up them pearly gates for me for me

All you gambling sinners
Now's time to start believing
You're gonna meet your maker some sweet day
Hallelujah lujah!
When you hear the trumpet clear
Gonna say goodbye to fear
Open up them pearly gates for me

Why don't you
Open up them pearly gates
Open up them pearly gates
Open up them pearly gates for me?
Hallelujah lujah!
When you hear the trumpet blast
Then you know you're home at last
Open up them pearly gates for me for me
It's a lesson too late for the learnin'
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, in your hand

Are you goin' away with no word of farewell?
Will there be not a trace left behind?
I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind;
Oh, you know that was the last thing on my mind
You had reasons a-plenty for goin'
This I know, this I know
And the weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go, please don't go

Are you goin' away with no word of farewell?
Will there be not a trace left behind?
I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind;
Oh, you know that was the last thing on my mind

As I lie in my bed in the mornin'
Without you, without you
Every song in my heart dies a-bornin'
Without you, without you

Are you goin' away with no word of farewell?
Will there be not a trace left behind?
I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind;
Oh, you know that was the last thing on my mind

Oh, you know that was the last thing on my mind
Good news for beautiful people
Watching the world go by
Make love in the middle of a warzone
Hey - ya never gonna die

Don't rock the boat - keep your head down
Just another fool in the crowd
Everybody knows - you can be a winner
C'mon - shout it out loud

On the fat of the land I been living
Now it's only a matter of time
Sooner or later - you open your eyes
And return to the scene of the crime

Dig deep at the top of the heap
Now you've bitten off the hand that feeds you
You got nothin' but your soul to sell
You got nothin'

When the river runs dry
You will return to the scene of the crime
When the river runs dry
Salvation will rain on you one last time
When the river runs dry

You got the power I got the money
Another million miles to run
I'd cry - cry for the future
But I wouldn't get anything done
Relax - abandon ship
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Blind luck - destiny - do me a favour

When the river runs dry
You will return to the scene of the crime
When the river runs dry
Salvation will rain on you one more time
When the river runs.. dry

Good news for beautiful people
Watching the world go by
Make love in the middle of a war zone
All of God's children
Never gonna die

You will return to the scene of the crime
When the river runs dry
Salvation will rain on you one more time
When the river runs dry
You will return to the scene of the crime
When the river runs dry
Salvation will rain on you one more time
When the river runs

I'm going home to where the river runs dry

Salvation will rain on you one more time

It's only a matter of time
Only a matter of time
When the river runs dry...
He came in from Melbourne on a Pioneer
Adelaide morning, warm and clear
And a past that wasn't quite within the law

And he opened yet another ten dollar room
To a broken blind and a rising gloom
And a threadbare cotton carpet on the floor

And the muzak piping through the corridor
Played that song he heard before
It went, who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?

A suitcase held with rope and twine
Cleaner's shirt and an open mind
A trail of debts to mark where he had been

A million miles of racetracks
And torn tickets on the ground
And his only son cut down in Phnom Penh green

A police car crawled down Gouger street
As he looked for some place cheap to eat
It was just another curbside interview

With a warrant out in Adelaide
For a bad decision that he once made
An instinct took his tongue and pulled him through

So he left his hotel room that night
In time to make a midnight flight
With an overloaded truckie going east

And the line ran round inside his head
Was it something that his best friend said
"Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?"

A billabong's just a grubby pond that's busy washing ore
The squatter drives a thoroughbred steel
And if he runs forever, will his life be all in vain?
At least that's how it makes him feel

And the truckie pushed a cassette in
As they rumbled through the Grampians
It played Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?

Waltzing Matilda
Waltzing Matilda
Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?

Waltzing Matilda
Waltzing Matilda
Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?

And the truckie pushed a cassette in
As they rumbled through the Grampians
It played Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?

Night Owl
NIGHT OWL
By Little River Band
There is a bar right across the street
He's got a need he just can't beat
Out on the floor he shuffles his feet away
He'll get the girl 'cause he looks so fine
He's gonna win her every time
He knows he will, he's dressed to kill, he's a night owl
(Move on, there's a howl of a night owl calling)
(To belong, she's crying in the night)
(Be strong, find the heart of a night owl falling)
Stay up till dawn, (until the night is gone)
What will become of the restless kind
Where do they go when they've done their time
Wearing their hearts out on the line for all to see
Must be gypsy in their soul
They have a need to rock and roll
They always will, they're out there still they're night owls
(Move on, there's a howl of a night owl calling)
(To belong, she's crying in the night)
(Be strong, find the heart of a night owl falling)
Stay up till dawn, (until the night is gone)
There is a bar right across the street
He's got a need he just can't beat
Out on the floor he shuffles his feet away
He'll get the girl 'cause he looks so fine
He's gonna win (her every time)
(He knows he will, he's out there still, he's a night owl)
(Move on, there's a howl of a night owl calling)
(To belong, she's crying in the night, the night goes on and on)
(Be strong, find the heart of a night owl falling)
Stay up till dawn, until the night is gone
It was back in '32 when times were hard
He had a Colt forty-five and a deck of cards
Stagger Lee 

He wore rat-drawn shoes and an old stetson hat
Had a '28 Ford, had payments on that
Stagger Lee 

His woman threw him out in the ice and snow
And told him, "Never ever come back no more."
Stagger Lee 

So he walked through the rain, and he walked through the mud
Till he came to a place called The Bucket Of Blood
Stagger Lee 

He said "Mr. Motherfucker, you know who I am?"
The barkeeper said, "No, and I don't give a good goddamn."
To Stagger Lee 

He said, "Well, bartender, it's plain to see
I'm that bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee."
Mr. Stagger Lee 

Barkeep said, "Yeah, I've heard your name down the way
And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day."
Mr Stagger Lee 

Well, those were the last words that the barkeep said
'Cause Stag put four holes in his motherfucking head 

Just then in came a broad called Nellie Brown
Was known to make more money than any bitch in town 

She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt
Over to Stagger Lee, she starts to flirt
With Stagger Lee 

She saw the barkeep, said, "O God, he can't be dead!"
Stag said, "Well, just count the holes in the motherfucker's head." 

She said, "You ain't look like you scored in quite a time.
Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime."
Mr. Stagger Lee 

"But there's something I have to say before you begin
You'll have to be gone before my man Billy Dilly comes in,
Mr. Stagger Lee." 

"I'll stay here till Billy comes in, till time comes to pass
And furthermore I'll fuck Billy in his motherfucking ass."
Said Stagger Lee 

"I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know?
And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get one fat boy's asshole,"
Said Stagger Lee 

Just then Billy Dilly rolls in and he says, "You must be
That bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee."
Stagger Lee 

"Yeah, I'm Stagger Lee, and you better get down on your knees
And suck my dick because if you don't, you're gonna be dead,"
Said Stagger Lee 

Billy dropped down and slobbered on his head
And Stag filled him full of lead
Oh yeah
Come and see the real thing
Come and see the real thing

Come and see the real thing
Come and see the real thing
Come and see

There's a meaning there
But the meaning there doesn't really mean a thing
Come and see the real thing
Come and see the real thing
Come and see

I am the real thing

Trying hard to understand that, really not, you're seeing me
Trying hard to understand that, really not, you're seeing me

There's a meaning there

Come and see the real thing
Come and see the real thing
Come and see

I am the real thing

I am not seeing you

Trying hard to understand that, really not, you're seeing me
Trying hard to understand that, really not, you're seeing me

Come and see the real thing

Hey there, all you middle men
Throw away your fancy clothes
And while you're out there sittin' on a fence
So get off your ass and come down here
Cause rock 'n' roll ain't no riddle man
To me it makes good, good sense

Heavy decibels are playing on my guitar
We got vibrations coming up from the floor
We're just listening to the rock that's giving too much noise
Are you deaf, you want to hear some more

We're just talkin' about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die, never gonna die

Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll ain't gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't no pollution
Rock 'n' roll it will survive

I took a look inside your bedroom door
You looked so good lying on your bed
Well, I asked you if you wanted any rhythm and love
You said you want to rock 'n' roll instead

We're just talkin' about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die, never gonna die

Rock 'n' roll is just rock 'n' roll
That was the longest weekend on record
And friday seems like a year ago
There are broken glasses all over the place
And you've gone home

You know that I love you nearly every day
Looks like I'm going to have to
Start my cellar again

You deserve better
Maybe I am the best for you right now

Tuesday is on the phone again
But I got a couple of days o get well
And then we'll start our engines again
Try and ignore where we fell

You deserve better
Maybe I am the best for you right now
Or you could try leave the anchor
Where you left it

Yeah and I want an intervention
But no-one has got the guts
I suppose we can hide a lot from our friends
Me? I just dont come home from lunch
The sky is red and the earth is black
1990 and we haven't looked back
Got it on a jumbo, send it overseas
Got a lot of money now who needs trees?

We've all got jobs now, no more dole
Plenty of money now uranium's sold
I'll ensure supply won't stop
Because I'm Australia's Nuclear Cop

Well I guard the world and its plain to see
I'll look after you after looking after me
Of peace and safety I'll make sure
At least until someone offers me more

We've all got boats, planes and more
Twenty-five fingers that's a bore
I've got no brains but I'm right at the top
'Cause I'm Australia's Nuclear Cop

It's never been better in this land of dreams
Cake and steak and American jeans
Stuart Highway's sealed at last
They can get the ore to the airport fast

Adelaide galleries full of art
Nothing's too dear and for a start
I'll come and inspect your uranium shop
'Cause I'm Australia's Nuclear Cop

Sprinkled the waste around Ayers rock
Given the dingos a bit of a shock
It used to be a black mans sacred site
Now it glows like a neon light

Landscape like a Salvador Dali
We all spend our summers on Bali
I used to be a farmer till my sheep all dropped
Doug Anthony made me a Nuclear Cop

Melt down, turn around, where do you hide?
Can't let your children play outside
Put your Geiger counter near your airtight door
Watch it jiggle and hear it roar

There's so much to celebrate
Living in Australia's uranium state
Parliament House is Leukemia Lodge
And standing at the door is a Nuclear Cop!

If you want to be in my gang
Stand up with me
We'll start a revolution
We'll make the streets free
We'll never weaken
We'll give it our best
Can't be defeated
We're better than the rest

Shoulder to shoulder we're gonna stand
We're gonna fight to the very last man
Can't be defeated don't know the word
Shoulder to shoulder we'll fight the world

We can't be beaten
What do we tell 'em boys
We can't be beaten

There comes a time when every man must fight
What he believes in just isn't right
He'll take so much til he'll take no more
They'll hear us coming when they hear the mighty roar

Shoulder to shoulder we're gonna stand
We're gonna fight to the very last man
Can't be defeated don't know the word
Shoulder to shoulder we'll fight the world

We can't be beaten
Let me hear ya
We can't be beaten
Sing it out loud
We can't be beaten
We'll tell the world
We can't be beaten

Now listen everybody out there
We can't be beaten
You gotta realize you're the real thing
We can't be beaten
We can rule the streets
We can't be beaten
It's just up to you and me
We can't be beaten

Can't be defeated don't know the word
Shoulder to shoulder we'll fight the world
'Cause We can't be beaten
Hey hey
We can't be beaten
You better believe it
We can't be beaten
They'll soon find out
We can't be beaten
Now
We can't be beaten
We can't be beaten
We can't be beaten
We can't be beaten

When moonlight crawls along the street
Chasing away the summer heat
Footsteps outside somewhere below
The world revolves, I let it go
We build our church above this street
We practice love between these sheets
The candy sweetness scent of you
It bathes my skin, I'm stained in you
And all I have to do is hold you
There's a racing within my heart
And I am barely touching you

Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you is
Insatiable
Turn me on
Never stop
Wanna taste every drop
My love for you is
Insatiable

The moonlight plays upon your skin
A kiss that lingers takes me in
I fall asleep inside of you
There are no words
There's only truth
Breathe in, breathe out
There is no sound
We move together up and down
We levitate, our bodies soar
Our feet don't even touch the floor
And nobody knows you like I do
Cause the world, they don't understand
But I grow stronger in your hands

Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you is
Insatiable
Turn me on
Never stop
Wanna taste every drop
My love for you is
Insatiable

Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you is
Insatiable
Turn me on
Never stop
Wanna taste every drop
My love for you is
Insatiable

We never sleep, we're always holdin' hands
Kissin' for hours, talkin', makin' plans
I feel like a better man
Just being in the same room
We never sleep, there's just so much to do
So much to say
Can't close my eyes when I'm with you
Insatiable, the way I'm loving you

Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you is
Insatiable
Turn me on
Never stop
Wanna taste every drop
My love for you is
Insatiable

Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you is
Insatiable
Turn me on
Never stop
Wanna taste every drop
My love for you is
Insatiable

When I look in your eyes
Insatiable
The way I'm Loving you
Oh, what can I do
Insatiable for you

[Intro]
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba

The guy who slagged the football team, those yobs were not for him
He turns into a real estate agent who believes in discipline
The guy who's first to use cocaine, the wild boy breaking free
He'll end up in a court of law as a prosecuting QC
Remember the school captain? Success was a matter of time
I can hear him now as she screams, "Greg, you missed the stop sign!"

Forget Snoop Doggy Dogg, forget old Ice T
The true word out on the streets is produced by the TAC
What's the use of striving? As life's road in front unravels
We get to do the driving, don't choose the direction we travel
Do your homework or wag for weeks, graffiti the Dandenong line
It don't matter much when you hear that scream, "Greg, you missed the stop sign!"

Greg! The stop sign!!
Greg! The stop sign!!
Greg! The stop sign!!
Greg! The stop sign!!

Sometime in the next 10,000 years a comet's gonna wipe out all trace of man
I'm banking on it coming before my end of year exams
The rich kid becomes a junkie, the poor kid an advertiser
What a tragic waste of potential – being a junkie's not so good either
Your folks worked hard for what you've got, you are the fruit of their vine
But who cares what you sow when what you reap is, "Greg, you missed the stop sign!"

Bought a car just the other day, man, could that baby run
But you know what they always say, there's always a better one
Got a tumour in my brain, it's creeping to my lungs
And I've searched around in vain, can't find me a better one

Hardwired into everyone's head is the person they're gonna be
Growing up's not a matter of choice, it's a matter of wait and see
So kids, yeah, you can do it, you can be your best
Girls can do anything, you can pass the test
I'm okay, you're okay, we're okay, we're fine
I thought I heard a semi-trailer, "Greg, you missed the stop sign!"

Greg! The stop sign!!
Greg! The stop sign!!
Greg! The stop sign!!
Greg! The stop sign!!
Greg! The stop sign!!
Greg! The stop sign!!
Greg! The stop sign!!
Greg! The stop siiiiiiggggggn!!

We have the chance to turn the pages over
We can write what we want to write
We gotta make ends meet, before we get much older
We're all someone's daughter
We're all someone's son
How long can we look at each other
Down the barrel of a gun?

You're the voice, try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear
Oh-wo-wo-wo, oh-wo-wo-wo
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear
Oh-wo-wo-wo, oh-wo-wo-wo

This time, we know we all can stand together
With the power to be powerful
Believing we can make it better
We're all someone's daughter
We're all someone's son
How long can we look at each other
Down the barrel of a gun?

You're the voice, try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear
Oh-wo-wo-wo, oh-wo-wo-wo
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear
Oh-wo-wo-wo, oh-wo-wo-wo

ooooh We're all someone's daughter
We're all someone's son
How long can we look at each other
Down the barrel of a gun?

You're the voice, try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear
Oh-wo-wo-wo, oh-wo-wo-wo
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear
Oh-wo-wo-wo, oh-wo-wo-wo (X3)

We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear
We fall into old habits
Talk about giving it up after getting right on
Letter to your mother says you're doing everything you can
And I'm glad that she won't get the joke

You're as free as a ten year old
With a room of your very own
Doesn't matter at all what all those people say at home
With your good humour you're a hero

And you can stop them dragging you down
They've got nothing better to do
Sometimes you've got to laugh in their faces

It doesn't matter if your guitar is in hock
It doesn't matter if you owe us all a lot
'Cause you're getting happier by the minute
And they wouldn't have a clue about what it's like to be lazy
When you've got too much to do
Got too much to do

And you can stop them dragging you down
They've got nothing better to do
Sometimes you've got to laugh in their faces
Laugh in their faces
Laugh in their faces
Come on, laugh in their faces

And you can stop them dragging you down
They've got nothing better to do
Sometimes you've got to laugh in their faces
Laugh in their faces
Laugh in their faces
Come on, laugh in their faces

You can stop them dragging you down
They've got nothing better to do
Laugh in their faces
Laugh in their faces
Laugh in their faces
Come on, laugh in their faces
Laugh in their faces
You gotta laugh in their faces
I wake and the sun has returned
Trees with their majesty back
I walk down to the sea
Yeah, I'll borrow some wax

I can sit out here like a teabag
No more exercise for me
Now I've made it out the back

Breathing in the colors
The blue was resting up for today
While it was kicking back
They were glass-blowing these waves

Its how the gum trees 
Are stamped into the sky
I could be eight years old 
With these colors in my eyes

Waking up in a dream out here
Sun is so low
It's throwing its shimmers at me
Skimming its stones

I can sit out here like a teabag
No more exercise for me
Now I've made it out the back

Back there they're bitching
I'm guilty of it too
Out here if you want a wave
Theres another one coming soon

I'm not surfing
I'm sitting out the back
All the kids are dropping in
On the old man on the plank
The kids are dropping in
On the old man on the plank

Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi

See me ride out of the sunset
On your color TV screen
Out for all that I can get
If you know what I mean
Women to the left of me
And women to the right
Ain't got no gun
Ain't got no knife
Don't you start no fight

'Cause I'm T.N.T. I'm dynamite
T.N.T. and I'll win the fight
T.N.T. I'm a power load
T.N.T. watch me explode

I'm dirty, mean and mighty unclean
I'm a wanted man
Public enemy number one
Understand
So lock up your daughter
Lock up your wife
Lock up your back door
And run for your life
The man is back in town
Don't you mess me 'round

'Cause I'm T.N.T. I'm dynamite
T.N.T. and I'll win the fight
T.N.T. I'm a power load
T.N.T. watch me explode

T.N.T. (oi, oi, oi)
T.N.T. (oi, oi, oi)
T.N.T. (oi, oi, oi)
T.N.T. (oi, oi, oi)
T.N.T. (oi, oi, oi)
I'm dynamite (oi, oi)
T.N.T. (oi, oi, oi)

And I'll win the fight (oi, oi, oi)
T.N.T. (oi, oi, oi)
I'm a power load (oi, oi, oi)
T.N.T.
Watch me explode
She's undercover in the morning
She's a real soul sister at night
Gonna make me reel without warning
Gonna make me feel alright
She's a lion tamer's nightmare
Oh! schoolboys delight!
Send legal men and money
Gonna make me feel oh!

Cos the nigh is just a day away
I'm gonna see you everyday
Any way-o

She's deceptively promisevous
Oh morning, noon and night
On a mission from a mercenary
Gonna make me feel oh!

She's a real pygmalion
Headline we all read about
Figure of my imagination
Gonna make me feel oh!

Hey hey honey when I'm without you
I get a chill up and down my spine
And I, I feel so hot and the pain won't stop
Tearing at this heart of mine
And I wouldn't have it, I know I can say
And I wouldn't have it any other way

Do you like to make love with me or turn it around?
Do you like the way it feels when I hold you tight?
Do you like the way I say I'm coming on home?
I'd get you when I want you then you're on your own

Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
I'm gonna keep my body tight

Looking a little bit closer now
I've got something to say to you
And if your body touches me, I just don't know what I might do
And so hold me honey, hit on the bed
I got notions in my head

Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
I'm gonna keep my body tight

Hey hey honey when I'm without you
I get a chill up and down my spine
And I, I feel so hot and the pain won't stop
Tearing at this heart of mine
And I wouldn't have it, I know I can say
And I wouldn't have it any other way

Do you like to make love with me or turn it around?
Do you like the way it feels when I hold you tight?
Do you like the way I say I'm coming on home?
I'd take you when I want you then you're on your own

Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Souvent pour s'amuser les hommes d'equipage
And it's like talking to a stranger
Remember the panic in its delectable face, when I touched it
It was like talking to a stranger
Venetian candles penetrated its heart
It trembles like talking to a stranger
And Oh Miss Jesus tell me where are your black eyes?
Your baby was talking to a stranger, no no

Souvent pour s'amuser les hommes d'equipage
And it's like talking to a stranger
You tasted mustard when she painted your face
And it was like talking to a stranger
And Oh Miss Jesus tell me where are your black eyes?
Your baby was talking to a stranger
Souvent pour s'amuser les hommes d'equipage
And it's like talking to a stranger

Souvent pour s'amuser les hommes d'equipage
And it's like talking to a stranger
You tasted mustard when she painted your face
And it was like talking to a stranger
Remember the panic in its delectable face, when you touched it
It was like talking to a stranger
And Oh Miss Jesus tell me where are your black eyes?
Your baby was talking to a stranger
You're talking to a stranger
You're talking to a stranger, no no
(Jigga Jigga!)

I was looking to see some dreams drip from your fingers
I was working in that lonely place where memory lingers
If there were words, if there was hair that I could
Drag you back with
If there was one single little hook that I could
Break your back with

(Here we go)
Oh yeah
Better get my head down there
Oh, where?
Down there in that cavern where heaven grows

It's somewhere down there between daytime and the dark
And I'm gonna sweat beneath the light of a warm world
Oh yeah
Better get my head down there
Oh, where?
Down there in that cavern where heaven grows

Out here in the street, naked in front of God and everyone
I'm beginning to see daylight yawning down there
And I'm just sitting here waiting for things to come
Cram that page baby, you know I'm marvellous
You think I'm sweating like this just for fun?

And hey, I know it's true, but I just can't say it
Say it, say it
Hey, I know it's true, but I just can't say it!
Say it, say it
All right, all right!

Just one touch
And everything will be all right

Once In A Lifetime
(John Shanks, Keith Urban)
I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in your touch
I know that you’re scared
But you’ve never been this loved

It’s a long shot baby
Yeah I know it’s true
But if anyone can make it
I’m bettin’ on me and you

Just keep on movin’ into me
I know you’re gonna see
The best is yet to come

Don’t fear it now we’re goin’ all the way
That sun is shinin’ on a brand new day
It’s a long way down and it’s a leap of faith
But I’m never givin’ up ‘cause I know we got a
Once in a lifetime love

Everybody’s lookin’ for what we’ve found
Some wait their whole life and it never comes around

So don’t hold back now just let go
Of all you’ve ever known
You can put your hand in mine

I close my eyes and I see you standin’ right there
Sayin’ “I do” and they’re throwin’ the rice in our hair
Well the first one’s born then her brother comes along
And he’s got your smile
I’ll be lookin’ back on the life we had
Still by your side

So don’t fear it now we’re goin’ all the way
That sun is shinin’ on a brand new day
It’s a long way down and it’s a leap of faith
But I’m never givin’ up
Don’t fear it now I’ll never let you go
When you’re by my side I know I’ve made it home

It’s a long way down and it’s a leap of faith
But I’m never givin’ up ‘cause I know we got a
Once in a lifetime love
Lifetime love
It’s a lifetime love
A letter to you on a cassette
'Cause we don't write anymore
Gotta make it up quickly
There's people asleep on the second floor
There's no aphrodisiac like loneliness
Truth beauty and a picture of you 

You'll be walking your dog in a few hours
I'll be asleep in my brother's house
You're a thousand miles away
With food between your teeth
Come up for summer I've got a place near the beach
There's room for your dog 

There's no aphrodisiac like loneliness
Truth beauty and a picture of you 

There's no aphrodisiac like loneliness
Youth truth beauty fame boredom and a bottle of pills 

There's no aphrodisiac like loneliness
You shouldn't leave me alone 

There's no aphrodisiac like loneliness
Bare feet like a tom-boy and a crooked smile 

Truth youth beauty fame boredom red hair no hair innocence
Saturday and a picture of you
A letter to you on a cassette
You shouldn't leave me alone 

Forty shaved sexy wants to do it all day
With a gun-totin' trigger-happy tranny named Kinky RenÃ©e
Tired teacher twenty-eight seeks regular meetings for masculine muscular nappy-clad brutal breeding 
While his wife rough-wrestles with a puppy all aquiver
on a wine-soaked strobe-lit Asiatic hall of mirrors and a dash of loneliness
There's no aphrodisiac quite like it
Truth youth beauty fame boredom red hair no hair innocence impunity and a picture of you
I got a video set-up me love you short time she pay me suck his finger with some fine wine

Walk with me through the long and lonely night
Walk with me and my world is filled with light
Here I stand feeling lost and so alone
Take my hand don't desert me now
Please don't hurt me now
If you walk with me though' I know the road is long
I'll get by with your love to make me strong
More by far than a guiding star above
I long for you
Walk with me oh my love

Somewhere the sunbirds fly
In a clear blue sky
Only you and I there together
Love me now and for ever

Walk with me through the long and lonely night
Walk with me and my world is filled with light
Here I stand feeling lost and so alone
Take my hand don't desert me now
Please don't hurt me now
If you walk with me though' I know the road is long
I'll get by with your love to make me strong
More by far than a guiding star above
I long for you
Walk with me oh my love
I long for you
Walk with me oh my love

Somewhere the sunbirds fly
In a clear blue sky
Only you and I there together
Love me now and for ever
Do you believe in Heaven above?
Do you believe in love?
Don't tell a lie, don't be false or untrue
It all comes back to you

Open fire!
On my burning heart
I've never been lucky in love
My defenses are down
A kiss or a frown
I can't survive on my own

If a girl walks in and draws her name in my heart
I'll turn and run away
Every day, we've all been led astray
It's hard to be lucky in love

It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
You're looking for love
Calling Heaven above

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now

Empty dreams can only disappoint
In a room behind your smile
But don't give up, don't give up
(Give up, give up, give up)
You can be lucky in love

It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
You're looking for love
Calling Heaven above

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now

Right now

What am I gonna do - what about the future?
Gotta draw the line without delay
Why shouldn't I get emotional - the bush is sacred
Ancient life will fade away

Over the hill they go, killing another mountain
Gotta fill the quota - can't go slow
Huge machinery wiping out the scenery
One big swipe like a shearer's blow

Rip rip woodchip - turn it into paper
Throw it in the bin, no news today
Nightmare, dreaming - can't you hear the screaming?
Chainsaw, eyesore - more decay

Remember the axemen knew their timber
Cared about the way they brought it down
Crosscut, blackbutt, tallowood and cedar
Build another bungalow - pioneer town

I am the bush and I am koala
We are one - go hand in hand
I am the bush like Banjo and Henry
It's in my blood - gonna make a stand

Rip rip woodchip - turn it into paper
Throw it in the bin, no news today
Nightmare, dreaming - can't you hear the screaming?
Chainsaw, eyesore - more decay

Rip rip woodchip - turn it into paper
Throw it in the bin - don't understand
Nightmare, dreaming - can't you hear the screaming?
Stirs my blood - gonna make a stand

(There comes a time in a young girl's life
When she first meets a man
There comes a time in a young girl's life
When she becomes a woman)

Highway number nineteen
The moon's shining bright
She's been in my dreams
If it's ever gonna happen
It'll happen tonight

Talk to me, talk to me
Tell me what you gonna do
Come to me, come to me
Are we gonna see it through?
So you got a reputation
Well I do too!
All across the nation
There are guys hanging out to meet girls like you

And the dogs are talking
The dogs are talking
The dogs are talking

Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
With a jelly roll skin
Lovemaker, lovemaker
Ain't'cha gonna let me in?
B-b-b-backseat, backseat
You know ya gotta loosen up
Body heat, body heat
Don't stop now
Don't stop, don't stop

The dogs are talking
The dogs are talking
The dogs are talking
Let 'em talk
The dogs are talking
The dogs are talking
The dogs are talking...ow

(Solo)

Cool down, cool down
You don't wanna go home
Turn around, turn around
We're gonna scream and moan
Talk to me, talk to me
What's you number?
What's your name?
Gimme more, gimme more
Gotta do it again, and again, and again

The dogs are talking
The dogs are talking
The dogs are talking
Let 'em talk, talk
The dogs are talking
The dogs are talking
The dogs are talking
Talk, talk
Talk, talk
Talk, talk
The dogs are talking
Talk, talk, talk
Makin' the scene
I really mean
You should be there with me
And make believe
I'll find a place for us
To be alone
Here in the depths of our emotion
Don't you know, baby

Get set (get set) everybody
We're on our way (we're on our way')
To meet you
Too late (too late) everybody
We're on our way (we're on our way)
To nowhere (to nowhere I will be)
And I will be there

Kick out your seat
Let's elevate
Hold on to what you know
Is gonna break
A roller coaster ride
Inside your mind
Is what you need to terrify you
Don't you know, baby

Get set (get set) everybody
We're on our way (we're on our way')
To meet you
Too late (too late) everybody
We're on our way (we're on our way)
To nowhere (to nowhere I will be)
And I will be there

Never gets you too far
(Never gets you too far)
Never gets you too far now
And if you climb aboard there is nothing to it
If you concentrate we will see you through it
Don't forget at the end of the ride
You'll be hypnotized by the sound it's too late

Get set (get set) everybody
We're on our way (we're on our way')
To meet you
Too late (too late) everybody
We're on our way (we're on our way)
To nowhere (to nowhere I will be)
I will be there

If you want me to
(If you want me to)
If you want me to

Campbell lane
Through the window, curtain rain
Long night gone, yellow day
Speed shivers melt away

Six o'clock I'm goin' down
Coffee's hot and the toast is brown
Hey streetsweeper, clear my way
Sweethearts breakfast is the best in town
Oh-oh, Breakfast at Sweethearts . . 

Hey, Anne-Maria
It's always good to see her
She don't smile or flirt
She just wears that mini-skirt
Drunks come in
Paper bag, Brandivino
Dreams fly away
As she pulls another cappucino

Six o'clock I'm goin' down
Coffee's hot and the toast is brown
Hey streetsweeper, clear my way
Sweethearts breakfast is the best in town
Oh-oh, Breakfast at Sweethearts . .
You think it's going all right
You think it's going fine, girl
You think there's nothing in it for you
I hope you don't
I hope you don't mind
Gonna get you come around baby
Wanna see you through it
Not makin' any promises maybe
That's only in the movies, movies

Things justa
Don't seema
To be going right

Prospect of reconciliation
Memories of some funny conversation
Feel like taking a vacation
Like going to the moon
I can't afford it
Your mother with a bird's nest hairdo
Your brother with plenty of action
Your father always thinking me a weirdo
I can't get no satisfaction

You think it's going all right
You think it's going fine, girl
You think there's nothing in it for you
I hope you don't mind
Your mother with a bird's nest hairdo
Your brother with plenty of action
Feel like taking a vacation
Like going to the moon
I can't afford it

Things justa
Don't seema
To be going right
Everybody's wearin' blue jeans
Everybody's got their own scenes
Everybody's lost in daydreams
But everybody's wearin' blue jeans

Everybody's wearin' blue jeans
Everybody's got their own schemes
Everybody cheers their own teams
But everybody's wearin blue jeans

We're all reading the same books
We're all getting the same looks
Everybody's got their own views
But we're all reading the same news

Everybody's wearin' blue jeans
Everybody's got their own scenes
Everybody's lost in daydreams
But everybody's wearin' blue jeans

I'm singin' in my own band
I'm tryin' to play the right hand
I'm livin' by my own means
And I'm wearing my blue jeans

Everybody's wearin' blue jeans
Everybody's got their own scenes
Everybody's lost in daydreams
But everybody's wearin' blue jeans
Yonder she’s walking
She comes my way
Red dress on
Her long black hair
Talkin’ like
Walkin’ like
Walkin’ like
She comes to me

Oh baby I love you so
I need you now
I want you back
I can’t go on...

Helpless baby
Evil child
I’ve known you well and if you wanna stay that’s alright
You want me again
And then and you come to me
Well, that’s, that’s alright! That’s alright! That’s alright!

Now she’s gone
She’s walkin’ away
Red dress on
Her long black hair
I love her so
But now she’ll come runnin’
Anytime I say
Well that’s alright

Oh baby I love you so
I want you back
I need you now
I can’t go on...

Oh baby I want you back
I need you now
I love you so
I can’t go on...
Well, I was lookin' out the window
There's nothing there to see
I needed inspiration
So I turned on the TV
Is there anybody in there?

Well, Reagan finally cracked
And the Yankees went to war
We peeled away the bandages
And looked into the sore
Is there anybody in there?
Is there anybody in there?
Is there anybody in there?

Yeh, well...

Well everyone was watching
As we counted out the dead
All these people bleeding
In someone else's head
Is there anybody in there?
Is there anybody in there?
Is there anybody in there?

Don't leave it uncovered
Better cover it over
Don't leave it uncovered
Better cover it over
Don't leave it uncovered
Cover it over

I got the box between my hands
I shook it all around
I got Judgment Day on long form
But there wasn't any sound
Is there anybody in there?

So I bolted out the backgate
I can't watch TV no more
What with all these dyin' children
Screamin' at my door
Is there anybody in there?
Is there anybody in there?
Is there anybody in there?

Yeh, is there anybody in there?

Did you ever ask yourself?
Did you ever wonder why?
Why you quake and tremble
When you look up at the sky?

Don't leave it uncovered
Better cover it over
Don't leave it uncovered
Better cover it over
Don't leave it uncovered
Cover it over
Yeeeaah

I see you everywhere I go
Can't bring myself to say hello hello
I'm speakin up like you're new here
I know you want to 'cause you've made it clear
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go
You're there
Is it a coincidence
That everywhere I go
You're there
Could it be you really care
I got your eye in my direction
You seem to smile and then walk away
I know we're running the same line
You know it's only a matter of time
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go
You're there
Is it a coincidence
That everywhere I go
You're there
Could it be you really care
Playing this game of cat and mouse
Is so exciting
But isn't it about time
That we cooled the fire
Playing this game of cat and mouse
Is so exciting
But isn't it about time
That we cooled the fire
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go
You're there
Is it a coincidence
That everywhere I go
You're there
Could it be you really care
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go
You're there
Is it a coincidence
That everywhere I go
You're there
Could it be you really care
Yeah Babe
Everywhere I go you're there
You're there
You're there
Oh, Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountainside;
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling
It's you, it's you must go, and I must bide

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow;
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow;
Oh, Danny Boy, oh, Danny Boy, I love you so
But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I well may be
Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me
Can you guess where I'm calling from?
The Las Vegas Hilton
I know it's hard to hear
It's just the echo on the line
Yes, that's right I'm calling from
The Las Vegas Hilton
I just wanna say that I'm feeling fine

I'll be home on a Monday
Somewhere around noon
Please don't be angry
I'll be back with you real soon

I was hoping to catch a glimpse
Of the man from Memphis
They told me that he had gone
Never leaving a trace
I just could never get involved
With those one armed bandits
Sure am craving for the smile on your face

I'll be home on a Monday
Somewhere around noon
Please don't be angry
I'll be back with you real soon

You looked so lovely
When I left I nearly didn't go
Twelve thousand miles is
Such a long way
Help me get to grips with

Hollywood - you're getting through to me
Hollywood - you're in my movie

[Guitar Instrumental]

I'll be home on a Monday
Somewhere around noon
Please don't be angry
I'll be back with you real soon, oh

I'll be home on a Monday
Somewhere around noon
Please don't be angry
I'll be back with you real soon

Can you guess where I'm calling from?
Yes that's right I'm calling from
The Las Vegas Hilton

The fix is in, we should have known
It was always there from the start
Deep within, so slow and strong
Working its way to the heart
One day you notice a change
And then nothing's the same
I'll be your lover now, baby don't deny it
I'll be your lover now, money couldn't buy this
You crossed your mouth to keep mine shut
My timing was never that good
But I couldn't stand to see you mixed up
With a faker who kept his cards hid
I stayed in the game 'til the end
Waiting for my big hand
I'll be your lover now, money couldn't buy this
I'll be your lover now, baby don't deny it
'Cause I know your deep dirty places of pain
You know your secrets will always be safe
I'll keep them with mine, we're two of a kind
I'll be your lover now
The penny drops, the bottle spins
The stars all shift, the tables turn
The arrow strikes, the die is cast
The high shall be low and the first shall be last
I stayed in the game 'til the end
Waiting for my big hand
I'll be your lover now
You know your secrets will always be safe
Because there's nothing more precious than shame
I'll keep yours with mine
We're two of a kind
I'll be your lover now

It's because I love you
Not because were far apart
It's because I love you
And because your near my heart

It's because I miss you
Oh how long it seems to be
It's because I miss you
Thoughts of you come back to me

Once we walked together
From the fields up to the door
Promised love forever
I remember that day still
It's because I love you
I'll come home to you one day
It's because I love you
In my thoughts you'll always stay

Oh, Do what you want to do, be what you want to be yeah
We can lock away the bad memories together
Close the doors to the past forever
Watching you touch
We're past this much

Oh it's-a lonesome away from your kindred and all
By the campfire at night we'll hear the wild dingoes call
But there's-a nothing so lonesome, morbid or drear
Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer

Now the publican's anxious for the quota to come
And there's a far away look on the face of the bum
The maid's gone all cranky and the cook's acting queer
Oh what a terrible place is a pub with no beer

Then the stockman rides up with his dry dusty throat
He breasts up to the bar and pulls a wad from his coat
But the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer
As the barman says sadly the pub's got no beer

Then the swaggie comes in smothered in dust and flies
He throws down his roll and rubs the sweat from his eyes
But when he is told, he says what's this I hear
I've trudged fifty flamin' miles to a pub with no beer

Now there's a dog on the v'randa, for his master he waits
But the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates
He hurries for cover and he cringes in fear
It's no place for a dog 'round a pub with no beer

And old Billy the blacksmith, the first time in his life
Why he's gone home cold sober to his darling wife
He walks in the kitchen, she says you're early Bill dear
But then he breaks down and tells her the pub's got no beer

Oh it's hard to believe that there's customers still
But the money's still tinkling in the old ancient till
The wine buffs are happy and I know they're sincere
When they say they don't care if the pub's got no beer

So it's-a lonesome away from your kindred and all
By the campfire at night we'll hear the wild dingoes call
But there's-a nothing so lonesome, morbid or drear-a

Went down to Santa Fe
Where Renoir paints the walls
Described you clearly
But the sky began to fall

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Trams, cars and taxis
Little waxworks on the move
Carry young girls past me
But none of them are you

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Without you near me
I got no place to go
Wait at the bar
Maybe you might show

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

I've got to stop these tears
That's falling from my eye
Go walk out in the rain
So no one sees me cry

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Can't stop the memory
That goes climbing through my brain
I get no answers
So the questions still remains

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

(Spinning around, spinning around)
(Oh)

I'm spinning around
Move outta my way
I know you're feeling me
'Cos you like it like this
I'm breaking it down
I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me
'Cos you like it like this

Traded in some sorrow
For some joy that I borrowed
From back in the day
Threw away my old clothes
Got myself a better wardrobe
I got something to say
I'm through with the past
Ain't no point in looking back
The future will be
And did I forget to mention
That I found a new direction
And it leads back to me, yeah

I'm spinning around
Move outta my way
I know you're feeling me
'Cos you like it like this
I'm breaking it down
I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me
'Cos you like it like this
The mistakes I've made

Have given me the strength
To really believe
That no matter how I take it
There's no way I'm gonna fake it
'Cos it's gotta be real
I've got nothing left to hide
No reason left to fight
'Cos the truth's given me
A new freedom inside
Getting rid of my desire
Do you like what you see

Baby, baby, baby, ooh
(Ooh) You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby

Feeling me 'cos you like it like this
Oh, I'm not the same
I know you like it like this, oh, ooh, yeah
Like it like this
Like it like this
(I'm not the same)
Like it like this
I'm not the same (I'm not the same)
Oh

Thinking about you oh so much,
Im losing peace of mind
Scared there'd be a treasure lost all of the time
Whispering voices deep inside,
Crying to be heard
Telling me to take the risk of love until it hurts
And baby

You'll never know
Know which choice to make
Take or break a hold
Which way to go
Say what you will
What your willing to give
Give or take control
Will we ever know

Standing on a corner
Like a victim of a crime
You nearly passed me by
Then you said you'd had your share of lies
And make believe
Now all you want from me is some kind of guarantee

You'll never know for sure
You spend all your life keeping score
Still never know

As the evening sun comes, sinking down
I see another Golden Age dying
And outside in the city streets
A Christian soul is singing words of warning
So many things been going down
Jesus Christ sometimes I feel like I'm immobilised
'Cause we're living in this stormy world
And the ties of love seem to be unwinding

When there's nothin' to hold on to
And there's no one there to comfort you

If you believe
There's better times ahead
There's better days (yeah, yeah)

Now cryin' it don't count for much
When you're crippled in your soul
You gotta take the hope from deep within
To be lifted up and turned around (yeah, yeah)
And all the people will
All the people will hear the callin'
'Cause we're livin' in this stormy world
And the ties of love seem to be unwinding

Just be guided by the things you are
Don't hold back, don't hold back

If you believe
There's better times ahead
There's better days (yeah, yeah)

I look up and the stars don't shine
And down here another Golden Age is dyin'
And outside in the city streets
A Christian soul is singing words of warning
So many things been going down
Jesus Christ sometimes I feel like I am immobilised
'Cause we're living in this stormy world
And the ties of love seem to be unwinding

When there's nothin' to hold on to
And there's no one there to comfort you

(J. Camilleri L. Polec – Mushroom Music Publishing Orient Pacific)
Lookin' through the rain to see where the love has gone
But it will shower us again
I wish there was somethin' I could have done
To keep the love I had for you
Fifteen is lookin' for some answers she says, she'll risk it all to find the truth
But in the long run she's got nothin' to lose, only her dreams can come true
So I send her on her way she hesitates, not too sure it's the right thing to do
She wants to compare me to the others, but our love won't carry through
Fifteens' looking for somethin' she's not too sure maybe it's what she left behind
She just turns her back on the past, spreads her wings she's free at last
Fifteen is lookin' for some answers she says, she'll risk it all to find the truth
But in the long run she's got nothin' to lose, only her dreams can come true
Free at Last
I may be a rich man's daughter
And have servants of my own
I can snap my fingers
And I could have anything I want

Sometimes I look out my window
See lover's hand in hand walk by
They see the diamonds I wear
But not the tears of envy in my eye

Oh when will the good apples fall on my side of the fence
When will I taste the sweet fruits of life
When will the sun smile for me through great cloudy skies above
When will I find my true true love

Well my daddy says
Don't worry
And my daddy says
Just wait
I'm going to find you a rich man's son
And bring him to our gate

Sometimes I look out my window
See lovers hand in hand walk by
Daddy doesn't know it
There are some things that money just can't buy

Oh when will the good apples fall on my side of the fence
When will I taste the sweet fruits of life
When will the sun smile for me through great cloudy skies above
When will I find my true true love

When will I find my true true love
When will I find my true true love
When will I find my true true love
When will I find my true true love
He'll come in and sit by me
In the grainy light of four o'clock
He sits on his hands a lot
He's kind of nervous

I don't think he's got much money
But he's got the time of day

'Cause God drinks down at the Sandringham these days
Since the Shakespeare changed its name
He drinks down at the Sandringham these days
He's what we call alright around here

Talks a bit, he likes to sit
Watches people come in and smiles
Somehow we're part of him
We nod and chat a while

He drinks slowly like it's holy
From a glass that always looks half full

Well, there's a little boy waiting
At the counter of the corner shop
He's been waiting down there, waiting half the day
They never ever see him from the top
He gets pushed around, knocked to the ground
He gets to his feet and he says...

What about me? It isn't fair
I don't have enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

Well, there's a pretty girl serving
At the counter of the corner shop
She's been waiting back there, waiting for a dream
Her dreams walk in and out; they never stop
Well she's not too proud, to cry out loud
She runs to the street and she screams...

What about me? It isn't fair
I don't have enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

More than you give...

Take a step back and see the little people
They might be young
But they're the ones that make the big people big
So listen as they whisper:
"What about me?"

And now I'm standing on the corner
All the world's gone home
Nobody's changed, nobody's been saved
And I'm feeling cold and alone
I guess I'm lucky, I smile a lot
But sometimes I wish for more, than I've got...

What about me? It isn't fair
I don't have enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more...

What about me? It isn't fair
I don't have enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more, you just take more
You just take more than you give

What about me?
What about me?
What about...me?

When I get home I found you sleeping
I said the words you know are true
And I'm stone
Stone cold in love with you

You don't have to turn the light on
Ain't had more than just a few
And I'm stone
I'm stone cold in love with you

You don't have to wonder why now
Look at all the things you've been to me
I'll build my whole life on the sweet foundation
You've given, baby you know what I mean

I left my friends back in the poolroom
They'll still be drowning out the blues
I'm stone
I'm stone cold in love with you

You don't have to wonder why
Look at all the things you've been
My heart lies on the sweet foundation
You've given, baby you know what I mean

I see your face below the window
I see the moonlight coming through
And I'm stone
I'm stone cold in love with you
Yes I'm stone
I'm stone cold in love with you
It's been some months and here she is again
In the room where we did it all
Careless reminders of another girl staying here
Are hard to ignore

She don't feel jealous no, she just feels strange
Time is doing well by us

Beautiful when love fades slowly
And we talk with the ease of old
Later on, cooling down slow
Nothing between us solved

Our love is fading, but how could you tell?
It's killing the pain, sparing the love
It's doing well by us

Time
Time
Time is doing well by us

It's been some months since she came around
Lying where she used to lie
She's so beautiful I could eat her
Been some months, making me love too slow
Making me love so, so long

Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn
I push it down, push it down

I'm the one "for a good time call"
Phone's blowin' up, they're ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love

1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 drink
1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 drink

Throw them back, till I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier

And I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight

She can't take her eyes off the clock
She's meeting him down by the dock
The sweet scent of lavender
Hand-picked rose
A cold wind blows

The streets are still quiet and bare
She ties one last bow in her hair
If everything changes
Then nothing's the same

Do you remember now you can recall
Fields in December the sea rise and fall
We all rise and fall

They ring out the fortunes of war
Then bury their dead back on shore
The spoils of victory
Heart and steel
A time to heal

Can you imagine those long lonely years
Smoke from the factories, children in tears
Do you remember now can you recall
Fields in December the seas rise and fall
We all rise and fall

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)
Pick apart
The pieces of your heart
And let me peer inside
Let me in
Where only your thoughts have been
Let me occupy your mind
As you do mine

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense
But I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

You have lost
Too much love
To fear, doubt and distrust
(It's not enough)
You just threw away the key
To your heart

You don't get burned
('Cause nothing gets through)
It makes it easier
(Easier on you)
But that much more difficult for me
To make you see...

Love ain't fair
So there you are
My love

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense
But I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

Love ain't safe
You won't get hurt if you stay chaste
So you can wait
But I don't wanna waste my love

I'm gonna have a good time tonight
Rock and roll music gonna play all night
Come on, baby, it won't take long
Only take a minute just to sing my song
I'm gonna have a good time tonight
Rock and roll music gonna play all night
Come on, baby, it won't take long
Only take a minute just to sing my song

Listen, waaaah

I'm gonna have a good time tonight
Rock and roll music gonna play all night
Come on, baby, it won't take long
Only take a minute just to sing my song
I'm gonna have a good time tonight
Rock and roll music gonna play all night
Come on, baby, it won't take long
Only take a minute just to sing my song
I'm gonna have a good time tonight
Rock and roll music gonna play all night
Come on, baby, it won't take long
Only take a minute just to sing my song...
I've got to find the time to look back
Let down so many times before
Had to find something more
I've been pushed aside, but in the end I just keep pushing back
Been left behind, but I found something more
And what i found helped me turn it around
But I'll never forget...
I understand that look in your eyes
And the story of your life tells me
That we've travelled different roads but on the same path
You've been pushed aside, but in the end you just keep pushing back
Been left behind, but you found something more
And what you found helped you turn it around
And what we found won't let us ever forget
That we've been betrayed
Had to find something more
I can learn to forgive, but never to forget
Because we've been betrayed
This is the power
Since time began
Every single hour
That we have known
And from each moment
All that is left
Sleep of the innocent
Just one desire

Shine like it does
Into every heart
Shine like it does
And if you're looking
You will find it

This is the story
Since time began
There will come a day
When we will know

Shine like it does
Into every heart
Shine like it does
And if you're looking
You will find it

Shine like it does
Into every heart
Shine like it does
And if you're looking
You will find it

Bad news travels fast
The rumours are flyin'
Worlds can collide
Without even tryin'
You left me high and dry
A flood of emotion
Promised me everything
Cried you an ocean

You keep me so mystified
Magic still alive and well
You keep me so mystified
Can't seem to break the spell

Heart beat through the night
Full moon's prowlin'
Your voice in the wind
Demons are howlin'
Lost in the wilderness
Seeds of obsession
Harvest of emptiness
Soul in possession

As I pick up my guitar to sing another song
I hear the walls of this old hall - you've done this thing too long
You know you've been around for years, I guess you've shown us all
I talk like this when I reminisce with an old time country hall
I joined a tent show as a kid with a dream and an old guitar
The Silvers All-Star Cavalcade and Dandy was the star
He taught me lots about the game, today I understand
He was a great magician, Dandy was a fine old man
I'm a howlin' cattle-hand crooner
I'm an old time dinosaur

Hey, let me sing where the rafters ring
In an old time country hall, that's right
I've been on the road for thirty years but Dandy could double that
And you'll find his faded poster still in some hall way out back
I like to go back stage and dream sometimes and just recall
The shows I've had, the good and bad, shared with these country halls
Take the old Town Hall Kalgoorlie with it's old time charm and grace
And your mounting million complexes never will replace
All glass and steal and concrete, some large and some too small
So let me sing where the rafters ring in an old time country hall, hey
We showed last night in the school of arts and the town was real run-down
You'll find so many towns like that today as you move around
Yeah, the wind of change is blowin' up such an economic low
The old time shows we used to know will soon be off the road
I'm a howlin' cattle-hand crooner
I'm an old time dinosaur
Hey, let me sing where the rafters ring
In an old time country hall
In an old time country hall
In an old time country hall
It began when they come took me from my home
And put me in Dead Row,
Of which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know.
And I'll say it again
I..am..not..afraid..to..die.

I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields,
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner meals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of truth.
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

Interpret signs and catalogue
A blackened tooth, a scarlet fog.
The walls are bad. Black. Bottom kind.
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath gathering at my hind

I hear stories from the chamber
How Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
Died upon the cross
And might I say it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told

Like my good hand I
tatooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist.

In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold.
Down here it's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away.

Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied.

My kill-hand is called E.V.I.L.
Wears a wedding band that's G.O.O.D.
`Tis a long-suffering shackle
Collaring all that rebel blood.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of truth.
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this weighing up of truth.
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this looks of disbelief.
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway there was no proof
Nor a motive why.

And the mercy seat is smoking
And I think my head is melting
And in a way I'm helping
To be done with all this twisted of the truth.
A lie for a lie
And a truth for a truth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is melting
And I think my blood is boiling
And in a way I'm spoiling
All the fun with all this truth and consequence.
An eye for an eye
And a truth for a truth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof.
A life for a life
And a truth for a truth
And anyway there was no proof
But I'm not afraid to tell a lie.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of truth.
An eye for an eye
And a truth for a truth
And anyway I told the truth
But I'm afraid I told a lie.
Meet me down by the jetty landing
Where the the pontoons bump and spray
I see the others reading, standing
As the Manly Ferry cuts its way to Circular Quay
Hear the Captain blow his whistle
So long shes been away
I miss our early morning wrestle
Not a very Happy way to start the day
She don't like That kind of behaviour x 2

So, throw down your guns
Don't be so reckless
Throw down your guns
Don't be so

Feel like Scott of the Antarctic
Base camp too far away
A Russian sun beneath the Arctic
Burke and Wills and camels
Initials in the tree
She don't like That kind of behaviour x 2

Everybody's pinching their guts
Young lumps of lead, floating on the harbour
They pick themselves up, now they're falling down again
Big lumps of lead floating to fruition
La la la
Like tickets worn, sometimes stolen
Like foreign languages, squashed into the ferry floor
One ticklish kiss will kill the itch around our ankles
And today moves in wave motion
Tomorrow's failing in the bath
And big lumps of lead, floating out to Pinchgut
And your eyes, watching this, they begin to cry
Your eyes, one ticklish kiss, they begin to cry
Your eyes, lumps of lead, they begin to cry
La la la
Tracy, Tracy was angry
A bad mood, a bad mood
I told her that it's an ill wind
Blows no good, blows no good

Then she told me
Tojo never made it
Tojo never made it to Darwin
Tojo never made it
Tojo never made it to Drwin

I said, Tracy, won't you listen, this is Christmas, honey
Don't you go, uh uh, don't you go
She said, David, believe me, I wouldn't miss this for the world
I've got to blow, I've got to blow

She said again
Tojo never made it
Tojo never made it to Darwin
Tojo never made it
Tojo never made it to Darwin

Now she's gone, gone, gone
Just like the wind
I just sigh, I just sigh
But I'm dreaming that I'm gleaming
In her eye, in her eye

But I'll always hear
(Tojo never made it)
Tojo never made it to Darwin
Tojo never made it
Tojo never made it to Darwin
Tojo never made it to Darwin
She said never made it to Darwin
Never made it to Darwin
That year Santa never came
I'm high on the hill
Looking over the bridge
To the M.C.G.
And way up on high
The clock on the silo
Says eleven degrees 

I remember I remember
I'm breathing today
The month of May
All the burning leaves
I'm not hearing a sound
My feet don't even
Touch the ground 

I remember I remember
I go leaps and bounds
Down past the river
And across the playing fields
The fields all empty
Only for the burning leaves 

I remember I remember
I go leaps and bounds
I remember everything
There's no sign on the gate
And there's mud on your face
Don't you think it's time we re-investigate this situation
Put some fruit on your plate

You've forgotten how it started
Close your eyes
Think of all the bubbles of love we made

And you're down on your knees
It's too late, oh don't come crawlin'
And you lie by my feet
What a big mistake, I see you fallin'

Got a buzz in my head
And my flowers are dead
Can't figure out a way to rectify this situation
Don't believe what you said

You've forgotten how it started
Close your eyes
Think of all the bubbles of love we made

And you're down on your knees
It's too late, oh don't come crawlin'
And you lie by my feet
What a big mistake, I see you fallin'

I could sting like a bee
Careful how you treat me
Baby, I don't think I'll accept your sorry invitation
Close the door as you leave

You forgotten how it started
Close your eyes
Think of all the bubbles of love we made

And you're down on your knees
It's too late, oh don't come crawlin'
And you lie by my feet
What a big mistake, I see you fallin'

And you cry over me
I can't wait, I feel you stallin'
And you try to reach me
What a big mistake, I hear you callin'

And you're down on your knees
It's too late, oh don't come crawlin'
And you lie by my feet
What a big mistake (big mistake), I see you fallin'
And another thing
I've been wondering lately
Oh, baby
Tell me, where have you been?
Now the stage is set
Where's my Juliet, baby?
Is it maybe
My Midsummer Night's Dream?

What's my scene?
What's my scene?
What's my scene?
Tell me, what's my scene?

Uh-huh

Like a talent scout
Always checking out new blood
Oh, I'd do good
If you tell me your game
Playing Solitaire
Doesn't get me where you would
And, honey, you could
Play by any rules that name

What's my scene?
What's my scene?
What's my scene?
Tell me, I gotta know
(What's my, what's my)
(What's my, what's my scene?)
(What's my, what's my)
(What's my, what's my scene?)

They say, yeah, they say
Making love, you can make it pay
They say, yeah, they say
But we know there's a better way
Any day

And another thing
I've been wondering lately
Am I crazy
To believe in ideals?
Well, I'm a betting man
But it's getting damn lonely
Oh, honey, if only
I was sure what I feel

What's my scene?
What's my scene?
What's my scene?
Tell me, I gotta know
(What's my, what's my)
(What's my, what's my scene?)
(What's my, what's my)
(What's my, what's my scene?) Ah, what's my scene?
(What's my, what's my) I wanna know
(What's my, what's my scene?) well, I concede
(What's my, what's my)
(What's my, what's my scene?)

I've been caught in someone else's scene (but that's not me)
Where, oh where, oh where can my scene be?
Please answer me
What's my

Ross Ryan Lyrics - I Am Pegasus Lyrics 

I am Pegasus, my name mea-eans horse
And I can fly-y with you
But I've changed my course
I am Michael, I am Jeffery and John
And I don't have to leave you
But I shall be gone

I am Genesis, I have no-o fear
I make my plans to land for
I plan to stay here
I am Simon, I am Demetrius and John
And I don't want to leave you
Unless you want me gone

I am fly-ying, but let me down
Oh I don't need the thi-ings
That once kept me around
It's not too late
To know who I am
I am Sagitarius

I am fly-yin' but let me down
Oh I don't need the thi-ings 
That once kept me around
It's not too late
Do you know who I a-am

I am Pegasus, my name mea-eans horse
And I can fly-y with you now
But I've changed my course
I am Michael, I am Jeffery and John
And I don't have to leave you

I am Pegasus, my name mea-eans horse
And I ca-an fly-y with you now
But I've changed my course
I am Michael, I am Jeffery
I am Demetrius and John
And I don't have to leave you, no
No-no-no-no [fade] 

MARIINLINE
Macainsh

I'd like to be in love but love's not good enough
Good enough a reason to be in love these days
There's too much goin' on, there's too much that's goin' wrong
Goin' wrong to be in love these days

Well, the girls in front are on mandrax
They're all dancin' in three-quarter time
Waitin' for the next band to touch down
And buy them a whiskey and lime
The boys up the back they're all drinking beer
They don't know what to do with their hands
They'd like to grab the girl with the mink eyebrows
But they're too nervous to make any plans

They like to be in love but love's not good enough
Good enough a reason to be in love these days
Everyone's got high ideals they know exactly how it feels
To be the one to turn the wheels these days

An old sweetheart is cryin' in her vodka
Waitin' six months for a smile
From a man who's too busy with his new-found fame
He's playin' it cool for a while
A new lover says come on over here
Another wants a date right now
For some double talk and cigarettes
Before the night turns sour

They'd like to be in love but love's just not enough
Not enough to be in love these days
There's too much goin' on, there's too much that's goin' wrong
Goin' wrong to be in love these days

You said that you wanted me
Whenever you were free
You handed me your front door key
While I analyzed your strategy
Offered me some lemon tea
Questioned my fidelity
Bit my ear and felt my knee
While I gave you the third degree

'Cos love's not good enough, love's not good enough
Love's not good enough
Love's not good enough good enough good enough...etc

We all want different things
But we all want to live like kings
We all want the best there is these days
Yeah it's just too tough
Yeah it gets so rough
'Cos love's not good enough these days
Do, do, do, do. Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do. Do, do, do do

Don't tell me your name, just use that pretty mouth
To kiss me if you want this, but I want you inside out
Start here at the end and later, when we're waking
Our bodies still weak, we finally meet, turn my head and say

We could be perfect strangers, let's spend tonight
We could be perfect strangers, hello, won't you look in my eyes?
Don't let this bad world change you
You got places to go, so much further than I can see

We could be perfect strangers
Thank you for spending one night with me

Do, do, do, do. Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do. Do, do, do do

Let's just keep this simple
In the AM it's goodbye
The syrup's so much sweeter when you let the butter fly
So spread your wings and go, it's better not to know
What I'm gonna miss, I'll remember your kiss when I turn my head and say

We could be perfect strangers, let's spend tonight
We could be perfect strangers, hello, won't you look in my eyes?
Don't let this bad world change you
You got places to go, so much further than I can see

We could be perfect strangers
Thank you for spending one night with me

We are passing trains, we are whiplash lovers
We are burning wax melting all over each other

We could be perfect strangers, let's spend tonight
We could be perfect strangers, hello, won't you look in my eyes?
Don't let this bad world change you
You got places to go, so much further than I can see

Everyone wants you but nobody knows that you're so alone inside
We could be perfect strangers
Thank you for spending one night
I've felt you coming girl, as you drew near
I knew you'd find me, cause I longed you here
Are you my desitiny? Is this how you'll appear?
Wrapped in a coat with tears in your eyes?
Well take that coat babe, and throw it on the floor
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?

As you've been moving surely toward me
My soul has comforted and assured me
That in time my heart it will reward me
And that all will be revealed
So I've sat and I've watched an ice-age thaw
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?

Out of sorrow entire worlds have been built
Out of longing great wonders have been willed
They're only little tears, darling, let them spill
And lay your head upon my shoulder
Outside my window the world has gone to war
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?

O we will know, won't we?
The stars will explode in the sky
O but they don't, do they?
Stars have their moment and then they die

There's a man who spoke wonders though I've never met him
He said, "He who seeks finds and who knocks will be let in"
I think of you in motion and just how close you are getting
And how every little thing anticipates you
All down my veins my heart-strings call
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?

Summer days and summer breezes flowers everywhere
Are all that I remember of times we used to share
Summer nights and summer beaches flowing into fall
That's all I can remember all that I recall

I remember seasons when you weren't so far away
I still can hear your laughter and things you used to say
Sheltered from the world behind the ivy-covered wall
That's all I can remember all that I recall

Somewhere above me
Your smiling face warm embrace fill my mind
I know you love me
And you're the one for whom the sun will always shine

So my love the more I think the more I want to say
Your love to me is sunshine and laughing summer days
Once again I realize I loved you most of all
That's all I can remember all that I recall
I am the captain of a ghostly crew
Sail the seven seas with nothing to do
The girl that I thought was untrue
Really loved me, boo hoo hoo

Near hidden reefs we appear in the gloom
Luring mariners to their doom
As we're condemned, we condemn others too
Who would love me? Who? Who?
Would you?

I'm on the Death Ship
I sail the sea alone
Death Ship - I can call no port home
Lost souls cry to Hell in the wind
Let us in, let us in

Death Ship - I sail the sea alone
Death Ship - I can call no port home
Lost souls cry to Hell in the wind
Let us in, let us in, you've got to let us in

I need somebody who will die for me
To free me of this misery
I need someone to cry for me
Really love me, really
Really love me, really
Really love me, really
Really love me, really love me
Love me
(well) You ask me 'bout the clothes I wear
And you ask me why I grow my hair
And you ask me why I'm in a band
I dig doin' one night stands
and You wanna see me do my thing
All you gotta do is plug me into high

I said high
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, High voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll
rock 'n' roll

You ask me why I like to dance
And you ask me why I like to sing
And you ask me why I like to play
I got to get my kicks some way
and You ask me what I'm all about
Come and let me hear you shout high

I said high
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, High voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll
rock 'n' roll

I said high, I said high
Waaaah!
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll
(mumble, mumble...)
Spotlight, put the lights out, happy hour!
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Wine, women and song
High voltage, high voltage
Wine women and song
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Stars, bars all around...spotlights, footlights... I take 'em!

por Erik Kyo
Ever since the world began
Men have sailed to foreign lands
And the fortunes that they've found
Are now buried in the ground

Some would say the ocean roars
As it stumbles to the shore
But to me it only sings
Of the sorrow that it brings

All my friends are dead
Or they're dying
Empty laughter turns into crying
It's death-defying

Well, I barely learned to swim
Just enough to save my skin
Now I'll never sail alone
And my harbour is my home

All our friends are dead
Or they're dying
And our laughter only turns into crying
It's death-defying

If there's one thing that I've learned
It's the point of no return
And if that's to be our fate
Now's no time to hesitate

When my baby
When my baby smiles at me I go to Rio
De Janeiro, my-oh-me-oh
I go wild and then I have to do the Samba
And La Bamba
Now I`m not the kind of person
With a passionate persuasion for dancin`
Or roma-ancin`
But I give in to the rhythm
And my feet follow the beatin` of my hear-eart
Woh-ho-oh-oh, when my baby
When my baby smiles at me I go to Rio
De Janeiro
I`m a Salsa fellow
When my baby smiles at me
The sun`ll lightens up my li-ife
And I am free at last, what a blast
Woh-ho-oh-oh, when my baby
When my baby smiles at me
I feel like Tarzan, of the Jungle
There on the hot sand
And in a bungalow while monkeys play above-a
We-ee make love-a
Now I`m not the type to let vibrations (Rio...)
Trigger my imagination easily (Rio...)
You know that`s just not me
But I turn into a tiger (Rio...)
Everytime I get beside the - one I love (Rio...)
Woh, oh, woh, woh-oh..., Rio... - Rio...
Yeah Ugh - Rio... - Ugh
Woh-ho-oh-oh, when my ba-a-aby (when my baby)
When my baby smiles at me I go to Rio (Rio...)
De Janeiro
I`m a Salsa fellow-ow
When my baby smiles at me
The sun`ll lightens u-up my li-ife
And I am free at last, what a blast
When my baby (when my baby)
When my baby smiles at me I go to Rio (Rio...)
That`s when I go to Rio (Rio)
Rio - Rio De Janeir-eiro
Rio...., Rio...., Rio....
Can you divide the meaning
By the number of your words?
The money in your pocket
By the masters that you serve?
Its not the destination
Its whats around the curve

Coming over to come down
Gotta talk to you before I hit the ground
Yeah I think its gonna take all night

The week is slippin' away from me
Something isnt right
Might be better to sweat it out
But I dont know how to fight myself anymore

Coming over to come down
Gotta talk to you before I hit the ground
Yeah I think its gonna take all night

Takes me a while to taper off
I like a long ramp down
So I am a little shaky
A little moisture on my brow

Mailman came this morning
Brought a message by
Said it was from my babe
Think I know just why

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry that I
Didn't go last night

Had a date at seven
With a girl named Fleur
Then I just remembered, had a date with her

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry that I
Didn't go last night
Yeah

Mailman came this morning
Brought a message by
Said it was from my babe
Think I know just why

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry that I
Didn't go last night
Didn't go last night
Didn't go last night

[X14]
Yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi

Ooh woh ooh woh oh
Ooh woh ooh woh oh, ooh yeah

What it is a burning flame
A fire out of control
What it is a chance in the world
For sanity down the road
What it is a simple thing
That everybody needs
What it is the chance to bring
All of us together

Love somebody
Love somebody
Love somebody
Got to love somebody

Ooh woh ooh woh oh
Ooh woh ooh woh oh

What it is I'll say it again
'Cause everybody needs
What it is a simple thing
All of us together
What it is a burning flame
A fire out of control
What it is a chance in the world
For sanity down the road

Ooh woh ooh woh oh
Ooh woh ooh woh oh

What it is what it is
What it is what it is
Huh!
When the sun sets over Carlton
And the moonlight floods the streets
All those pizza places and spaced out places
They all get on the beat

When the sun sets over Carlton
And the stars begin to shine
All those grey-haired writers and drunken fighters
They all step out in line

When the sun sets over Carlton
And the day begins to fade
All those night time junkies and long haired monkeys
They all pull up the shade

When the sun sets over Carlton
And the lights begin to glow
All those Divine Lighters and window wipers
They all put on a show

When the sun sets over Carlton
And you're out to make a deal
Check out who you're talkin' to
And make sure they are real

(rpt above verse)
Well Lygon Street's really got me beat
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Well Lygon Street's really got me down
'Cos I'm a poor boy on the wrong side of town

Do the Lygon Street Limbo
How low can you go-go
You can almost touch the ocean
Shimmering in the distant haze
As you stand there on the mountain
On this loveliest day of days
Round half the world you've drifted
Left no wild oats unsown
But now your view has shifted
And you think you've just come home
REPEAT INTRO
And you're drowning in the sunshine
As it pours down from the sky
And there's something stirring in your heart
Bright colours fill your eyes
As from here to the far horizon
Your beauty does unfold
And oh, you look so lovely
Dressed in green and gold
To the homeless and the hungry
May we always open doors
May the restless and the weary
Find safe harbour on our shores
May she always be our dreamtime place
Our spirit's glad release
May she always be our shelter
May we always live in peace
REPEAT INTRO
I died at the hands of an angel
Gently betrayed with a kiss
And all my dreams com tumbling down
What i've found
Well i was
Lost
Without you i was
Lost
Without a trace
Lost
Never to be found

I cried and turned up the radio
So no one would hear i was down
So no one knew the trouble i had
Yeah i had it bad
Well i was
Lost
Without you i was
Lost
Without a trace
Lost
You know that i was
Lost
Without you i was
Lost
Loosing faith, i was
Lost
Never to be found

Under the wide open skies
Love disappears before my eyes
Down a road that leads nowhere
There i stopped
Looked around
We walk on common ground
Now everybody's
Lost
The way that i was
Lost
Without a trace
Lost
Tell you i was
Lost
Without you i was
Lost
Loosing faith
Lost
Never to be found
No never to be found
Sure that i was
Lost
Forever to be
Forever to be
Well i was

It's been a long and winding journey
But I'm finally here tonight
I'm picking up the pieces
And walking back into the light
Into the sunset of your glory
Where my heart and future lies
There's nothing like that feeling
When I look into your eyes

My dreams came true when I found you
I found you, my miracle

If you could see what I see
That you're the answer to my prayers
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know, it would be clear
That angels brought me here

Standing here before you
Feels like I've been born again
Every breath is your love
Every heartbeat speaks your name

My dreams came true right here in front of you
My miracle

If you could see what I see
You're the answer to my prayer
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know, it would be clear
That angels brought me here

Brought me here to be with you
I'll be forever grateful, ohh forever thankful

My dreams came true
When I found  my miracle

If you could see what I see
You're the answer to my prayers, oh-h-h-h-h
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know, it would be clear
That angels brought me here

You know I love you baby
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know, it would be clear
That angels brought me here
Kids out driving Saturday afternoon pass me by
I'm just savouring familiar sights
We share some history, this town and I
And I can't stop that long forgotten feeling of her
Try to book a room to stay tonight

Number one is to find some friends to say "You're doing well
After all this time you boys look just the same"
Number two is the happy hour at one of two hotels
Settle in to play "Do you remember so and so?"
Number three is never say her name

Oh the flame trees will blind the weary driver
And there's nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change, there's no pace
Everything within its place
Just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around

But Ah! Who needs that sentimental bullshit, anyway
Takes more than just a memory to make me cry
I'm happy just to sit here round a table with old friends
And see which one of us can tell the biggest lies

There's a girl falling in love near where the pianola stands
With her young local factory out-of-worker, holding hands
And I'm wondering if he'll go or if he'll stay

Do you remember, nothing stopped us on the field
In our day

Oh the flame trees will blind the weary driver
And there's nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change, there's no pace
Everything within its place
Just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around

Oh the flame trees will blind the weary driver
And there's nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change, there's no pace
Everything within its place
Just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York island
From the Redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

As I was walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me

I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me, a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me

When the sun came shining and I was strolling
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
As the fog was lifting, a voice was chanting
This land was made for you and me

As I went walking, I saw a sign there
On the sign it said 'No Trespassing'
But on the other side it didn't say nothing
That side was made for you and me!

In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people
By the relief office, I seen my people
As they stood there hungry I stood there asking
Is this land made for you and me?

Nobody living can ever stop me
As I go walking that freedom highway
Nobody living can make me turn back
This land was made for you and me
Well I heard it on the radio
And I saw it on the television
Back in 1988
All those talking politicians
Words are easy, words are cheap
Much cheaper than our priceless land
But promises can disappear
Just like writing in the sand

Treaty Yeh Treaty Now
Treaty Yeh Treaty Now

This land was never given up
This land was never bought and sold
The planting of the Union Jack
Never changed our law at all

Now two rivers run their course
Separated for so long
I'm dreaming of a brighter day
When the waters will be one

Treaty Yeh Treaty Now Treaty Yeh Treaty Now

But promises can be broken Just like writing in the sand

Treaty Yeh
Treaty Now ....
Don't let there be
Something sour in my coffee
There's fourteen year olds
Screaming get out of my country
I won't let him rise just to say goodbye
Hourly, daily
The August cold
Brings something bad in its sock drawer
There's too much hate
Covering up those once white walls
I don't want my boy thinking I'm only to avoid
Tread safe hourly, daily

He's the splitting image and the oldest of two
Now what kind of mess have you gone and gotten yourself into?

Make a morning pledge
To the heart of the city quiet
Pray the daybreak sun
Can fill up the halls of a sleepless night
Bring one good face into this house today
Hourly, daily

He's the splitting image and the oldest of two
Now what kind of mess have you gone and gotten yourself into?
I was right
I was right
Oh, the sun, the sun
The sun is rising from the field

I've got a feeling
I just can't shake
I've got a feeling
That just won't go away

You've got to just
Keep on pushing
Keep on pushing
Push the sky away

And if your friends think
That you should do it different
And if they think
That you should do it the same

You've got to just
Keep on pushing
Keep on pushing
Push the sky away

And if you're feeling
You've got everything you came for
If you got everything
And you don't want no more

You've got to just
Keep on pushing
Keep on pushing
Push the sky away

And some people
Say it's just rock'n roll
Oh, but it gets you
Right down to your soul

You've got to just
Keep on pushing
Keep on pushing
Push the sky away
When you wake up in the morning of the night before
And there's someone knocking’ on your front door
And you haven't got a drink and you're sick to the core
You've got what they call a hangover
Well your head is splitting and your stomachs in pain
And you tremble when you hear that knock again
And you're certain that the knocker is the law that's plain
Oh you think the worst with a hangover
Well you try to think back on the night before
You've got a vague recollection but you're not too sure
You were out with a woman it's her husband for sure
It's a dreadful thing a hangover
Oh you drove home drunk but you think you were right
But you seem to recall going through red lights
It's the law at the door and he's got you in his sights
It all looks bad with a hangover
Oh you look into the mirror and you've got a black eye
And there's blood on your shirt from the other guy
Must be him at the door I wish I could die
Would be better than this hangover
Well you pluck up courage and you open up the door
Expecting a punch or a bluey from the law
Or a jealous husband with a gun in his paw
At least it would end this hangover
Well strike me pink you near drop dead
Why it's Don and Bert and Stan and Ned
With a carton of coldies for your aching head
Medicine for a hangover
Well you start to recover and get a couple down
You think things over oh weren’t you a clown
To worry if the law or a husband came round
Ohhh it must have been a bad hangover
So you all head off to the local once more
And you're a little self conscious as you walk through the door
But at closing time you're as bad as before
And you're in for another hangover
Oh show me the way to go home cause you're in for another hangover
Way down in Tresco
They're takin' it slow
Keepin' the faith child
Watchin' it flow
Here in the hothouse
They wait in the dark
Try to make love
Just to tear it apart

High on the mountain
They answer the call
Raised up to the glory
Safe if you fall

Back in the sweatbox
You crawl to her door
Lean on the Number
Collapse on the floor

We all got the deadline blues
Sorry boy, you lose

Safe in the country
It's just what it seems
Riding on hope
While you live out your dreams

Trapped in the pit
They still shiver in fright
You might belong
But it's hell here tonight

We all got the deadline blues
Sorry boy, you lose
We all got the deadline blues
Honey now light that fuse

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)
She said she came from Portland
Where the ashen skies and leaden ocean
Left her like the local boys, barren of emotion
As we talked we watched the raindrops
Running down the window
Laundromat in Darlinghurst
Like a fish shop from the past

And her mother called her Mary
After Mary Magdalene
To deny her beauty
Would have been the greatest sin
It was a profile in the neon and a Kings Cross Doorway lean
To half an hour of tending someone else's tangled dream

There were lines of sailors, lines of speed
Lines upon the Footpath where she stared
When things were quiet, as night deferred to dawn
And the coke cups played red rover
In the breeze that scuttled through the streets
Taxies left for greener fields
While Sydney stretched and yawned

And her mother called her Mary

After Mary Magdalene
There were virgins in the morning
She had sisters in the pain;
And the wives would clutch their husbands
Perhaps they shared the shame
'cause working streets and Weddingrings are sometimes much the same

She tap-danced with the buskers
Near the subway shouting blues songs
They remembered from their teenage years of dreamtime radio
And the years withdrew behind her eyes
To let the little girl look out
In simple childish innocence
At drawings in the sand

And her mother called her Mary
After Mary Magdalene
She had long dark hair and massage oil
And a key to let you in;
And the lines upon her face were maps of roads she'd travelled
Lined with people throwing stones because they didn't understand
That a half an hour of tenderness (perhaps they shared the same)
'cause working streets and Weddingrings are sometimes much the same

Set the wheels in motion, and watch them turning round
I want to sail across the ocean, I've grown weary of this town

Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, It's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down

In this city full of danger, we lead our separate lives
And I was frightened by a stranger, with desperation in her eyes

Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down

Someone turned the pressure on
I called your name and you were gone
And I was trapped like a prisoner in this lonely town
I'm gonna let things slide, until the pressure comes down

Oh the winner tells his story, the loser hides in shame
The winner steals the glory, while the loser takes the pain

Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down

Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down

Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down

Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down

Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down
Oh, pretty Emma, you sweet pretender
Why don't you stay around
What's your dilemma, won't you please tell me, Emma
I don't wanna lay you down

Sometimes it's hard to bend
Turn around, you better start all over again
(Please tell me Emma, please tell me Emma)

Don't get excited you'll be invited
Wait for the wheel to turn
Don't be impatient you'll get liberated
Everybody's got to learn

You have got to make a contribution
Then you can start to draw your own conclusion
(Please tell me, Emma, please tell me, Emma)
(Please tell me, Emma, please tell me, Emma)

Emma, Emma, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting
Emma, Emma, oh, oh, oh

Sometimes it's hard to bend
Turn around, you'd better start all over again, all over again
(Please tell me, Emma, please tell me, Emma)
(Please tell me, Emma, please tell me, Emma)

Emma, Emma, you'd better start relating (start relating)

Oh, pretty Emma, you sweet pretender
Why don't you stay around
Oh, pretty Emma, you sweet pretender
I don't wanna lay you, lay you, lay you down
Oh, pretty Emma, you sweet pretender
I don't wanna lay you down
Oh, pretty Emma
Were you laughed at by your friends
And were you lost for words when everybody finally told you what they thought
You can't keep up with the trend
It makes you lose but somehow everybody always makes up in the end
Oh, was it something that I ate
Oh, didn't even touch my plate
Oh, suddenly I'm feeling great
Do you like me now

Leaving home, life was never good to me
Leaving home, I smell the morning air
Leaving home, life was never good
You can work it out we're leaving home

I could hear them through the door
As people came in laughing at the way they acted when they were alone
And an argument can start with nothing more than this
To be the light and leave you standing on your own
Oh, am I doing it again
Oh, I'm a loser now and then
Oh, and I smile at everything
Do you like me now

Hope I like the life I find when I leave everything behind
I hope I'm sure I've made my mind to go and leave home

Your eyes are like, deep wells of desire
Once in your arms, I'm on fire
You were sent girl so, perfectly true
Changing my life now, I'm a survivor

Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Heaven sent
That's what I call you

Late at night, when the evening fire has died
There's a look in your eye
Seductive images fly

Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Heaven sent

One day you'll see, what angels can see
Dressed in black, if she comes back
I think I'll lose my mind

Tuesday she works in the library uptown
Some useful knowledge can always be found
Don't burn the library till you've read all the books
Sometimes in life you get a second look

If you're looking for parts
I got what you need
I got a heart tin plated
And a soul of steel
Or take me as I am and just
Drive me away
I might look like a wreck
But my ride is still OK
Pile me with your love junk
I'm your junkyard man
Pile me with your love junk
I'm a junkyard man

First verse

I was left by the wayside
By my previous owner
She took me for a day
See I was just a loaner
She found me at the body shop
Where her other had broken down
It was love at first sight
So she drove me out of town

I was rustin' away
Till ya found me here
My motor was chokin'
And I just couldn't steer
But just when I thought
I'd never get a buyer
Well you juiced me right up
And you put air in my tires

You might get a little dirty
But baby never you mind
I ain't some squeaky clean wheeler
I know I'm covered in grime
But I just keep rollin'
With a reputation that's soiled
I ain't got no log books
And no one's ever checked my oil

First verse and chorus

Black fingernails, red wine
I wanna make you, all mine
Lotta people, underground
You wanna get there
You gotta go straight down

(Woah Oh)
Straight down (Woah Oh)

There’s a culture, everywhere
Smoke clouds, hang in the air
So loud, cant hear you talk
You can lie
Or take a walk downtown (Woah Oh)

Straight down (Woah Oh)
Downtown (Woah Oh)
Straight down (Woah Oh)

the argument over god continues (in this house)
all of us stand and point our fingers (to the ground)
all of us stand and point our fingers....

(Woah Oh) 
Straight down (Woah Oh)

Red letter day, black heart
Its gonna tear you, all apart
So loud, cant hear you call
You and I
Gotta fall straight down (Woah Oh)

Straight Down (Woah oh)
Downtown (Woah oh)
Straight down (Woah oh)

(Woah Oh) 
Straight down (Woah Oh) x3

Black fingernails, red wine
I wanna make you, all mine
Lotta people, underground
You wanna get there
You gotta go straight down

the argument over all continues (in this house)
all of us stand and point our fingers (to the ground)
all of us stand and point our fingers

(Woah Oh)
Straight down (Woah Oh) x3
White door, ninth floor, silent number, it's autumn on a cold avenue
Telex intercept, he sips a cigarette, warms up his V.D.U

He gets his kicks from microchips, orders from the C.I.A
Birobugs and lasers, casual surveillance, boardrooms and communiques

Don't use your phone and don't use mine
Don't speak treason, they're tapping the li-ine

Break-in, stake out, tell it in code
Everything is legal, anything goes
The nights gettin' darker and the ill wind blows
Your life's in a databank at ASIO

Trained in the ghettos of the Lebanon, truncheons and an M16
Selling skag, a U.N. flag, now he's trading in securities

Darwin rendezvous, a B-52, trenchcoat slightly creased
From a coup in Asia, A U.S. Air Force major
Buying dirty laundry, swearin' it's for peace

Infiltration, we'll never know
Just like Chile but the bruises don't show-ow

Break-in, stake out, tell it in code
Everything is legal, anything goes
The nights get darker and the ill wind blows
Your life's in a databank at ASIO

Spook behind the bar, unmarked car, rumour hangs like stale perfume
Flushing under beds, sniffin' out the Reds, nobody can feel immune

No names, no stress, no blame, no press
Clean when the dirty work's done
Allocate a budget, special branch thugs
Do it for the practice, do it for the fun

Midnight, flashlight, crash on the door
Rats on the table, blood on the floor-oor

Break-in, stake out, tell it in code
Everything is legal, anything goes
The nights get darker and the ill wind blows
Your life's in a databank at ASIO
Don't look at my waist 'cause the pants don't fit right
I'm a dedicated follower of skin tight
As long as we don't eat everything will be fine
I just want to look fascinating, snorting the diet pills I'm grating
As long as we throw up everything will be fine
As long as we're emasciated
Tastes outdated, yeah, everything will be fine

Everytime I eat is a slate away from every photo that I emulate
As long as my fingers fit everything will be fine
Cheeks like a valley and ribs like grater
But just think of all that cash I'm saving
As long as we throw up everything will be fine

As long as we're emasciated
Taste out dated, yeah, everything will be fine

It will be fine. It will be fine

Make me grow up
At the devil's party nothing's a sin
At the devil's party we know where you've been
If we're all right then tell me who's wrong
The love in a war, where do we belong?

I might believe it's love, you might believe it's war

At the devil's party there's no light from the sun
At the devil's party, now, life's a loaded gun
More or less? No, less is more
Go on and be my guest
Where do we belong?

I might believe it's love, you might live a little more

Dreams of yours, dreams of mine
Dreams of all that shine on the other side, on the other side

At the devil's party watch them stare in vain
At the devil's party, now, you're no friend of mine
Oh, lonely days of the road to excess
When you're on fire you burn like the rest

I might believe it's love, and you might believe it's war
Why don't we take a little less? Then we could live a little more

Dreams of yours, dreams of mine
Dreams of all that breathe on the other side, on the other side

I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today

Long night leaves me stranded
Black vision, danger sign
No love, need protection
Feels like I'm on production line
Daggers of dawn, cold hearted day
Why does it have to be morning?
Cover my head, stayin' in bed
Too late, the luckless warning

I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today

Outside, screaming city
Red lights and hungry eyes
Sucks like a space invader
The vacuum of it's lies
Stealing my strength, stealing my time
It's raining in a world of traders
I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day

Let me keep on sleeping
Forget that I'm alone
One day of faceless living
Is 24 hours too long

I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today

(Solo)

Give me the night, it's more forgiving
Hold back the light from my eyes
Please stay invisible darkness
Can't see the tears I cry
I know it's coming loaded with nothing
Trapped in a tunnel of time
I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day

I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today

I don't wanna face the day
Face the day
I don't wanna face the day
Don't wanna face the day
Ohh, face the day
Don't wanna face the day
Don't wanna face the day
Don't wanna face the day
Sitting in the shelter
Head between your knees
Can't afford the struggle
Can't afford to sleep
Got my gas mask on
Hey I'm lauughing like thers no tommorrow

All care no responsiblity is take for the
Heap of garbage on the side of the road
Got my back door covered but the beast is on the loose again

We the people who live next door
We are the ones you can feel through the floor

Back in the good old days
You paid a penny to the preacher
A pound of flesh to keep the planet alive
Pass around the pie
We're going to suck on this supper together

We got religon
We got the guns
We got the power to put out the sun
Come on everybody
Don't you know that you can dream forever

We the people who live next door
We are the ones you can feel through the floor
We got the power
But oh we are weak
We are brave in our silience
But we are to scared to seek
We will carry the impossible load
While our leaders weap by the side of the road

We've been dreaming so long
We've been taken so far from where we belong

We the people
We the people who live next door
We are the ones you can feel thought the floor
We are powerful
But oh we are weak
We are brave in our silience
But we are to scared to seek
We will carry the impossible load
While our leaders weap like children on the side of the road

"You've done it all
You've broken every code
And pulled the rebel to the floor
You've spoilt the game
No matter what you say
For only metal, what a bore

Blue eyes, blue eyes
How can you tell so many lies?

Come up and see me, make me smile
I'll do what you want, running wild

There's nothing left
All gone and run away
Maybe you'll tarry for a while
It's just a test
A game for us to play
Win or lose, it's hard to smile

Resist, resist
It's from yourself you'll have to hide

Come up and see me to make me smile
I'll do what you want, running wild

There ain't no more
You've taken everything
From my belief in Mother Earth
Can you ignore my faith in everything?
'Cos I know what faith is
And what it's worth

Away, away
And don't say maybe you'll try

To come up and see me, make me smile
I'll do what you want, just running wild"
Repeat to fade

I was hanging upside down from the overpass
Waiting to discover something about the world
I couldn't get with the program and I couldn't listen to them
It was like trying to think in reverse
And I don't want to slide into apathy
And I don't want to die in captivity
But these monsters follow me around
Hunting me down
Tryin to wipe me out

Wipe me out
Wipe me out
Wipe me out

Yeah I was hiding away under water
Waiting for distance and buying some time
Trying to be two hundred thousand years younger
So I could excuse myself from human kind
'Cos I don't want to be a container
Or a bastard with a ten page disclaimer
But these monsters spin me around
Get me down
Just try and shut me out

Shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me out

Hold it in your head
Hold it in your head
Hold it in your head (Believe in me, believe in me, believe)

I was hiding away under water (Shut me out)
Waiting for distance, waiting for time (Shut me out)
And I don't want to slide into apathy (Shut me out)
And I don't
and I don't want to live in captivity (Shut me out)
Shut me out (wooh...)
Shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me out

You and me, we have an opportunity
And we could make it something really cool
But you, you think I'm not that kind of girl
I'm here to tell ya' baby, I know how to rock your world

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't think that I'm not strong
I'm the one to take you on
Don't underestimate me boy
I'll make you sorry you were born
You don't know me
The way you really should
You're sure misunderstood

Don't call me baby
You've got to know now baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me baby

Behind my smile is my IQ
I must admit this does not sit with the likes of you
You're really sweet
Mmmm.. you're really nice
But didn't mama ever tell ya' not to play with fire

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't think that I'm not strong
I'm the one to take you on
Don't underestimate me boy
I'll make you sorry you were born
You don't know me
The way you really should
You're sure misunderstood

Don't call me baby
You've got to know now baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me baby

You and me, we have an opportunity
And we could make it something really cool
But you, you think I'm not that kind of girl
I'm here to tell ya' baby, I know how to rock your world

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't think that I'm not strong
I'm the one to take you on
Don't underestimate me boy
I'll make you sorry you were born
You don't know me
The way you really should
You're sure misunderstood

Don't call me baby
You've got to know now baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me baby
You've got to know now baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me baby
They got married early, never had no money
Then when he got laid off they really hit the skids
He started up his drinking, then they started fighting
He took it pretty badly, she took both the kids
She said: "I'm not standing by, to watch you slowly die
So watch me walking, out the door, out the door, out the door"
She said, "Shove it, Jack, I'm walking out the fucking door"

She went to her brother's, got a little bar work
He went to the Buttery, stayed about a year
Then he wrote a letter, said I want to see you
She thought he sounded better, she sent him up the fare
He was riding through the cane in the pouring rain
On Olympic to her door
To her door
To her door

He came in on a Sunday, every muscle aching
Walking in slow motion like he'd just been hit
Did they have a future?
Would he know his children?
Could he make a picture and get them all to fit?
He was shaking in his seat riding through the streets
In a silvertop to her....
Shaking in his seat riding through the streets
In a silvertop to her door
To her door
To her door
To her door

Enter, space capsule
Enter, space capsule

La di, la da
La di, la da

Wax the tracks

G-E-R-L-I-N-G
Enter, space capsule
G-E-R-L-I-N-G

Something good is going to happen to you

La di, la da
La di, la da

G-E-R-L-I-N-G
La di, la da
Shake your ass
La di, la da
A lonesome joker I've become
Crawling at your gate
I remember in my better days
I was not the one to wait
That leaving kiss is on your lips
That secret is all mine
And I'm handing down my calling card
To the hands of old man time

And you just might get lucky
You just might want to kiss the ground
'cause I'm giving out my calling card
To anyone around

I'm hanging up my mourning coat
I'm handing down my chains
I'm walking off this sinking boat
And nothing shall remain
I'm stepping out into the sun
Looking for my day
These simple things now I've received
Are bound to light my way

Won't you save me
For love is a fearless enemy
Won't you save me
I see these days become tomorrow
With only myself left to follow

I'll slide the pieces up my sleeve
I'll take the guilty down
The broken lovers I believe
Are better lost than found
They're burning letters by the fire
The river rolls and turns
I hear the whisper on the wire
The loser never learns
Macainsh

Saturday night and everybody's out boozin'
I get in my car and I go out cruisin'
Lookin' for a party, a chick or some dope
If it gets after midnight I don't give up hope

And if by chance I fail to connect
With a flash lookin' woman, I ain't to select
I'll roll on down and take a look at the rest
Ladies or liqueur I'll take second best

Saturday night
I'm driving'
You're drinkin'
I'm thinkin'
You're fine
And you're mine

Round about four I'll be right on top
A bit of luck with the pick of the crop
Rockin' and rollin' till the morning sun
Lights up my wagon then I'm on the run
Looka yonder! Looka yonder!
Looka yonder! A big black cloud come!
A big black cloud come!
O comes to Tupelo. Comes to Tupelo

Yonder on the horizon
Yonder on the horizon
Stopped at the mighty river
Stopped at the mighty river and
Sucked the damn thing dry
Tupelo-o-o, O Tupelo
In a valley hides a town called Tupelo

Distant thunder rumble. Distant thunder rumble
Rumble hungry like the Beast
The Beast it cometh, cometh down
The Beast it cometh, cometh down
Wo wo wo-o-o
Tupelo bound. Tupelo-o-o. Yeah Tupelo
The Beast it cometh, Tupelo bound

Why the hen won't lay no egg
Can't get that cock to crow
The nag is spooked and crazy
O God help Tupelo! O God help Tupelo!
O God help Tupelo! O God help Tupelo!

Ya can say these streets are rivers
Ya can call these rivers streets
Ya can tell ya self ya dreaming buddy
But no sleep runs this deep
No! No sleep runs this deep
No sleep runs this deep
Women at their windows
Rain crashing on the pane
Writing in the frost
Tupelos' shame. Tupelo's shame
O God help Tupelo! O God help Tupelo!

O go to sleep lil children
The sandmans on his way
O go to sleep lil children
The sandmans in his way
But the lil children know
They listen to the beating of their blood
listen to the beating of their blood
listen to the beating of their blood
listen to the beating of their blood
They listen to the beating of their blood
The sandman's mud!
The sandman's mud!
And the black rain come down
the black rain come down
the black rain come down
Water water everywhere
Where no bird can fly no fish can swim
Where no bird can fly no fish can swim
No fish can swim
Until The King is born!
Until The King is born!
In Tupelo! Tupelo-o-o!
Til The King is born in Tupelo!

In a clap-board shack with a roof of tin
Where the rain came down and leaked within
A young mother frozen on a concrete floor
With a bottle and a box and a cradle of straw
Tupelo-o-o! O Tupelo!
With a bottle and a box and a cradle of straw

Well Saturday gives what Sunday steals
And a child is born on his brothers heels
Come Sunday morn the first-born dead
In a shoebox tied with a ribbon of red
Tupelo-o-o! Hey Tupelo!
In a shoebox buried with a ribbon of red

O ma-ma rock you lil' one slow
O ma-ma rock your baby
O ma-ma rock your lil' one slow
O God help Tupelo! O God help Tupelo!
Mama rock your lil' one slow
The lil one will walk on Tupelo
The lil one will walk on Tupelo
Black rain come down, Black rain come down
Tupelo-o-o! Yeah Tupelo!
And carry the burden of Tupelo
Tupelo-o-o! O Tupelo! Yeah!
The King will walk on Tupelo!
Tupelo-o-o! O Tupelo!
He carried the burden outa Tupelo!
Tupelo-o-o! Hey Tupelo! [Repeat]
You will reap just what you sow
Yes it's me
I am the one
To make you see
Where we belong
I was shaking
Like a leaf
All wrapped up
In my dirty sheets
If I agree to what comes next
I would be faking
With the best of them
It seems a crime
I would commit
Without the difference
Of all the world's gifts

Sweet sweet sweet
Could you taste it

Never never never
Never never never (taste it)
To dream
All the time
Without a scream
In the dead of night
All those faces
Come back to me
I'll be begging
To swim that sea
Yea I made
A picture story
Make you cry
In all your glory
A need to quench
The thirst of many
To justify
And make ready

Sweet sweet sweet
Could you taste it

Never never never (taste it)
Never never never (taste it)
Never never never (taste it)
Never never never (taste it)

This realization
Owes us strength to show
If you're uncertain
You're invited to believe
These are the words I speak
These are the words I speak

A dislocation
From where we once came from
Give sons and daughters
Because we want to go on

These are the words she speaks
These are the words she speaks

Sweet sweet sweet
Could you taste it

Never never never (taste it)
Never never never (taste it)
Never never never (taste it)
Never never never (taste it)

Never never never
Never never never
Well just the other night I come home
After three months of constant grind and travel
And I went snivelling
I went crawling around to my girlfriend's house
And she came down hard upon me
And she ground her finger into my breastbone
And she said
She said: "You don't make me feel... like I'm a woman... anymore
And you don't make me feel like I'm a woman any more
You don't make me feel like I'm a woman any more

And I know
I know it's been a long time
Seems like it's been go-ing on forever
And my heart
My heart is beating
Too big

It's beating too big for the space that's meant to hold it
So good-night
Goodnight my little lovely
As we turn
As we turn down the lights
Say good-bye

Goodbye to the naked truth
Your skin is looking weary
And your eyes are closing down on the day
I know, I know it's been a long time
Seems like it's been going on forever

But just as black is white
Yeah and just as night is day
The light is going to leave you
And you're gonna fade away
So goodnight, goodbye my lovely
As we turn, as we turn down the lights
Say goodnight, goodnight to the naked truth
Your skin is looking weary
And your eyes are closing down on the day
(Yeah
All right
Sing it up, west coast
Too much!)

I'm just sitting in my chair when a voice comes on the air
Says "Why don't you try it? You'll feel all right!"
"Got some great new brand of smokes, cool your head and clear your throat
"Keeps you young, yeah, so in touch."

Cheap advertising, you're lying
Never gonna get me what I want
I said, smooth talking, brain washing
Ain't never gonna get me what I need

"Our new soap that's peachy keen saves your soul and keeps you clean
"It's recommended, used by the Queen
"Gonna improve your IQ, help in everything you do
"It's economic, don't cost too much."

Said advertising, you're lying
Never gonna give me what I want
I said, smooth talking, brain washing
Ain't never gonna get me what I need

(I said take it
Come on
Soul man
Let's shoot the professor!
Alright!)

I'm just sitting in my chair when a voice comes on the air
Says "Why don't you try it? You'll feel all right!"
"It's a great new brand of smokes
"Cool your head and clears your throat
"Keeps you young and so in touch."

Said advertising, you're lying
You're never gonna give me what I want
I said smooth talking, brain washing
You're never gonna get me what I need

(What do I care?
Yeah! Hey man
Where's the professor?
We need him now!
Gonna tell you 'bout them
Yeah we take it all the way 'round the world
For that west coast feel
Yeah man
Yeah everything, let it out
It's not what you love
Look out on the radio
All right
Yeah
Yeah...)

I found her on a night of fire and noise
Wild bells rang in a wild sky
I knew from that moment on
I'll love her till the day that I died
And I kissed away a thousand tears
My lady of the Various Sorrows
Some begged, some borowed, some stolen
Some kept safe for tomorrow
On and endless night, silver star spangled
The bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle

Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?

She was given to me to put things right
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside her
Still I seemed so obselete and small
I found God and all His devils inside her
In my bed she cast the blizzard out
A mock sun blazed upon her head
So completely filled with light she was
Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad
Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled
And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle

Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?

She had a heartful of love and devotion
She had a mindful of tyranny and terror
Well, I try, I do, I really try
But I just err, baby, I do, I error
So come find me, my darling one
I'm down to the grounds, the very dregs
Ah, here she comes, blocking the sun
Blood running down the inside of her legs
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled
bAnd the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle

Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?

All things move toward their end
I knew before I met her that I would lose her
I swear I made every effort to be good to her
I made every effort not to abuse her
Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles
And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle

Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?
Hello Dan, it's Joe here 
I hope you're keeping well 
Its the 21st of December 
now theyre ringing the last bell 
if I get good behaviour 
I'll be out of here by July 
Won't you kiss my kids on Christmas day 

Pleeeease don't let them cry for me 
 
I guess the brothers are driving down from Queensland and Stella's 
flying in from the coast 
They say it's gonna be a hundred degrees, even more maybe, but that 
won't stop the roast 
 
Who's gonna make the gravy now?  
I bet it won't taste the same 
 
Just add flour, salt, a little red wine and don't forget a dollop of 
tomato sauce for sweetness and that extra tang 
 
And give my love to Angus and to Frank and Dolly, 
Tell 'em all I'm sorry I screwed up this time 
And look after Rita, I'll be thinking of her early Christmas morning 
When I'm standing in line 
    
I hear Mary's got a new boyfriend, I hope he can hold his own 
Do you remember the last one? What was his name again? 
(Just a little too much cologne) 
 
And Roger, you know I'm even gonna miss Roger 
'Cause there's sure as hell no one in here I want to fight 
 
Oh praise the Baby Jesus, have a Merry Christmas, 
I'm really gonna miss it, all the treasure and the trash 
And later in the evening, I can just imagine, 
You'll put on Junior Murvin and push the tables back 
And you'll dance with Rita, I know you really like her, 
Just don't hold her too close, oh brother please don't stab me in the 
back 
 
I didn't mean to say that, it's just my mind it plays up, 
Multiplies each matter, turns imagination into fact 
You know I love her badly, she's the one to save me, 
I'm gonna make some gravy, I'm gonna taste the fat 
Tell her that I'm sorry, yeah I love her badly, tell 'em all I'm 
sorry, 
And kiss the sleepy children for me 
You know one of these days, I'll be making gravy, 
I'll be making plenty, I'm gonna pay 'em all back.
There's a girl I know
I want to take her around the world
But she's so unreliable
She's so unreliable

And it would be my luck
She only likes me when she gets drunk
And lately she's been thinking
Of giving up drinking

Come tomorrow
I'll be watching you cry

I only dreamed that I would find
A loving heart, an open mind to see the real me
And I hoped that you would be the one

A chance to talk, a chance to grow
I'll take the risk, let my feelings flow
I've found the words I need to say

Suddenly you're seeing me just the way I am
Suddenly you're hearing me
So I'm talking just as fast as I can to you
Suddenly every part of me needs to know every part of you

Now I know that you are mine
You bring me your love and peace of mind
You see the real me and I know that you're the key

Suddenly you're seeing me just the way I am
Suddenly you're hearing me
So I'm talking just as fast as I can to you
Suddenly every part of me needs to know every part of you

Suddenly you're seeing me just the way I am
Suddenly you're hearing me
So I'm talking just as fast as I can to you

Suddenly, awkwardly
You're all I want, all I need you to be
Suddenly every part of me needs to know every part of you
Just you, it's you
You Sound Like Louis Burdett
Had a little bit to drink
There's a little thing I want at a do out East
Nothing too emotional, my good miss
I couldn't be serious in a room full of jack-knife eyes
Stop talking 'bout the years - you sound like Louis Burdett 

And we roll on to my backshed, play some poker, scratch my head
Look at the sky and spot the planes, where would I go on holidays?
Roll with the punches, down the aisles, and down the street the weeks roll by 

I'm chewing ice and grinning, I'm spewing up and spinning
It's billiousness as usual in my corner of the kitchen
Hey you, lose that friend before we go anywhere
What? Someone might see you alone?
Stop bagging out the band, you sound like Louis Burdett 

All my friends are fuck-ups but they're fun to have around
Banana chairs out on the concrete, telling stories to the stars
how Gemini's love Wooden Dragons, and how down the street the weeks roll by 

The moment the night wears off, the bombsite reappears
They're all asleep but the morning tastes like wine
It tastes like wine in Tempe
I feel so good I just might wake him up
Pat him on the bald head - tell me about a dream Louis, something
obscene Louis, your life's an open magazine Louis 

I'm stoned in a bookshop, sober in a nightclub
Sex is everywhere but nowhere 'round me
By the time she gets to Marrickville we'll be masturbating
never rains in Tempe but the planes remind me of family money and the lack down here
Stop talking frustrated, 'cause I sound like Louis Burdett 

Most of my friends are very fruity indeed, such fun to have around
Terror, like charity, begins at home
Chris don't like madness, but madness likes him
He's got a finger in his chest saying how it should have been

[D.M.C.]
Born to rock around the clock
You can't say I'm not
And in case you forgot
I'm the KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING, of ROCK!!

I'm the devestating mic controller D.M.C.
And can't nobody mess around with me
I'm the king of rock, rap, and a rhyme
I deal what I feel and it feels fine
If the girl's ?? chase then I will play
around with sound put down for the rhymes I say
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together let's rock, HIT IT RUN!

{*beatboxing*}

[D.M.C.]
You, jump, watch you clock, while I rock your spot
I'm better known to the world as the King of Rock
I like to speak my piece when I'm on the mic
I'm the best, or at least, I'm the one you like
And when I serve you deserve to hear what I say
I throw a curve he got the nerve to make a triple play
Now how devestating can an MC be?
My name is Darryl, but you can call me D, HIT IT RUN!

{*beatboxing*}

[D.M.C.]
It's called, gangsta hard rock, non-stop hip-hop
And it's headed for the top by the rhymes I pop
For every race place color country county or creed
and all of the places that I emceed
B-Boy badness to the highest degree
And it can't b-a-boy unless you be D
You can't bust a cherry or crush a grape
and if you ain't got this tape you're in bad shape
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together, let's ROCK!

{*beatboxing*}

[D.M.C.]
Do.. you.. really believe what's going on
I was conceived and I was born
I once was lost but now I'm found
Tell your bunch I'm boss I run this town
I leave all suckers, in the dust
Those dumb motherfuckers can't mess with us
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together, let's rock, HIT IT RUN!

{*beatboxing*}

[D.M.C.]
I.. was.. straight from the start performin art
Climbin up the chart while others fall apart
The three outlaws in the music trade
We won't rob but our job is to get paid
Cause Run has fun if Jay will play
As I add one more rhyme to say
Now how devestating can an MC be?
My name is Darryl, but you can call me D, HIT IT RUN!

{*beatboxing*}

[D.M.C.]
I was born
son of Byford, brother of AL
Bad as my mamma and Run's my pal
It's McDaniels, not McDonald's
These rhymes are Darryl's, the burgers are RONALD'S
I ran down, my family tree
My mother, my father, my brother and D
Run-D.M.C. and JAM MASTER JAY

Got guitars I have never played
Every Elvis album ever made
Got the cars that I should learn to drive
Could have a house that would blow your mind
You can take what I got cause I don’t got nothing
Worth havin I if I ain't got you
You can take what you want cause I don’t want nothing
I’m nothing, if I don’t have you
Yeah
I’ve been to places all around the world
I’ve seen the faces of so many girls
Never thought I would fall in love
And with the songs I write I’m not enough
You can have what I got cause I don’t got nothing worth havin
If I ain’t got you
You can take what you want cause I don’t want nothing
I’m nothing if I don’t have you
I could say but I’m nothing if I don’t have you
You can have what I got cause I don’t got nothing worth havin
If I ain’t got you
Just send me away
Don’t need my sorrow
If I’m broke, I’ll borrow
Just send me a smile
As long as your here by my side
Take what you want baby
Ain’t got nothing ain't got nothing but you now
Take what you want baby
Ain’t got nothing, I ain’t got nothing
You can take what I got cause I don’t got nothing worth having
If I ain’t got you

My life is a valuable thing
I wan't to keep it that way, I won't cry
My life's such a valuable thing
Some things don't fade away, I don't mind
We give the best we can give
We won't forget, we can't forgive
Keep us radioactive free
Strike a bell in Hiroshima park
You know that we can't see in the dark
We try and we try and we try...

Who waits for the planes to come
When everybody's got you on the run
South Pacific carry on

It seems to me that what we're saying
Nobody really wants to talk about it
This is no time to be wondering why
I do the best I can do
The human jungle and the global zoo
I'll find my way it's a very special way

Why wait for the planes to come
When everybody's got us on the run
South Pacific carry on
Here come the Hercules
Here come the submarines
Sinking South Pacific dreams
It's twelve o'clock and it's a wonderful day
I know you hate me but I'll ask anyway
Won't you come with me to a place in a little town
The only way to get there's to go straight down
There's no bathroom, and there is no sink
The water out of the tap is very hard to drink
Very hard to drink

You wait till tomorrow
You wait till tomorrow

You say that money isn't everything
Well I'd like to see you live without it
You think you can keep on going living like a king
Oooh babe, but I strongly doubt it

Very hard to drink
Very hard to drink

You're gonna wait till, fat boy
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow
You're gonna wait till, fat boy
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow

You wait till tomorrow
You wait till tomorrow

You're gonna wait till, fat boy
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow
You're gonna wait till, fat boy
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow
Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind
Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind

I'm so happy for you baby
Now that you've found somebody new
I see it in your eyes
Lord, it's no surprise
What he can do for you

But when I look back baby
When I look back to what we had
And I know I'm countin' good times
But there were just as many bad

And so I wish you
Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind
Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind

There's a lesson here to learn
When your baby ups and leaves you
Carry on, don't feel concerned
Even though you're so much in love
You need a little help from above, oh

Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind
Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind

Oh, ain't no foolin' with you baby
Only the words are hard to find
You got me tremblin' at the knees
Answer won't you please
Before I lose my mind

This is our fifth year, baby
And it feels like I'm in jail, Lord
I'm holding on to this card
Can't seem to get it in the mail
And the card reads

Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind
Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind

Ooh yeah, happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind
Ah yeah, happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind

Oh, have a happy anniversary
'Cause I've got you on my mind
Always on my mind

Happy anniversary
Happy anniversary

Den I sing-a da rest and den at de end we can all-a sing:
Ah, Shaddap-a you face!
0.k., let's-a try it, really big -
Uno duo tre quatro!

What's - a matter you ? Hey !...

If I could gove you life I would take the chance
To make you see how much
All peeps and forgotton plans, Last one to feel your touch
And I watched you from the shadows, Waiting for your coach
And they pushed right past in barrows

I'll bleed you dry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you dry. Get your daughter high
Make your mother cry , I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you dry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you, I'll bleed you, I'll bleed you dry

Heard the click felt the air and the guns go bang
Forced agenocide, but the place and the time was sad
Filled with forgotton lies

And I watched you from the shadows
Pull over by my side

I was shot by a poison arrow

I'll bleed you dry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you dry. Get your daughter high
Make your mother cry , I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you dry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you, I'll bleed you, I'll bleed you dry

And though it never made you happy , you're not dead
And all the people would like to show, your found dead
As if gold ever made you happy

I'll bleed you dry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you dry. Get your daughter high
Make your mother cry , I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you dry, I'll bleed you dry
I'll bleed you, I'll bleed you, I'll bleed you dry
I can't hold out here much longer
The storm won't ever break, those lights won't ever shine
I've been nailed up, shown no mercy
There's a curse upon this land honey
I'm dyin' on the vine
Raise that lantern, keep it bright
Hold it close so I can see
Sleep in tears by yourself tonight
Roll that load over me
I've been sold out, held to ransom
Thrown into the wind so I know which way it blows
I've been locked out, shown no pity
In a faithless town you're gonna reap what you sow
Over you, over me, roll that load over me

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)
I will believe you
If you say it's true
Girl, you know I need you
More than any word spoken
I've seen you before
Turn and walk away
You say you won't come back
It's just a game anyway

We are hoping
Yes, and we're praying

This time will be the last time
That we will fight like this
This time will be the last time
That we will fight like this

We are always wanting
The things we cannot find
You know that we are
Always wasting time

We are hoping
Yes, and we're praying

You know I can forget
We have fought before
I've seen inside your heart
And I know it's breaking

We are hoping
Yeah, and we're praying

This time will be the last time
Oh there once was a swagman camped in a billabong
Under the shade of a coolibah tree
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me

Down came a jumbuck to drink at the billabong
Up got the swaggie and grabbed him with glee
And he sang as he stowed that jumbuck in his tucker-bag
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me
And he sang as he stowed that jumbuck in his tucker-bag
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me

Down came the squatter mounted on his thoroughbred
Up came the troopers one two three
Who’s the jolly jumbuck you’ve got in your tucker-bag?
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me
Who’s the jolly jumbuck you’ve got in your tucker-bag?
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me

Up got the swaggie and jumped into the billabong
You’ll never catch me alive said he
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled
You’ll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me
Monday morning feels so bad
Everybody seems to nag me
Come on Tuesday I feel better
Even my old man looks good
Wednesday just won't go
Thursday goes too slow
I've got Friday on my mind

Gonna have fun in the city
Be with my girl, she's so pretty
She looks fine tonight
She is outa' sight to me

Tonight, I'll paint it red
Tonight, I'll lose my head
Tonight, I've got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind

Do the five day drag once more
No one, nothing else that bugs me
Now I'm working for the rich man
But I'll change his tune one day

Tonight I'll get mad
Tomorrow I'll be glad
'Cause I've got Friday on my mind

Gonna have fun in the city
Be with my girl she's so pretty
She looks fine tonight
She is outa' sight to me

Tonight, I'll paint it red
Tonight, I'll lose my head
Tonight, I've got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind

Yeah

Gonna have fun in the city
Be with my girl she's so pretty
Gonna have fun in the city
Gonna have some fun
Be with my girl she's so pretty
Gonna have some fun

Gonna have fun in the city
Gonna have some fun
Be with my girl she's so pretty
In the city tonight
Gonna have fun in the city

This is my city
This is your city
This is our city now

Well I'm back in the land of second chances
And rock'n'roll shows where nobody dances
Back in the land of chicken and chips
Mars bars and roadside tips

And if you don't like it
Then that's too bad
Cos it's the only city that we've ever had
So when the man says
That you gotta pay
You gotta cancel the cheque and you gotta say...

Well I'm back in the land of cheap incense
Where the favourite sport is sittin' on the fence
Back in the land of pie and sauce
Drinkin' flat beer with no third course

And if you don't like it
Then you gotta fight it
And you gotta fight it now
Ain't no time
For walkin' the line
Somehow the cream's gone sour...

Back in the land of subtle hints
Where the artists are busy painting Picasso prints
Here in the land of all time lows
You can make it big and get your own quiz show
And if you just hate it
Then that's too bad
Cos it's the only city that you've ever had
So when the cop says
Get outa town
You gotta get it together gotta stick around

This is my city
This is your city
This is our city now

I got it
You got it
We got it now

This is my city
This is your city
This is our city now
Macainsh

I rent a flat in Highett, I eat at Hungry Jacks
I was born in the Fifties, on the wrong side of the tracks
I was married but she left me for a plumber from Prahran
Now I see my kids on weekends, I'm a halfway happy man

But when I get my hands on a Kooyong Dollar
I'm gonna be a hard act to follow
I'm gonna rip of this dirty blue collar
When I get my hands on a Kooyong dollar, Kooyong dollar, Kooyong dollar

Well, I'm from the south of South Road, the great artistic void
But I know a great Brett Whitely, Drysdale or Boyd
I love a classic landscape, I know a good red wine
And lately I've been thinkin that the good life should be mine

But when I get my hands on a Kooyong Dollar
I'm gonna be a hard act to follow
That cheap champagne will be real hard to swallow
When I get my hands on a Kooyong dollar, Kooyong dollar, Kooyong dollar

(Ooh, that blue ribbon luck) just grows and grows
(Like honey old money) flows and flows and it flows and flows

But when I get my hands on a Kooyong Dollar
I'm gonna be a hard act to follow
I'm gonna rip of this dirty blue collar
When I get my hands on a Kooyong dollar

I've tried so hard to shake it and lose that convict streak
I'm an A grade mechanic, I get 450 clear a week
Now my Ford dropped a tail shaft on Scotch College Hill
But I know it won't be too long till I get my fingers in the till

(Ooh, that blue ribbon luck) just grows and grows
(Like honey old money) flows and flows and it flows and flows

When I get my hands on a Kooyong Dollar
I'm gonna be a hard act to follow
That cheap champagne will be real hard to swallow
When I get my hands on a ..

When I get my hands on a Kooyong Dollar
I'm gonna be a hard act to follow
That cheap champagne will be real hard to swallow
When I get my hands on a Kooyong dollar, Kooyong dollar, Kooyong dollar
Yodel
Now I've been around Australia and I've travelled everywhere
But there's one place I really like to go
Where the land is big and wide and tall dark ringers ride
On the plains of Peppimenarti, where the old Moyle River flows
Tough riders there of course in a truck or on a horse
And they'll really teach you things you didn't know
It's excitement to the full if you're out there chasing bulls
By the plains of Peppimenarti, where the old Moyle River flows
And the Kangaroo still bounds on that rough and rugged ground
The ant hills and the old pandanas grow
Yes and everyday's a Sunday if you're catching Barramundi
By the plains of Peppimenarti, where the old Moyle River flows
Yodel
(hey, hey hey)
Instrumental
Now the men out on the stock camps are the finest riders known
And they'll work four weeks without a break or spell
They're the back bone of our beef steaks
And I've mentioned this before
And it's a story that I'm always proud to tell
May the march of time never ever bring too many changes
To a way of life you people love and prize
May the years ahead be good ones
And you never lose your customs
With old Peppimenarti Hill looking down so old and wise
And the Kangaroo still bounds on that rough and rugged ground
The ant hills and the old pandanas grow
Yes and everyday's a Sunday if you're catching Barramundi
By the plains of Peppimenarti, where the old Moyle River flows
And the Kangaroo still bounds on that rough and rugged ground
The ant hills and the old pandanas grow
Yes and everyday's a Sunday if you're catching Barramundi
By the plains of Peppimenarti, where the old Moyle River flows Fade
your arms are warm but they make me feel
as if they're made of cold, cold steel
a simple kiss like a turnin' key
a little click and the lock's on me
can't move my arms, can't lift my hands
I won't admit to where I am
but I know baby, I'm in chains, I'm in chains

I pretend I can always leave
free to go whenever I please
but then the sound of my desperate calls
echo off these dungeon walls
I've crossed the line from mad to sane
a thousand times and back again
I love you baby,
I'm in chains, I'm in chains,
I'm in chains, I'm in chains,

should have known passin' through the gate
that once inside I could not escape
I never thought this could happen to me
never thought this is where I'd be
but baby, baby, baby, look at me
I said baby, baby, look at me, I'm in chains

(baby,baby,I'm in cahins)
(baby,baby, I'm in chais)

I never thought this is where I'd be
never thought this would happen to me

(baby,baby,I'm in chains)
(baby,baby,I'm in chains) [go to fade]

By John Williamson

Dingo, Dingo - why you runnin' scared?
Dingo, Dingo - why you runnin' scared?
Guard dog of the mountains
Keepin' the rats from eatin' it all away

Dingo, Dingo - koori warragul
Dingo, Dingo - koori warragul
Guard dog of the plains
Keepin' the sheep from eatin' it all away

Dingo, Dingo - why you get so mad?
Dingo, Dingo - why you get so mad?
Guard dog of the desert
Keepin' the roos from eatin' it all away

And the fields are turning
And the temperature's are rising
I see the factories are burning
When the wheels keep a turning
Well, I've seen that you've grown now
With the horses you ride
Gonna have your say now
See the new moon rising

Oh, she don't mind, she got the time
I see the new moon rising
Oh, she don't mind, she got the time
I see the new moon rising

See the small town boy now
From a small town family
He's got to find his way now
Gotta find himself a woman
Well, he's scared of the people
He don't wanna be the whipping boy
But the time has come now
Gotta hit the highway

Oh, she don't mind, she got the time
I see the new moon rising
Oh, she don't mind, she got the time
I see the new moon rising
I see the new moon rising
I see the new moon rising

See the new moon rising
When the tides are turning
She got the look of the knowing
She got the feelings to showing
With all that love now
I see the fear returning
I see the new moon rising
I see the new moon rising

Oh, she don't mind, she got the time
I see the new moon rising
Oh, she don't mind, she got the time
I see the new moon rising
Breathing from a hole in my lung
I had no one
But faces in front of me
Racing through the void in my head
To find traces of a good luck academy

Sparks ignite and trade them for thought
About no one
And nothing in particular
Washed the sickened socket and drove
Resent nothing
There’s good will inside of me

Wake me up lower the fever
Walking in a straight line
Set me on fire in the evening
Everything will be fine
Waking up strong in the morning
Walking in a straight line
Lately I’m a desperate believer
But walking in a straight line

Something I will never forget
I felt desperate
And stuck to the marrow  
Invisible to everyone else
I’m a sex change
And a damsel with no heroine

Wake me up lower the fever
Walking in a straight line
Set me on fire in the evening
Everything will be fine
Waking up strong in the morning
Walking in a straight line
Lately I’m a desperate believer
But walking in a straight line

I don’t need no time to say
There’s no changing yesterday
If we keep talking and
I keep walking in straight lines

Wake me up lower the fever
Walking in a straight line
Set me on fire in the evening
Everything will be fine
Waking up strong in the morning
Walking in a straight line
Lately I’m a desperate believer
But walking in a straight line

In my life I've many strong desires
And still in all I'm reaching for the fire
You never look, you never see
You never notice when you're next to me
But feel my heart, it's burning with desire

There's a beat for you in my heart
I tell you true from the start

Catch a glimpse, remember it forever
And still I try to keep myself together
You never speak, you never hear
You're never closer when I want you near
But feel my heart, it's burning with desire

There's a beat for you in my heart
I tell you true from the start

Catch a glimpse, remember it forever
And stil lI try to keep myself together
You never look, you never see
You never notice when you're next to me
But feel my heart, it's burning with desire

There's a beat for you in my heart
I tell you true from the start
Havin' a barbie by the river
With no one else around
A tropical honeymoon
Knocking a Four X down
She was standing in the water
Eating a pumpkin scone
When crunch! she was gone

They were doing the crocodile roll
The woman and the reptile
Doing the crocodile roll
In the middle of the river

Down came her husband
With a gun and a carving knife
To slaughter every crocodile
For taking his darling wife

You can't go round eating Queens landers
You overgrown goannas
I'll turn you all into shoes
Crunch!

It was in the news
They were doin the crocodile roll
The husband and the reptile
Doin the crocodile roll
In the middle of the river

Down came his bloodhound
With mangy curly hair
Picked up the scent
Away he went
Bum in the air
Then the dog got carried away
And ran out on a log
When church! no more dog

They were doing the crocodile roll
The canine and the reptile
Doing the crocodile roll
In the middle of the river

Down came a wild pig
Rooting all about
The little swine
Drank the wine
And really pigged it out
Then the crocodile chased him round
And the little pig said "up yours!"
Crunch! into another crocs jaws

They were doing the crocodile roll
The porker and the reptile
Doing the crocodile roll
In the middle of the river

There's no moral to the story
Just a brand new dance
Grab your partner by the neck
And swing your crocodile pants
Dip your toe in the water
Are you ready for romance?
Swirl your tail around the floor
C'mon take a chance

Now your doing the crocodile roll
Stirring up the mud
Doing the crocodile roll
In the middle of the river

They were doing the crocodile roll
Stirring up the mud crabs
Doing the crocodile roll
In the middle of the river

Crunch!

You better stop, better run away
You better listen to what I have to say
I'll keep you hang'in on the line
With just one kiss i willl blow your mind

Your desperation makes you feel insane
Fever running high you will never be the same

Don't you treat me bad
Don't you make me sad
Our love could be deep as the ocean
If you can't be true I got news for you
Just remember I can be poison

Some people say that I'm hard to tame
They know that trouble is my middle name
Too dangerous what you want from me
This chemistry in my body

I've got you scared and now you're running blind
Don't make me mad cause you know I won't be kind oh so kind

Dont give me empty reasons
Cause I don't want your lies
Don't think you can deceive
This poison deep inside

Bless this wine and curse your load
It gets dark on that stretch of road
Stay awhile, come on in from the cold
Raise your cup and kiss the beast
Join me now in a poor man's feast
Stick around, we'll spend a little traitor's gold
Pour a shot of sympathy
We ain't exactly strangers
We might tell it differently
But the story never changes
Lift your eyes don't hide your face
Ain't no crime to fall from grace
Take your time don't shiver out in the rain

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)
I know your face, I've seen it before
A faded memory, a voice through the door
Tell me your name - are you friend or foe?
A star-crossed lover with nowhere to go

True believer you're an open book
The stalls are empty everywhere you look
So long to a night well spent
You can't remember where the money all went

You only did it for the good times
One of the true believers
I know the pleasure that you live for
Must be the last of the self-deceivers

Let's go dancing in our Sunday clothes
Let's raise a glass to the life we chose
Can't believe after all these years
You're still laughing - it brings me to tears

Sinking slowly - the champagne flowed
I was a child up until you showed
Don't be ashamed - let there be no regrets
For the nights of madness we can't forget

You only did it for the good times
One of the true believers
I know the pleasure that you live for
Must be the last of the self-deceivers

Tell me your name - I'll keep you in mind
A true heart is the hardest to find
I know your face - I've seen it before
A faded memory at the nightclub door

You only did it for the good times
One of the true believers
I know the pleasure that you live for
Must be the last of the self-deceivers

You only did it for the good times
One of the true believers
I know the pleasure that you live for
Must be the last of the self-deceivers

You're so! Mgh! (So, so, so, so) Yeah, you look weird man!

We knew when we began, it wouldn’t last forever
But we always thought, somehow it would get better.
There should be love and affection, not rejection,
Love is the key I’m sure, to open every door.
But when love goes away, there’s no foundation,
And no foundation of love means everything is loose above
Just another crazy scene, just another nightmare dream,

And it all falls down like a house of cards
And it all falls down like a house of cards

So stop those angry words, they don’t prove a thing.
Just look around, and see the mess we’re in
Every single day, you know I need you
I need the kind of love I can believe in
But when love goes astray, there’s no foundation
And no foundation of love means everything is loose above
Just another crazy scene, just another nightmare dream

When it all falls down like a House of Cards.
And it all falls down like a House of Cards in the wind
It all falls down like a House of Cards falls down.

So stop! those angry words, they don’t prove a thing.
Just look around, and see the mess we’re in
Every single day, you know I need you
I need the kind of love I can believe in
But when love goes astray, there’s no foundation
And no foundation of love means everything is loose above
Just another crazy scene, just another nightmare dream

It all falls down like a House of Cards
Yeah it all falls down like a House of Cards in the wind
It all falls down like a House of Cards etc.

Sadie, the cleaning lady
With trusty scrubing brush and pale of water
Worked her fingers to the bone
For the life she had at home
Providing at the same for her daughter

Oh Sadie, the cleaning lady
Her aching knee's not getting any younger
Well her red detergent hands
Have for years not held a mans
And time would find her hard in spite of hunger

Scrub your floors, do your chores
Dear old Sadie
Looks as though you'll always be a cleaning lady
Can't afford to get board
Dear old Sadie
Looks as though you'll always be a cleaning lady

Oh Sadie, the cleaning lady
Her female mind would find a way of trapping
Though as gentle as a lamb
Sam the elevator man
So she could spend the night by tv napping

Oh Sadie, the cleaning lady
Her aching knee's not getting any younger
Well her red detergent hands
Have for years not held a mans
And time would find her hard in spite of hunger

Scrub your floors, do your chores
Dear old Sadie
Looks as though you'll always be a cleaning lady
Can't afford to get board
Dear old Sadie
Looks as though you'll always be a cleaning lady

Oh Sadie, the cleaning lady
Her Sam was what she got for crying and singing
To her solo and dismay
She's still working 'till this day
Her sam then that to be another singer

Scrub your floors, do your chores
Dear old Sadie
Looks as though you'll always be a cleaning lady
Buy a litre of Fabulon
Dare we spray down
In the scorched trail
Of a Sunbream iron

Paint your face with Revlon
To hide your frown
In the blue gloam glare
Of your Rank Television

Carry it away from Myers now
Requiring of us a lon
How can we live without these things
In Templestowe

Buy an electric toothbrush for your mouth
Roche medication for your heart
You'll be comfortable locked uptight
In your sauna

Let the third world rabble on
If dishwasher breaks down
An eyeful of Visine
A floral tissue to cry on

In the valley of Silicon
Where we may drown
And there we leapt
Into blind oblivion

Carry it away from Tandy now
A computer of your own
How can we live without a VDU
And a life programme

A bottle of Listerine for your mouth
A pair of Adidas for your heard
You'll be comfortable locked uptight
In your wardrobe

Buy a litre of Fabulon
Dare we spray down
In the scorched trail
Of a Sunbream iron
Had a scratch only you could itch
Underneath the Glebe Point Bridge
And now every boy in a knitted vest
Has got some precedent
So we took a personality pill
And something red to swill
And now every fire has gone out
in every heart that wanted to kill
Let's call it a day
Every thought that once had a sound
We'll have to hide 'til no one is around
'cause there ain't no room in the city today
For explanations that you just can't say
Found out what shame can mean
In purple sneakers and grey jeans
And every walked to a school that once made sense
Sure felt like an accident
Let's call it a day

For every trouble you found
There's a drink to lose it and drown
But do you need somebody, to feel somebody?

Every day that once had a sound
We'll have to hide 'til no one is in town
I don't hate I just feel better
When no one else is around
So we'll take a personality pill
And something red to swill
And now every fire has gone out
in every heart that wanted to kill
Let's call it a day

For every trouble you found
There's a drink to lose it and drown
But do you need somebody, to feel somebody?

You can shave a million ways
To make damn sure that the twelve in you stays
But do you need somebody, to feel somebody?

See the sound
It crashes in
All around
It gets in
Now take your hands
And raise them up
Into to the air
That's all around ya 
Now bring them down
Like a clock at two
Shake your head
You know what to do
They want to put
Guns in the sky
Someone out there
Ain't gonna like it 

But it could be good
Make us love each other
Have to realize
I own the future 

Guns in the sky 

Guns in the sky 

Guns in the sky 

Guns in the sky 

Guns in the sky
Child grows up to see
Guns in the sky
Used to be on TV 

Want to change
Forgot the joke
It's great to see you
I'm running late, da da da
Love your hair, da da da
Lend me a ten, da da da
I love your big house, da da da

Could you spare a dime
Well I'm sick of it, it's a load of shit
We could stop the world and let of all the fools
And let them go live with their guns in the sky

Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky
Qantas flight 20, Denpasar, meals and accom', rent-a-car
I've been to Bali, I've been to Bali too

Took a two week course at a suntan clinic
So lying round Legian I wouldn't look anaemic
And you can't impress me, 'cause I've been to Bali too

Got a ride out to Kuta in the back of a truck
Cost me twenty dollars and it wasn't worth a buck
Hustled to a losman down Poppies Lane
By a Javanese guy in a tropical rainstorm
Lock up your daughters, I've been to Bali too

Life is tragic hanging out at Kuta
If you haven't got a car, a bike or a scooter
Show me the bike shop, I've been to Bali too

Got myself a Honda, had to get away
No brakes, bald tyres, five thousand rupes a day
I've been to Bali too

Well I don't ride a bike much home in Australia
As a motorcycle hero guess I'm a failure
Bemos to the left, trucks to the right
The Honda was a wreck but I was alright
Hello mecurochrome, I've been to Bali too

Wired home for money, short of cash
A dose of Bali belly and a tropical rash
Daddy came through - American Express
Bali t-shirts, magic mushrooms, Redgum bootlegs
I've been to Bali too

Took my bag and mozzie coils to Peliatan
It's there were my Bali trip really began
Been there, done that, I've been to Bali too

Tourists from Holland, Britain and France
Late night puppet shows, leg on dance
Want to see my slides, I've been to Bali too

Well I wandered off to Ubud, just a little up the track
One week there didn't want to come back
Listening to Gamelon playing guitar
Janteris, tacos, Hotel Monara, two month visa
I've been to Bali too

Flying kangaroo out of Denpasar-
Left me camera in the airport bar:
I’ve been to Bali, I’ve been to Bali too
Touch down, touch down Tullamarine
They sprayed me on the plane so I’d be real clean
Coming through customs
I’ve been to Bali too

They went through my bags like
McCartney in Japan
I didn’t have a thing
So I didn’t give a damn:
You can’t trick me
‘Cause I’ve been to Bali too

You’ve been to Paris and you’ve been to Boston
You’ve been to Fiji and You’ve been to London
But you can’t impress me
‘Cause I’ve been to Bali too
Albert goes west, he crossed the vast indifferent deserts of Arizona, oh yeah
He had a psychotic episode on a dude ranch that involved a bottle of ammonia
Henry, he went south and lost his way deep in the weeping forests of Le Vulva
He grew so wan, he grew so sick, he ended up in a bungalow sucking a revolver

The light upon your rainy streets offers many reflections
I won't be hold responsible for my actions

Bobby, he goes north, then goes east, then over to New Hampshire
Bobby is a cautious man, he walked into a Concord dive to drink a beer

Mhm

Do you wanna dance? 
Do you wanna move?
Do you wanna dance? 
Do you wanna groove?

I said the world is full of endless abstractions
And I won't be held responsible for my actions

Me, I ain't going anywhere, just sit and watch the sun come up, I like it here
I watch the people go ticking past, go hey hey hey, you know I gotta say I like it here

All right

Sha la-la-la, sha la-la-la, sha la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la, sha la-la-la, sha la-la-la-la-la-la

Well, if you're the travelling type
And you wanna visit the emergency room
Cause I mean you're gonna need stitches
Cause I'm gonna gonna build you up...
Just to break you in two

You think you got a hold on this...
I think you should get a hold of a nurse
For this heart attack

The fondest memory you'll have's a picture of my back
On my schedule, I'm behind, so quit takin' up my time
Oh yeah, plenty more to crack
Tell all your sisters and her friends
Publicize my crime so I can spread illness, this heart attack

I think you thought we were in love
My love you love has had enough
Go on, pop your pills while I lie to you, oh
Watch your back, heart attack!

Every kiss was a stab and your lips let down their guard
You were holding up two hearts with a joker and continued the game
Why is love so hard?
Oh shut your mouth, you always talked too much
Save it for that moment when you're fallin' and you can't get up
From this heart attack
Hold that chrysalis in your palm
See it split and change
It won't do you any harm
It's just trying to rearrange
It was born to live a day
Now it flies up from your hand
It's beautiful
It's the one they call
Your ever-loving man

Wolves have carried your babies away
O your kids drip from their teeth
The nights are long and the day
Is bitter cold beyond belief
You spread yourself like a penitent
On the mad vibrating sand
And through your teeth
Arrange to meet
Your midnight man

Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around!
O baby don't you see
Everybody wants to be
Your midnight man

Don't disturb me as I sleep
Treat me gentle when I wake
And don't disturb me as I sleep
Even though your body aches

Even though your body aches
To serve at his command
Between the walls
She still adores
Her ever-loving man

Close your eyes, sleep in him
Dream of your lost sons and daughters
Me, I'll raise up the dorsal fin
And glide up and down the waters

I'll glide up and down the waters
Then I'll walk upon the land
And call 'em out
The ones who doubt
Your midnight man

Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around!
Don't did you see
Everybody wanna to be
Your midnight man

It's early in the morning
And I don't know what to do
It's early in the morning
And I can't believe its true
As I lay in the moment
And it's happening again
Well, I called you once, I called you twice
Ain't I your midnight man

Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around!
They want you, they love you, they need you
To be, your midnight man

Everybody's coming here
Everybody's coming here
Everybody's coming here
To be your midnight man
To be your midnight man
Little cloud is searching
For a sign of something stirring
In the hearts of those below and they all sleep
Civic pride and order
To raise a son and daughter
Staked out and all made clear who got here first

Ah honey can I hold you
And play rewind in my head?
I don't know my people anymore
Can I stay with you instead?
Picture a little boy lying under his bed
His brother's playing outside in the dirt
And the fence it shimmers in the heat
Like it wants to disappear

Little cloud is creeping
Across the city sleeping
Who below would try and wake from a bad dream?

I woke early, what did I see
But a clear sky, a clear sky
Looked out my window and what did I see
But a clear sky in paradise
Picture his momma, little girl on her knee
Following a piece of shade under a tree
And the fence it shimmers in the heat
Like it wants to disappear
He's better looking than he looks
His music is better than it sounds
When he won't speak
Still waters run deep
All of this is true
When you're as pretty as you

Yeah anything is true
When you're as pretty as you

He likes the same bands as you
It's getting stranger but it's true
Didn't you see him up the front
When they were starting out?

He had a picture of you
In his head before you met
And all of this is true
When you're as pretty as you

Yeah anything is true
When you're as pretty as you

But when you get a look at his life it's too late
Yeah when you get a look at his life it's too late

Ah the evening leans forward
On the edge of its seat
'Cause you're laughing with him
Yeah you're nearly in bed

He's better looking than he looks
My music is better than it sounds
All of this is true
When you're as pretty as you

Yeah anything is true
When you're as pretty as you

I left my heart to the sappers round Khe Sanh
And I sold my soul with my cigarettes to the blackmarket man
I've had the Vietnam cold turkey
From the ocean to the Silver City
And it's only other vets could understand

About the long forgotten dockside guarantees
How there were no V-dayheroes in 1973
And how we sailed into Sydney Harbour
Saw an old friend but couldn't kiss her
She was lined, and I was home to the lucky land

And she was like so many more from that time on
Their lives were all so empty, until they found their chosen one
And their legs were often open
But their minds were always closed
And their hearts were held in fast suburban chains
And the legal pads were yellow, hours long, paypacket lean
And the telex writers clattered where the gunships once had been
And car parks make me jumpy
And I never stopped the dreams
Or the growing need for speed and novacaine

So I worked across the country from end to end
Tried to find a place to settle down, where my mixed up life could mend
Held a job on an oil-rig
Flying choppers when I could
But the nightlife nearly drove me round the bend

And I've travelled round the world from year to year
And each one found me aimless, one more year the worst for wear
And I've been back to South East Asia
You know the answer sure ain't there
But I'm drifting north, to check things out again

Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
Only seven flying hours, and I'll be landing in Hong Kong
And there ain't nothing like the kisses
From a jaded Chinese princess
I'm gonna hit some Hong Kong mattress all night long

Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
And it's really got me worried
I'm goin' nowhere and I'm in a hurry
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone

Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone (yeah, yeah)
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
And it's really got me worried
I'm goin' nowhere and I'm in a hurry
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone

I don't go to parties baby
'Cause people tend to freak me out
Watch their lips to work it out
I can hear the words but I still don't know what it's all about

You won't see me down the disco mama
Bright lights really hurt my eyes
I'd rather stay and dance with you
To the funky music playing on our stereo

Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me
Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me

I don't go to concerts baby
The music's always up too loud
Cigarettes and alcohol get up my ass
I always lose you in the crowd

You won't see me tribal raving baby
'Cause I won't ever look that good
I'd rather dance in ugly pants
In the comfort of a loungeroom in suburbia

Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me
Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me

That's right

Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me
Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me

That's right

Better than you and me
Better than you and me

Thank you Mr. DJ

Well let me tell you a story of Hungry Town
Where the men love men and women kiss the ground
I got my hat and a dollar bill
Lord I feel so hungry I'm feeling ill

Well Hungry Town people got nothin to eat
They're scratching the dirt trying to plant the seed
When night time comes it's time for bed
Well now I gotta fight just to lay my head

Well it's a Hungry Town
Where people kiss the ground
And the higher you go
That's where the feeling grows
There's a world out there
Where people just don't care
About what's going down
Right here in Hungry Town

Something's frying
On the floor below
I'm leaning out
My window
The sky's on fire
The street's all aglow
And somebody's singing
To the radio

I would jump from the sixteenth floor
If I only could get next to you
Put my head in a lion's jaw
If I only could get next to you

I'm walking the floor
I'm climbing the walls
I wake up from dreaming
That's when I fall

Take a ride on a wrecking ball, yes I would, darling...

[Hook 1]
Every day I speak your name
If I had wings I'd fly
Cause you're not here to hold me

I would jump from the sixteenth floor (sixteenth floor)
Put my head in a lion's jaw (lion's jaw)
I'd walk on burning coals (burning coals)
I'd sell my only soul (only soul), yes I would

[Hook 2]
Every day I speak your name

I'd walk on burning coal (burning coal)
I'd sell my only soul (only soul)
I would jump from the sixteenth floor (sixteenth floor)
Put my head in a lion's jaw (lion's jaw)

Take a ride on Niagara Falls (Niagara Falls)
Over broken glass I would crawl (I would crawl)
I'd walk on burning coals (burning coals)...
Too many poeple need a pseudonym
Cut their hair and pout like anything
So worried that the real them might get in
And paranoid about their skin
They usually have good fashion sense
So aware that red and green offends
Most have a popstar for a friend
Or live of what their parents send

Can I be sure when I don't know
Who I am talking to anymore

They so adament in their belief
Sincere dedicated and cheap
Maintain they've never needed to enfeoff
Or justify to their relief
But then it barely lasts an episode
From verse to verse without a pallnode
Into the next issue of mode
Spectacled and pidgeon toed

With well established social prejudice
Become second rate rock journalists
Never satisfy the need to outwit
And influence the modernist
Too many people need a pseudonym
Cut their hair and pout like anything
So afraid the real them might get in
Concern and always rivalling

They call me The Wild Rose 
But my name was Elisa Day 
Why they call me it I do not know 
For my name was Elisa Day 

From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one 
As she stared in my eyes and smiled 
For her lips were the colour of the roses 
They grew down the river, all bloody and wild 

When he knocked on my door and entered the room 
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace 
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand 
He wiped the tears that ran down my face 

On the second day I brought her a flower 
She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen 
I said, 'Do you know where the wild roses grow 
So sweet and scarlet and free?' 

On the second day he came with a single rose 
Said: 'Will you give me your loss and your sorrow?' 
I nodded my head, as I laid on the bed 
He said, 'If I show you the roses will you follow?' 

On the third day he took me to the river 
He showed me the roses and we kissed 
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word 
As he stood smiling above me with a rock in his fist 

On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow 
And she lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief 
As I kissed her goodbye, I said, 'All beauty must die' 
And lent down and planted a rose between her teeth

It's up in the morning and on the downs
Little white clouds like gambolling lambs
And I am breathless over you
And the red-breasted robin beats his wings
His throat it trembles when he sings
For he is helpless before you
The happy hooded bluebells bow
And bend their heads all a-down
Heavied by the early morning dew
At the whispering stream, at the bubbling brook
The fishes leap up to take a look
For they are breathless over you
Still your hands
And still your heart
For still your face comes shining through
And all the morning glows anew
Still your mind
Still your soul
For still, the fare of love is true
And I am breathless without you
The wind circles among the trees
And it bangs about the new-made leaves
For it is breathless without you
The fox chases the rabbit round
The rabbit hides beneath the ground
For he is defenceless without you
The sky of daytime dies away
And all the earthly things they stop to play
For we are all breathless without you
I listen to my juddering bones
The blood in my veins and the wind in my lungs
And I am breathless without you
Still your hands
And still your heart
For still your face comes shining through
And all the morning glows anew
Still your soul
Still your mind
Still, the fire of love is true
And I am breathless without you
Well all my friends are getting married
Yes they're all growin' old
They're staying home on weekends
They're all doin' what they're told
But I'm caught up in this magic
I'm all caught up in the fun
I'm all caught up in this music
Maybe I'll never have a son

Well I looked into the crowd the other night
And I saw an old familiar face
He said "How are you doin' Shirl my boy?"
He said " Tell me, are you still playin' the same old place
I asked him all about himself
And he said that he was married with a kid
Showed me a picture of his wife
And we talked about all the things we did

Well sometimes I feel like I'm left behind
And sometimes I feel like I just left school
Wonder if I'll ever grow up
Maybe I'm the only fool

But I'm all caught up in this magic
Yes I'm caught up in this fun

I'm all caught up with this music
Well maybe I'll never have a son
I'm standing here on the ground
The sky above won't fall down
See no evil in all direction
Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark
For too long 

Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me

I found a love that I had lost
It was gone for too long
Hear no evil in all directions
Execution of bitterness
Message received loud and clear 

Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me 
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me 

I'm standing here on the ground
The sky above won't fall down
See no evil in all direction
Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark
For too long 

Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me 
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me 
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me 

Four letter word, four letter word
Four letter word, four letter word

You make me wanna sing to you, ah oh
Yeah, it's the little things you do for me, homie, lover, friend
I can spend my life with you, ah oh
Yeah girl, we ain't gotta thing to lose so, let's go and runaway

It's you and me, never gotta worry
'Cause we always got each other
Like the moon to the sea
Girl, you got me feeling your way

You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter
You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word

Four letter, four letter word you can be anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
'Cause you're my four letter word, four letter word
And I'm your four letter word, whoa

To be loved, to be loved, what a feeling, it's a drug
I'ma addicted to ya hugs and ya kisses and ya ah
No matter who's around I show affection
Walk you on the inside of the sidewalk for protection

I need a moment to take it all in, feel so surreal, don't it
When you need me call me, I will never leave you lonely
And I think that's it corny to just call you my angel
You're my Aaliyah, this letter is almost four pages

See my parents and your parents don't agree
They think our love is temporary 'cause we only teens
But not too many get it right on the first try
And I'm feeling so right for the first time

You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word
You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word

Four letter, four letter word, you can be anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
'Cause you're my four letter word, four letter word
And I'm your four letter word, whoa

I don't wanna hear a love song 'cause I live it
Every moments memorable we'll never forget it
Love the way you pucker up your lips when I peck it
When you get this message I'll be right here when you check it

My heart, my mind, my soul, my time
It's all for you, let me say it one more time
My heart, my mind, my soul, my time
It's all for you underscore bottom line

You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word
You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word

You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word
You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word
Love, you're my four letter word, love
What is it you want from me?
There isn't much I will not do
If it's only company
You know, I might need that too
Won't you?

Come anytime
I'm a man of leisure
Come anytime
I await your pleasure

There's nothing new beneath the sun
We've butchered every sacred cow
Don't tell me about all the things you might have done
Just tell me what are you doing now right now

Come anytime
I won't give you pressure
Come anytime
I can wait forever
And if you can't make up your mind
We could make it up together

Things like this happen every day
Whatever happens
It's O.K
Why be afraid when we've got it made
I'll never ask you to explain

What is it you want from me?
You won't shock me easily
Maybe it's your heart's desire
Maybe it's your wildest dream
Maybe I'm a gun-for-hire
But baby, don't we make quite a team, don't we?
Don't we?

Come anytime
(You're so inclined)
I won't give you trouble
Come anytime (you're going blind)
Or you're seeing double
And I have never been the kind
Who'd want to burst your bubble
Come anytime
Many a time the thought crossed my mind
Wonderin' 'bout people who walk around blind
They don't seem to see the light of day
Everything is just okay

Taking no heed of what they can learn
Running in circles, no point of return
Heading for the door that reads escape
Anything that they can take

Hey boys, come out and dig the dance
Come on and take a chance
Believe in the light of day

Lonesome nights and wasted days
Leads a man from his true ways
Yet he tells you he's nobody's fool
Breaking every golden rule

Hey boys, come out and dig the dance
Come on and take a chance, believe in the light of day

Keep a watch on the sandman of time
Will he gaze into your eyes or mine
Will he knock on your door
And invite you to the other side
Catch him writing the score
As he takes you for another ride
Hang on tight boy, you're starting to slide...

Hey boys, come out and dig the dance
Come on and take a chance
Believe in the light of day
Believe in the light of day
Despair and Deception, Love's ugly little twins
Came a-knocking on my door, I let them in
Darling, you're the punishment for all my former sins

I let love in

The door it opened just a crack, but love was shrewd and bold
My life flashed before my eyes, it was a horror to behold
A life-sentence sweeping confetti from the floor of a concrete hole

I let love in

Well, I've been bound and gagged and I've been terrorized
And I've been castrated and I've been lobotomized
But never has my tormentor come in such a cunning disguise

I let love in

O Lord, tell me what I done
Please don't leave me here on my own
Where are my friends?
My friends are gone

So if you're sitting all alone and hear a-knocking at your door
And the air is full of promises, well buddy, you've been warned
Far worse to be Love's lover than the lover that Love has scorned

I let love in

Girls on the avenue, they're trying to get you in
Strolling by with their rosebud smiles
They're all dressed up to kill, lean on the windowsill
Looking your way with eyes of fire;
But don't you slip - don't you slip
In love with the girls on the avenue;
Friday night see the girls on the avenue
Like a child at big store windows you feel confused
So many girls on the avenue
Girls on the avenue, know how to get you in
Casting out sighs like tricks from a hat
All the Miss Lonely Hearts, oh they look awful hard
Then sometimes they seem as fragile as glass;
But don't you slip - don't you slip
In love with the girls on the avenue;
Friday night see the girls on the avenue
Like a child at big store windows you feel confused
So many girls on the avenue
Aaah
Aaah
But don't you slip - don't you slip
In love with the girls on the avenue;
Friday night see the girls on the avenue
Like a child at big store windows you feel confused
So many girls on the avenue
Don't you slip - don't you slip
In love with the girls on the avenue
Don't you slip - hey boys don't you slip
In love with the girls on the avenue
Don't you slip - hey boys don't you slip
In love with the girls on the avenue
Don't you slip - hey boys don't you slip
In love with the girls on the avenue
Don't you slip - hey boys don't you slip
In love with the girls on the avenue
(Don't you slip - hey boys don't you slip)
(In love with the girls on the avenue)
My girlfriend lives in the ground
My friends ask why she's not around
She won't come home
I'm so alone, you'll never know
You can't bury love
You've gotta dig it up
Yeah, you've gotta live it up

I take her flowers each day
I place them over her grave
I want her back
Because I look so bad, so bad in black
Like a maniac
You can't bury love
You've gotta dig it up
Yeah, you've gotta live it up

Please, darling, come home to me
Well, I'll make you so happy, you will see
I'll paint your room
In pink and blue, I'll even choose the colour scheme for you
You can't take away my love
I'll never give it up
Yeah, I'm gonna dig it up

(No, you can't make me)
(Don't, don't, don't)
(Don't tell me, I don't want to know)

My girlfriend lives in the ground
My friends, you ask me why is she six feet down
I can't tell you why Œ'cause if I even try
I'd fall down flat on my face
And I'd cry, "you can't take away my love"
I'm gonna dig it up, yeah
I'm gonna live it up, oh
I'm gonna dig it up, dig it up
I'm never gonna stop
Life's like a cup
You've gotta fill it up
Sydney town 1885
Sulphur air and blackened skies
And you live your life in the pocket of a richer man
In the sheds and the docks and down the mines
From the back blocks of Queensland to the Goutre Line
Thanks for the money and they kick the strikers down with guns

We won't drop anchor till we reach Alta Mira sound
Heave away we're new Australia bound
Heave away we're new Australia bound
For virgin ground

In pucky little offices in Adelaide
You count company profits but you're underpaid
There must be more to life than the promise of another day
So collect the tools and pack your bags
The sea is calling hoist a brave new flag
We'll make history in the forests of Paraguay

We won't drop anchor till we reach Altermira sound
Heave away we're new Australia bound
Heave away we're new Australia bound
For virgin ground

Wide eyed romantics and a heartbreak dream
Your motives aren't what they seem
You've got your feet caked in Australian mud
And you can't deny what's in your blood
Under Paraguay skies and the nights so cold
You can forsake your country and lose your soul

You've got to run from your troubles, no need to stand your ground
Heave away we're new Australia bound
We won't drop anchor till we reach Alta Mira sound
Heave away we're new Australia bound
For virgin ground
I'm saying all the things that I know you'll like, makin' good conversation
I gotta handle you just right, you know what I mean
I took you to an intimate restaurant, then to a suggestive movie
There's nothin' left to talk about, unless it's horizontally

Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk

repeat CHORUS

I've been patient, I've been good, tried to keep my hands on the table
It's gettin' hard this holdin' back, you know what I mean
I'm sure you'll understand my point of view, we know each other mentally
You gotta know that you're bringin' out the animal in me

Oh, let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk

Let's get animal, animal, I wanna get animal, let's get into animal
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk

Let me hear your body talk
Let me hear your body talk
i built an aeroplane
it was just like the real ones that i saw when i was younger
but it was too small for me
to crawl inside the cockpit and fly away
at a million miles an hour (x4)
and it took me years
underneath the house we lived in
i threw my head and my heart in the cockpit
the sounds of the engines
the voices from upstairs i only heard my crew
preparing me for take off (x4)
preparing me (x2)
and it's just a model
built with plastic and with glue
but every day i go down to the airport
and i fly away from
i fly away from you (x2)

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And now it's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try, to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking, people
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
We will get low

Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancing man, and I just can't lose
You know it's alright, it's OK
I'll live to see another day
We can try, to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking, people
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

Life’s goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born

And you may look the other way
We can try, to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother

Come around in the morning and I come around at night
Sniff it in the air in the morning light
Here's love and the world we're lost

Learned how to bark and I learned how to bite
And when you start bleeding you talk all night
Here's the place where the scent got lost

Scratched at the gate and I scratched at the ground
My hair stands up when the gate swings round
It's all comin' out into the open and I'm lickin' your hand all over
It's all comin' out into the open and I'm lickin' your hand all over

Come around in the morning and I come around at night
Sniff it in the air in the morning light
Here's love and the world well lost

Learned how to bark and I learned how to bite
And when you start bleeding you talk all night
Here's the place where the scent got lost

Your name is Hazel, the hammer and tongs girl
You got fingers like ginger-roots
Now it's all comin' out into the open and I'm lickin' your hand all over
Now it's all comin' out into the open and I'm lickin' your hand all over

Here is a love and a world, we're lost

Here is a love and a world, we're lost

And it's all coming out in the open

Lickin' your hand all over
Lickin' your hand all over
Lickin' your hand all over
Lickin' your hand all over
From coast to coast by night and day, hear the clickin' of the wheels
The hummin' of the diesel on her ribbons of steel
Carryin' the memories of a nation built by hand
See the Indian Pacific span the land

She's the pride of all the railway men 'cross country where she flies
From the blue Pacific waters to where the mountains rise
By lakes and wide brown rivers, through desert country dry
See the Indian Pacific passin' by

Oh the Indian Pacific she goes rollin' down the track
Five thousand miles to travel before she's there and back

Beside the line, a drover waves his battered old grey hat
And kids are catchin' yabbies down by the river flat
And a woman hangs her washing in a backyard near the line
As the Indian Pacific's rollin' by

Instrumental

Hear the whistle blowin' lonely 'neath the Nullabor star light
Saluting those who walk across the track she romps tonight
Callin' to the railway camp and the fettlers on the line
I'm the Indian Pacific, right on time

From the silver of the Broken Hill to old Kalgoorlie gold
She mirrors all the colours of the land so hard and old
Then the western clouds are blooming and the air is just like wine
And the Indian Pacific's makin' time

Oh the Indian Pacific she goes rollin' down the track
Five thousand miles to travel before she's there and back

From the waters of the western sea to the eastern ocean sand
The Indian Pacific spans the land
Oh the Indian Pacific spans the land
Go son, go down to the water
And see the women weeping there
Then go up into the mountains
The men, they are weeping too

Father, why are all the women weeping?
They are weeping for their men
Then why are all the men there weeping?
They are weeping back at them

This is a weeping song
A song in which to weep
While all the men and women sleep
This is a weeping song
But I won't be weeping long

Father, why are all the children weeping?
They are merely crying son
O, are they merely crying, father?
Yes, true weeping is yet to come

This is a weeping song
A song in which to weep
While all the men and little children sleep
This is a weeping song
But I won't be weeping long

O father tell me, are you weeping?
Your face seems wet to touch
O then I'm so sorry, father
I never thought I hurt you so much

This is a weeping song
A song in which to weep
While we rock ourselves to sleep
This is a weeping song
But I won't be weeping long
But I won't be weeping long
But I won't be weeping long
But I won't be weeping long
I found out that you care for another guy
I found out that you want for another smile
We are alone as two different people can be
And it's hurting me so
Just to know that you don't care for me

The other guy won't be around to talk to our kids
He won't understand when you're down the way that I did
We had it all, you and I, we just need to try again

I found out that your heart's in another guy
You found out that you're tellin' another lie
We've gone apart and goin' our own separate ways
And you don't understand
Why I love you and want you to stay

You don't know it's me that you need
You're thinking of him and I can't compete
Well I'm here to say I still want you back again
Everybody's been caught in the act
Everybody's been caught in the act
Everybody's been caught in the act of love
I find it hard to believe
This has happened to me
I've fallen again and I'm on my knees
I'm baring my soul and it's all for you
That's what I always seem to do
I can see no other way
Than to give you all my love
So I'll take it slow
But before you know it
You've tied up my heart
I'm in chains
I've been caught
In the act of love
I feel so crazy
What can I do
I've been caught
In the act of love
And it's all down to you
I've fallen in love
I've opened my heart and I'll let you in
I should have been patient be sure I'll win
But there's nothing I could ever hide
I may be a fool but it's all for you
I can se no other way
Than to give you
All my love
So I'll take it slow
But before you you know it
You've tied up my heart, I'm in chains
See the chains which bind the men
Can you taste their lonely arrogance
It's always too late and your face is so cold
They struggled for this opulence

See the suns which blind the men
Burnt away so long before our time
Now their warmth is forgotten and gone
Pretty maids not far behind

Who you trying to get in touch with
Who you trying to get in touch with
Who you trying to get in touch with

I'm almost with you
I can sense it wait for me
I'm almost with you
Is this the taste of victory
I'm almost with you

See the dust which fills your sleep
Does it always feel this chill near the end
I never dreamed we'd meet here once more
This laugh reserved for a friend
I've searched the holy books
I tried to unravel the mystery of Jesus Christ, the saviour
I've read the poets and the analysts
Searched through the books on human behaviour
I travelled this world around
For an answer that refused to be found
I don't know why and I don't know how
But she's nobody's baby now

I loved her then and I guess I love her still
Hers is the face I see when a certain mood moves in
She lives in my blood and skin
Her wild feral stare, her dark hair
Her winter lips as cold as stone
Yeah, I was her man
But there are some things love won't allow
I held her hand but I don't hold it now
I don't know why and I don't know how
But she's nobody's baby now

This is her dress that I loved best
With the blue quilted violets across the breast
And these are my many letters
Torn to pieces by her long-fingered hand
I was her cruel-hearted man
And though I've tried to lay her ghost down
She's moving through me, even now
I don't know why and I don't know how
But she's nobody's baby now
She's nobody's baby now
Nobody's baby now
She's nobody's baby now
Travelling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said

"Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover."

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscle
I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said

"I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover."

Lying in a den in Bombay
Slack jaw, not much to say
I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me
Because I come from the land of plenty?"
And he said

"Oh! Do you come from a land down under (oh yeah yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover."

Mail arrives in the morning
I'm hoping for good news
Another letter from a girl that I don't know
Another letter full of no news

You don't tell me anything
You just go on and on
And you don't make no sense

You try to tell me that you love me
But we ain't never met
You try to say you're gonna be my one and only
But I wouldn't take no bet

You don't tell me anything
You just go on and on
And you don't make no sense
Sydney, 1926, this is the story of a man
Just a kid in from the sticks, just a kid with a plan
St George took a gamble, played him in first grade
Pretty soon that young man showed them how to flash the blade
And at the age of nineteen he was playing for the State
From Adelaide to Brisbane the runs did not abate
He hit 'em hard, he hit 'em straight 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

A team came out from England
Wally Hammond wore his felt hat like a chief
All through the summer of '28, '29 they gave the greencaps no relief
Some reputations came to grief
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
And in the hour of greatest slaughter the great avenger is being born
But who then could have seen the shape of things to come
In Bradman's first test he went for eighteen and for one
They dropped him like a gun
Now big Maurice Tate was the trickiest of them all
And a man with a wisecracking habit
But there's one crack that won't stop ringing in his ears
"Hey Whitey, that's my rabbit"
Bradman never forgot it 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

England 1930 and the seed burst into flower
All of Jackson's grace failed him, it was Bradman was the power
He murdered them in Yorkshire,he danced for them in Kent
He laughed at them in Leicestershire, Leeds was an event
Three hundred runs he took and rewrote all the books
That really knocked those gents
The critics could not comprehend hsi nonchalant phenomenon
"Why this man is a machine," they said. "Even his friends say he isn't human"
Even friends have to cut something 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

Summer 1932 and Captain Douglas had a plan
When Larwood bowled to Bradman it was more than man to man
And staid Adelaide nearly boiled over as rage ruled over sense
When Oldfield hit the ground they nearly jumped the fence
Now Bill Woodill was as fine a man as ever went to wicket
And the bruises on his body that day showed that he could stick it
But to this day he's still quoted and only he could wear it
"There's two teams out there today and only one of them's playing cricket." 

He was longer than a memory, bigger than a town
He feet they used to sparkle and he always kept them on the ground
Fathers took their sons who never lost the sound of the roar of the grandstand 

Now shadows they grow longer and there's so mush more yet to be told
But we're not getting any younger, so let the part tell the whole
Now the players all wear colours, the circus is in town
I can no longer go down there, down to that sacred ground 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand
Feed me I got my head interstate
Got my head interstate when I'm alone
Give me a break, I've got to work up to hate
Only get out of bed when I'm alone
Give me a call, chest feeling small
It don't mean shit 'till I see it all
Got my head interstate
Head interstate
Head interstate
Got my head

Look I'm into staying in 'til
I get the gall to tell me that it's
Safe outside, a happy ending

Feed me another story that's true
Another story brand new I can't forget
Diagnosis around from a book that you found
And a pill you won't have me swallow yet
Suck me a line, anything to feel right
Only get out of bed if you'll turn out the light

Got my head interstate

Look I'm into staying in 'til
I get the gall to tell me that it's
Safe outside, a happy ending

Feet in the stall, juicing the call
Don't mean nothing 'til you feel it all
I'm spending way too much time on my own
I've missed a lot and I'm tired of being alone
You call me out with that look in your eye
It's time I answered and kissed this life goodbye
I toss and turn every night in my sleep
I've locked myself inside and lost the key
I want a piece of the dream
Taste of the cream I've been chasin'
And to make it complete
You're the only one I need
If it should fall in my hands, I'd never take it for granted
My piece of the dream
You let me in without questioning why
Just took the love and belived the same as I
But I got restless, I needed to know
What dream are made of, and so youmade me go
But all my best-laid plans have gone astray
And now I know what I lost along the way
I want a piece of the dream
Taste of the cream I've been chasin'
And to make it complete
You're the only one I need
If it should fall in my hands, I'd never take it for granted
My piece of the dream
(I feel my answer near)
(it never seemed so clear)
(could be my time is here)
I want a piece of the dream
Taste of the cream I've been chasin'
And to make it complete
You're the only one I need
And if I get this one last chance I'm gonna take it
My piece of the dream
My piece of the dream
My piece of the dream
Piece of the dream
Taste of the cream
My piece of the dream
You might know of the original sin
And you might know how to play with fire
But did you know of the murder committed
In the name of love yeah, you thought what a pity

Dream on white boy, white boy
Dream on black girl, black girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams are washed away

There was a time when I did not care
And there was a time when the facts did stare
There is a dream and it's held by many
Well I'm sure you had to see it's open arms

Dream on white boy, white boy
Dream on black girl, black girl
And wake up to a brand new day
Dream on black boy, black boy
Dream on white girl, white girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams are washed away
Dream on black boy, black boy
Dream on white girl, white girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams are washed away

Dream on
Play with fire
White boy, black girl
Dream on
In the name of love
Black boy, white girl
Dream on
White boy, black girl
Black boy, white girl

Dream On
In the name of love yeah, you thought what a pity
Yeah!
The original sin
It's All!

The colonel said "these bodies stink won't someone come and drag them away"
We try to clean them up but they mow us down
And the English colonel looks the other way
Oh the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
Well I ran for the trench but I had no time to speak
Well my heart said yes
But my head said no
When the English colonel said "its time to go"

He said "Whats a few men?"
He said "Whats a few men?"
He said "Whats a few men?"

The colonel's job is never done
So he declares timeout on Christmas Day
We held the enemy in our arms
And we ploughed each others dead into the clay
Well the Lord said death will be no longer
And all of these things will pass away
There will be no sorrow and there will be no pain
And we'll swap cigrettes on christmas day

Well my heart said yes
But my head said no
When the english colonel said "its time to go"

He said "Whats a few men?"
He said "Whats a few men?"
He said "Whats a few men?"
Creeping into town with all these changes in my head
Funny how my old haunts all look new
Taxi from the airport to the Paris end of King
I'll drop my bag to see who's in

Dirty streets
Fabulous friends
Here I am
In your arms again

It's easy being famous in Sydney
Cos everyone's a star
But its gotta be deepest, darkest night
For you to see them all

There's beer, and women even for the thinking man
Join the circus, come on down
I've heard they'll even stop kicking you
Just before you hit the ground

Dirty streets
Fabulous friends
Yeah here I am
In your arms again
Get a shine on
All night and day
You rough me up
Til I gotta get away

You know I love you, but you're trying to kill me, yeah
Gotta hold your head up in the year of the rat
You know I love you, but you're trying to kill me, yeah
Gotta hold your head up in the year of the rat, tat, a-tat-tat tat

Second row, with the earpiece
And a rumble in his eye
Making sure that I don't stumble
And wishes all the freaks would die

Over there, a plain clothes cop
Looking at his watch a lot
Wondering is it time to call in the dogs

Dirty streets
Fabulous friends
Here I am
In your arms again
Get a shine on
All night and day
You rough me up til
I gotta get away

You know I love you, but you're trying to kill me, yeah
Gotta hold your head up in the year of the rat
You know I love you, but you're trying to kill me, yeah
Gotta hold your head up in the year of the rat, tat, a-tat-tat tat

You know I love you, but you're trying to kill me
You know I love you, but you're trying to kill me, yeah

I've been hearing round the town
You've been out and getting round
Whether it's right or whether it's true
I'm stuck here and I'm stuck on you

Oh no, I heard you talk in your sleep
You keep your head down and you stare at your feet
You won't look up, but you won't look away
You give the same answers no matter what I say
No matter what I say

I've been hearing round the town
You've been out and messing round
Whether it's right or whether it's true
I'm stuck here and I'm stuck on you

Oh no, I heard you talk in your sleep
You keep your head down and you stare at your feet
You won't look up, but you won't look away
You give the same answers no matter what I say
No matter what I say

No matter what I say

I've been hearing round the town

Well the kid checked his stance and tightened his pants
And took his first step in the night
Jacko said that he'd fix him up with a girl who'd be alright
Well he picked him up in his Sandman, they raced every red light in town
Jacko put on a real cool face but he's sweatin' there's no cops around

So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose

He's got a matchbox of pot hidden in a secret spot
Which they'll smoke in the old schoolyard
Well he's never too sure if he gets stoned or not
But tonight he's gonna try awful hard
And he's fifteen or sixteen, he's tryin' to make the mean team
And Jacko's his man all the way
He'll go for broke if he can, he knows that Jacko's his man
And they both pray that they'll get away

So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose
So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose

Well every guy's a clumsy poet and every girl's a beauty queen
Well they're fogging up the windows of their friends parked cars
On the way to their land of dreams, you know what I mean

Well he remembers the nights when the stars they burned bright
And she let him go all the way
Said it was different that time 'cause she said take your time
Slow down let me show you the way
Well the sand was warm underneath where they lay
A cool breeze made the waves dance and play
A band played in the hall, they were loud it was small
But who listened anyway

And every guy's a clumsy poet and every girl's a beauty queen
But they're so caught up in appearances
That they don't really know what they mean

So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose
So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose

I say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A place where nobody dared to go
The love that we came to know
They call it Xanadu
(It takes your breath and it'll leave you blind)
And now, open your eyes and see
What we have made is real
We are in Xanadu
(A dream of it, we offer you)

A million lights are dancing
And there you are, a shooting star
An everlasting world
And you're here with me, eternally

Xanadu, Xanadu
(Now we are here) in Xanadu
Xanadu, Xanadu
(Now we are here) in Xanadu

Xanadu, your neon lights will shine
For you, Xanadu

The love, the echoes of long ago
You needed the world to know
They are in Xanadu
(With every breath, you drift away)
The dream that came through a million years
That lived on through all the tears
It came to Xanadu
(The dream you dream, well, it will happen for you)

A million lights are dancing
And there you are, a shooting star
An everlasting world
And you're here with me, eternally

Xanadu, Xanadu
(Now we are here) in Xanadu
Xanadu, Xanadu
(Now we are here) in Xanadu

Now that I'm here, now that you're near
In Xanadu
Now that I'm here, now that you're near
In Xanadu
Xanadu!
Shirt tails falpping in the wind
Waiting for my train to come in
Ticket reads like a faithful friend
Run the gamut back again
Rounds completed there's no more crowds
Towel around my neck-it's finished now
Stumbles blindly to the door
Impending Monday morn

It's easy on your own
It's easy on your own
I'm gonna find a
Way back home

Many wants and mouths to feed
Time lapse it's just what you need
Walk in darkness and a light in view
It's none too soon
Vacant heads in a restaurant
Hand to hold, not really what you want
Thay're all paired and it's all up front
Take another punt

It's easy on your own
It's easy on your own
I'm gonna find a
Way back home

I can't resist you no matter how I try
After all this time can't believe that I'm
About to take this ride
Said it was over decided we were through
I've convinced myself that somebody else could take the place a you

You're part of me my one obsession
And from this power you possess I need protection
When you're staring straight through me
With those eyes those bedroom eyes
I'm lost for words so hypnotized
I can feel it in my heart it's about to start
With those eyes those bedroom eyes

I made a promise to myself that I would
Erase you from my mind leave the past behind
Be done with you for good but then I saw you I knew that I had lied
I thought of just how much I crave your touch to keep me satisfied

You're part of me my one obsession
And from this power you possess I need protection

When you're storing straight through me
With those eyes (eyes) I must admit (ooh) I'm not surprised
I can feel it in my heart (feel it in my heart) it's about to start
With those eyes (ooh) those bedroom eyes

You're a part of me my one obsession I need you
And from this power you possess I need protection hey what con I do
There is no reason to lose my sight
As long as I con see myself reflected in those eyes

Bedroom eyes (eyes) those bedroom eyes (eyes)
I'm lost for words (ooh) so hypnotized
When you stare into my soul (stare into my soul) I lose all control
Too those eyes (ooh) those bedroom eyes

Bedroom eyes (eyes) those bedroom eyes (eyes)
I must admit (ooh) I'm not surprised
I con feel it in my heart (feel it in my heart) its about to start
With those eyes (ooh) those bedroom eyes

Yeah oh no no no no no no no no those bedroom eyes
Make me feel it in my soul (ooh ooh yeah) da da da hey
Ooh dee yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
My obsession my obsession my obsession
I'm really close tonight
And I feel like I'm moving inside her
Lying in the dark
I think that I'm beginning to know her
Let it go
I'll be there when you call
Whenever I fall at your feet
And you let your tears rain down on me
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain

You're hiding from me now
There's something in the way that you're talking
The words don't sound right
But I hear them all moving inside you
Go, I'll be waiting when you call

Whenever I fall at your feet
And you let your tears rain down on me
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain

The finger of blame has turned upon itself
And I'm more than willing to offer myself
Do you want my presence or need my help
Who knows where that might lead

I fall at your feet
And you let your tears rain down on me
Whenever I fall

Aching to siphon your senses, I'm on the outside and peeking in
Listen to the gut feeling; it leaves me reeling and reels me in

Set me free
There's a world out there waiting for us all, yeah I believe
And my mind wonders to destiny;
Its rivers long and mountains tall
And meant to be

I'm turning me in; you turn me out
My original sin; I can't do without
In honesty, 2's company
It's plain to see 2's company

Hard to believe that I heard it was coming
But I won't be running; I'll stay this time
I've got a whole new focus; it's called understanding;
I'm hearing the music here in my mind

And my mind wonders to jealousy;
Where rivers stop and mountains fall into the sea

I'm turning me in; you turn me out
My original sin I can't do without
In honesty, 2's company
It's plain to see 2's company

In honesty
When the day shift is over
There'll be fear in the pipeline tonight
All the prisoners are restless
Locked up from dusk to daylight

Well how can you blame them?
I get pretty close myself sometimes
I know the score, I know the feeling
Isolation for canteen crimes

Still I gotta keep my shirt on
Gotta wait for the nerves to unwind
I gotta get control again
Gotta let the blood boil in my mind

But you don't take it out on your children
Honey I won't take my work home tonight
On the weekend I'm gonna have a good one
'Cos I'll be back in the hole in the morning light

When the schoolboy's witch hunt is over
He's gonna tell us that the system is wrong
But I'll still be working in the cold Coburg air
We've had it too easy for too long

I'm on my way home now
To face up to the rest of my life
Hot water and a home cooked meal
And send kind regards to my wife

But you don't take it out on your children
Honey I won't take my work home tonight
On the weekend I'm gonna have a good one
'Cos I'll be back in the hole in the morning light
All the leaves are brown
And the sky-why is grey
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
If I didn't tell him
I could leave today
California dreamin'
On such a winter's day

Stopped into a church (stopped into a church)
I passed along the way (passed along the way)
Oh, I got down on my knees (got down on my knees)
And I'd pretend to pray (I'd pretend to pray)
You know the preacher likes the co-old
He knows I'm gonna stay
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day... (such a winter's day)

All the leaves are brown
And the sky is grey
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and war-arm (I'd be safe and warm)
If I was in L.A. (if I was in L.A.)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day (such a winter's day)

Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Oh, I got down on my knees (got down on my knees)
And I'd pretend to pray (I'd pretend to pray)
You know the preacher likes the co-old
Well, he knows I'm gonna stay (knows I'm gonna stay)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
(California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
(California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
(California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
(California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
(California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
Charlie you're not my Charlie anymore
You're screwing it up
You're killing your soul with an audience looking on 

If I hadn't left early last night
I would have made a speech to you
How you're not the only one you're going to hurt 

If you don't believe me I don't believe in you
Makes it all feel better does it?
Makes you feel like heaven does it?
You loved it and you spent accordingly 

You can't afford it now
You'll try and you'll fail
And love it like a little dog
And feed it on the scraps you find
And kiss it while you're still asleep
You buy now and pay laterp So where's the problem you can ask if you keep your head up
But the road is long and you're falling asleep at the wheel
Here's a girl going crazy about you and I'm not far behind
Can you care about your friends anymore?
You buy now and pay later

I FEEL LIKE I’VE BEEN BLOWN APART
THERE ARE PIECES HERE, I DON’T KNOW WHERE THEY GO, I DON’T KNOW WHERE THEY GO,
KISS ME ON MY SALTY LIPS, I BET YOU FEEL A LITTLE CRAZY BUT FOR ME
WE’LL BE FAMOUS ON T.V

WOULD IT BE MY FAULT IF I COULD TURN YOU ON?
WOULD I BE SO BAD IF I COULD TURN YOU ON?
WHEN I KISS YOUR MOUTH I WANT TO TASTE  IT
TURN YOU UPSIDE DOWN, DON’T WANNA’ WASTE IT

I JUMP ON YOU, YOU JUMP ON ME
YOU PUSH ME OUT AND EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW
I LOVE YOU I’D BE INCLINED TO SLAP YOU IN THE MOUTH
WHEN I KISS YOUR SALTY LIPS, YOU WILL FEEL A LITTLE CRAZY, BUT FOR ME, I’LL BE FAMOUS ON T.V

NOW, WILL IF BE MY FAULT IF I TAKE YOUR LOVE AND THROW IT WIDE?
YOU MIGHT RESTRAIN ME, BUT COULD YOU REALLY BLAME ME?
AND YOU WILL FEEL YOU’RE BLOWN APART
ALL THE PIECES THERE WILL FIT TO MAKE YOU WHOLE
AND I KNOW WHERE THEY GO

Ooooh, It just's a soul kinda feelin' I'm in (yeah)
I'm movin' with the beat
It's just a soul kinda feelin' I'm in (yeah)
A-soundin' kinda sweet
Not talkin' 'bout religion, no
Not talkin' 'bout fashion, no
Not talkin' 'bout money, no
Not talkin' 'bout fight, from the right
It's just a soul kinda feelin' I'm in
A-movin' with the beat
It's just a soul kinda feelin' I'm in
A-soundin' kinda sweet
I'm talkin' 'bout my girl - standin' by me
Darlin' you're seein' me
I'm feelin' alright - day and night
You might be sittin' alone in your room
Or at a party with people you don't know
Ah then you hear a familiar tune
And you know-ow that ver-ery soon
You'll be movin' - movin', movin' on your own
Ooh, it's a whole kinda feelin' your in
A-movin' with the beat
It's just a soul kinda feelin' I'm in (yeah)
A-soundin' kinda sweet

Feel it in your soul, baby
A feel it in your sou-ou-ou-ou-oul
I'm talkin' 'bout it, bea-ea-ea-ea-ea-eat
Yeah-yeah-ye
The take down
Is a mystery
All I want to know is why
Your eyes
Taking over
The apple in my eye
I'm in
A crowded room
Can't hear a single word they say
They're just talking faces
I don't believe I know your name

I smell you
On my finger tips
I hear you
Whispering
I feel you
All over me
I'm never gonna be the same

Whatcha
Trying to do to me
Please tell me the rules of the game
You see me
Shaking right through
No surprise
I'm looking this way

Deliver me
From your spell
Gimme gimme more of the same
Deliver me
From your spell
Gimme more gimme more
Gimme more of the same

Deliver me

Whatcha
Trying to do to me
Please tell me the rules of the game
'Cause I'm just
Out of my skin
But the thoughts and the questions remain

Gimme more gimme more
Gimme more of the same

Gimme

More of the same
We curse at the things that go wrong through the day
And vow that we'll snatch it, go far away
But when day is done and we're soon feeling well
And laughter rings out from Three Rivers Hotel

There's Wesley the barman and young Irish Joe
Serving the booze and collecting the dough
What a stir they would cause if they ever should tell
All the secrets they've learned in Three Rivers Hotel

On the night after payday there's fun and romance
It's a night for the fam'lies to sing and to dance
You can let down your hair and come out of your shell
And do your own thing in Three Rivers Hotel

And if you listen to the bosses when the night's gettin' late
On the progress they're makin' the best in the state
They'd be finished this line and this maint'nance as well
If they worked like they bragged in Three Rivers Hotel

And if you think you can drink we've got money to back
On stayers like Cass and old grader Jack
And they tell me old Coster gives everyone hell
When he gets on the booze in three Rivers Hotel

(Spoken)
Yeah, he's a whopper

When this job is finished we'll pack up and go
To another construction still chasing big dough
But wherever I wander my memory will dwell
On those happy days in Three Rivers Hotel

Started ou-out last night, I was thinkin' of days gone by-y 
Of the times I've had, And the things that I've left behi-ind 
Some change, some die, Still we manage to survi-ive 
It's knowin' when and what to do-oo, It's up to you-ou 
Don't know what's goin' on, I can't wait 'til 

One summer, I'll find a way-hay-ay-ay 
One summer, will always remai-ai-ai-ain 
One summer, remember the way-ay 

Hauled down, turned around, Find myself facin' the wa-a-all 
I think back to school, it's all the same, slightly different ru-u-ules 
Ou-outside on your own, Watch yourself 'cause you're all alo-one 
I know what's going on, I can't wait 'til 

One summer, I'll find a way-ay-ay-ay 
One summer, will always remai-hai-ai-ain 
One summer, remember the way-hay-ay-ay 
One summer, never the sa-ha-a-ame 

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
I think back not far, Drivin' down the beach in my car-ar-ar 
Another pla-ace same time, Icky runs along a fine li-ine 
Down there, no chance, He's trapped in a different roma-a-ance 
He's life a fait accompli, He never di-id see-ee-ee 

One summer, I'll find a way-hay-ay-ay 
One summer, will always remai-hai-ai-ain 
One summer, remember the way-hay-ay-ay 
One summer, never the sa-ha-a-ame 

One summer, I'll find a way-hay-ay-ay 
One summer, will always remai-hai-ai-ain 
One summer, remember the way-hay-ay-ay 
One summer, I'll find a way-hay-ay-ay 
One summer, will always remai-hai-ai-ain (fade)

There was a rumour on the grapevine, the word had got around
There was a party goin' on on the wild side of town
I said to Jody : 'Do you wanna go ?'
Now Jody likes to party and I knew she wouldn't say no

Well ,we got the right street but we got the wrong number
Then like a shot in the dark, we heard that thunder

(Of the party to end all parties)
Wildest one in the book
(Party to end all parties)
Step inside and take a look

Motor Bikin' Bobby said to Sleazy Sue
'I know exactly what we are gonna do'
'We're goin' upstairs, gonna lock the bedroom door'
'We're gonna party till we can't party anymore'

(At the party to end all parties)
Turn of the century
(Party to end all parties)
A riot in the first degree

(Party to end all parties
Party on the wild side of town
(Party to end all parties)
We ain't ever gonna live this down

Two guys in the bathroom, they've been there for an hour
Someone said that they were takin' a shower
Jimmy couldn't wait so he kicked down the door
Found his girlfriend and the two guys havin' a party on the floor

There was a rumour on the grapevine, the word had got around
There was a party goin' on on the wild side of town
I said to Jody : 'Do you wanna go ?'
Now Jody likes to party and I knew she wouldn't say no

Well ,we got the right street but we got the wrong number
Then like a shot in the dark, we heard that thunder

(Of the party to end all parties)
Wildest one in the book
(Party to end all parties)
Step inside and take a look

(Party to end all parties)
Turn of the century
(Party to end all parties)
A riot in the first degree

(At the party to end all parties)
Wildest one in the book
(Party to end all parties)
Step inside and take a look at the party

(Party to end all parties)
Party on the wild side of town
(Party to end all parties)
We ain't ever gonna live this down
Everyday i see you wearing things that have never been worn before
While the children at the government schools send money for the poor
And all you buy you bargain for, with your little man
So that from your silks down to your paramour
Your tres, tres, paragon

So it's a backbeach in the summer
The chalet for the snow
You poor hoochie gucci fiorucci mama
You got really no place to go

Antiques flown in from Venice fill your house upon the hill
While your money sold the soul love of rock and roll
For some cheap disco thrill
I've seen your peers pouting over beers
The loneliness it showed
Mistaking tacky sex for sensuality
They bought in Toorak Road

So it's a backbeach in the summer
The chalet for the snow
You poor hoochie gucci fiorucci mama
You got really no place to go

Inside her empty castle
Her lonely heart will dwell
The life that she's been losing's
Like some stony bagatelle
The loving that you never found
You don't know the reason why

Oh hoochie gucci fiorucci mama
Don't you cry
At my nan's I wasn't thinking
Over boiled beans and chicken
Something cool fell in my juice cup
Sudden I could lie and make stuff up
Is that why
My future's so bright?
So strap in and go
The backyard rock show

When all city folk got southern
Paint my face up with my brother
Uncle choked and started shaking
Over whiskey, eggs and bacon

Is that why
Our nights look so bright?
So strap in and go
Backyard rock show
I stand in the distance, of you, from afar,
Should I offer some assistance,
Should it matter who you are,
We all get hurt by love,
And we all have our cross to bear,
But in the name of understanding, now
Our problems should be shared

Confide in me (2x)

I can keep a secret and throw away the key,
But sometimes to release it,
Is to set our children free,
We all get hurt by love,
And we all have our cross to bear,
But in the name of understanding now,
Our problems should be shared

Confide in me (4x)

Stick or twist, the choice is yours
Hit or miss, what's mine is yours (2x)

We all get hurt by love,
And we all have our cross to bear,
But in the name of understanding now,
Our problems should be shared

Confide in me (8x)
I've been walkin' these streets alone
Ain't no comfort for a heart of stone
You see a shadow fallin' in the rain
You find hope you better look again

We're hungry for the bitter fire
Driven by a wild desire
Stagger through the dust and haze
Broken in these empty days

Baby, don't make a murmur
Baby now don't you speak
They need a light to shine on through
Down on Angel Street

Out in the land of mercy
Over by the waterline
They need a light to shine on through
But it ain't no friend of mine

This storm will never break tonight
So you'd better take some care tonight
There's a hammer beatin' hard inside
You can run but you can never hide

All you got it this moment
Twenty-first centurys yesterday
You can care all you want
Everybody does, yeah, that's ok

[Pre-Chorus]
So slide over here
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw
You're one of my kind

I need you tonight
Cause I'm not sleeping
Theres something about you girl
That makes me sweat
How do you feel?
I'm lonely
What do you think?
Can't think at all
Whatcha gonna do?
Gonna live my life

[Pre-Chorus]
So slide over here
And give me a moment
You're one of my kind

I need you tonight
Cause I'm not sleeping
Theres something about you girl
That makes me sweat
How do you feel?
I'm lonely
What do you think?
Can't think at all
Whatcha gonna do?
Gonna live my life
How do you feel?

I'm lonely..

What do you think?
Can't think at all
Whatcha gonna do?
Gonna live my life
So slide over here
And give me a moment

[Outro]
So slide over here
And give me a moment
You're one of my kind

She was a catch,
We were a match
I was the match that would fire up her snatch
There was a catch
I was no match
I was fired from her crutch
Now I sit around and watch
The mermaids sun themselves out on the rocks
They are beyond our touch
I watch and watch
Wave at me
They wave at me
They wave and slip
Back into the sea

All the ones who come
All the ones who go
Down to the water
All the ones who come
All the ones who go
Down to the sea

I believe in God
I believe in mermaids too
I believe in 72 virgins on a chain 
(why not, why not)
I believe in the rapture
For I've seen your face
On the floor of the ocean
At the bottom of the ray

I do drive a relentless course
I do husband alertness course
I do mermaid alertness course
Watch them out on the rocks
Wave at me
Wave at me
They wave and slip
Back into the sea

All the ones who come
All the ones who go
Down to the water
All the ones who come
And all the ones who go
Down to the sea

For all the ones who come
And all the ones who go
Down to the water
All the ones who come
And all the ones who go
Down to the sea
I woke up bright and early this morning
My little girl's not in sight
I've been lookin' ev'rywhere
Morning, noon and daylight

Cos she's so fine, she's so fine, she's so fine
She's so fine, you know I wish she was mine

I got something to tell her
Maybe she'll listen, maybe not
But I've never loved a woman like that before
Cos all my love she's got

Well, she's so fine, she's so fine, she's so fine
She's so fine, you know I wish she was mine

Ah, c'mon

Oh, she's so fine you know I wish she were mine and that's all!

Oh, come on, but that was until now
Oh, come on, you are all I want
All I want, how could I hold out for long?

Oh, come on, who cares what people say?
Oh, come on, 'cause we can sleep all day
Oh, come on, tonight won't keep away, let's just play

Oh, come on, when push comes to shove
Oh, come on, you're more than enough
You're more than enough
Come on
Come on
Come on
People, wasting away in paradise
Going backward, once in a while
Moving ahead, falling behind
What do you believe, what do you believe
What do you believe is true
Nothing they say makes a difference this way
Nothing they say will do

You take all the trouble that you can afford
At least you won't have time to be bored
At least you won't have time to be bored

Oh the power and the passion, oh the temper of the time
Oh the power and the passion
Sometimes you've got to take the hardest line

Sunburnt faces around, with skin so brown
Smiling zinc cream and crowds, Sundays the beach never a cloud
Breathing eucalypt, pushing panel vans
Stuff and munch junk food
Laughing at the truth, cos Gough was tough til he hit the rough
Uncle Sam and John were quite enough

Too much of sunshine too much of sky
It's just enough to make you want to cry
It's just enough to make you want to cry

Oh the power and the passion, oh the temper of the time
Oh the power and the passion
Sometimes you've got to take the hardest line

I see buildings, clothing the sky, in paradise
Sydney, nights are warm
Daytime telly, blue rinse dawn
Dad's so bad he lives in the pub, it's a underarms and football clubs
Flat chat, Pine Gap, in every home a Big Mac
And no one goes outback, that's that
You take what you get and get what you please
It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees

Oh the power and the passion, oh the temper of the time
Oh the power and the passion
Sometimes you've got to take the hardest line
Take me to the Emerald City
Down yellow brick roads fast I run
Scarecrow friends will dance beside me
Tin toy brothers bright as sun

Take me to the Emerald City
Wizards will give us lemonade
It's a land of pleasures pretty
Ruby roses never fade

Children gather fragile flowers
Stars will sing a lullaby
You're an angel fly forever
Living life behind the sky

Take me to the Emerald City
Wizards will give us lemonade
It's a land of pleasures pretty
Ruby roses never fade

Rain it falls like tinsel teardrops
Rivers flow through jungles tall
Witches watch through magic mirrors
Frost and fog covers crystal balls

Take me to the Emerald City
Wizards will give us lemonade
It's a land of pleasures pretty
Ruby roses never fade

It's a land of pleasures pretty
Ruby roses never fade
Look around you, look up here
Take time to make time, make time to be there
Look around, be a part
Feel for the winter, but don't have a cold heart

And I love you best
You're not like the rest
You're there when I need you
You're there when I need
I'm gonna need you

A long time ago I had a lady to love
She made me think of things I never thought of
Now she's gone and I'm on my own
A love song has come into my mind
A love song, it was there all the time

So lady, let me take a look at you now
You're there on the dance floor, making me want you somehow
Oh lady, I think it's only fair I should say to you
Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you, 'cause maybe I do

Look around, come to me
I have no answers, but know where I wanna be
I look around, play a part
I was born in the winter and cooled by a warm heart

And I love you best
You're not like the rest
You're there when I need you
You're there when I need
I'm gonna need you

So lady, let me take a look at you now
You're there on the dance floor, making me want you somehow
Oh lady, I think it's only fair I should say to you
Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you, 'cause maybe I do
Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you, lady I do
Blood flows just like water
Changing into wine
Everything looks better
In the black sunshine
In the black sunshine

Echoes drag my memories
Back where they began
And I just can't be sorry
'Cause those tears turn into sand
All those tears torn into sand

I don't care now
For what might have been
The heart of darkness
Closes in on me

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ah
Ah
Ah
Na na na-na-na
Out here nothin' changes
Not in a hurry anyway
You can feel the endlessness
With the comin' of the light o' day
You're talkin' 'bout a chosen place
You wanna sell it in a marketplace
Well
Well just a minute now

You're standin' on
Solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change
Are blowin' down the line

Right down the line

Well round about the dawn of time
The Dreaming all began
A crowd of people came
Well they were lookin' for their promised land
We're runnin' from the heart of darkness
Searchin' for the heart of light
It was their paradise

Well they were standin' on
Solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change
Were blowin' cold that night

Well they were standin' on the shore one day
Saw the white sails in the sun
Wasn't long before they felt the sting
White man, white law, white gun
Don't tell me that it's justified
Cause somewhere
Someone lied
Yeah, well someone lied
Someone lied
Genocide
Well someone lied

And now you're standin' on
Solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change
Are blowin' down the line

Solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change
Are blowin' down the line

Solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change
Are blowin' down the line
No!
As I went a-walkin' on Kilgary Mountain
I spied Colonel Pepper, and his money he was countin';
I rattled out my pistols and I drew forth my saber
Cryin', "Stand and deliver, for I am a bold deceiver."

Musha rig um du rum da
Whack fol the daddy o
Whack fol the daddy o
There's whisky in the jar
The gold and silver coins, they looked so bright and shiny
Oh, I took them home straightway, and I gave 'em to my Molly;
She vowed and she promised that she never would deceive me
But the devil's in the women, oh, you never can believe 'em

But when I awoke between six and seven
The guards were all around me in numbers odd and even;
I reached for my pistols, but alas, I was mistaken;
My pistols had been fired, and a prisoner I was taken

They put me in the jail without judge or writin'
For robbing Colonel Pepper, oh, on Kilgary Mountain
But they didn't take my fists, so I knocked the sentry down
And bade farewell to the jail in Sligo town

Some people take delight in fishin' and in bowlin';
Oh, others take delight in the carriages a-rollin';
But I take delight in the juice of the barley
And courtin' pretty girls 'til the morning so early

I spent a lifetime lookin' for you
Single bars and good time lovers were never true
Playing a fools game, hopin' to win
Tellin' those sweet lies and losin' again.

I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many places
Searchin' her eyes, lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Hoping to find a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover,
You - lookin' for love.

I was alone then, no love in site
I did every thing I could to get me through the night
Don''t know where it started or where it might end
I'd turn to a stranger just like a friend.
Early one mornin' the sun was shinin'
I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through
Tangled up in blue

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder
"We'll meet again someday on the avenue,"
Tangled up in blue

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said
"You look like the silent type."
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

So now I'm goin' back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view
Tangled up in blue

Maybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question
Like in your eyes
I see my future in an instant
And there it goes
I think I've found my best friend

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only this sense of completion
And in your eyes
I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for
I think I've found my way home

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

A thousand angels dance around you
I am complete now that I've found you

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

Dr. Heckyll works late at the laboratory
Where things are not as they seem
Dr. Heckyll wishes nothing more desperately
Than to fulfill all of his dreams
Letting loose with a scream in the dead of night
As he's breaking new ground
Trying his best to unlock all the secrets
But he's not sure what he's found
Dr. Heckyll is his own little guinea pig
'Cos they all think he's mad
Sets his sights on the search of a lifetime
And he's never, never sad

Whoa oh, it's off to work he goes
In the name of science and all its wonders....

This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive
They are a person who feels good to be alive
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive
Believes the underdog will eventually survive

Not long now till the ultimate experiment
He's breaking all the rules
He wants to cure all matter of imbalance
In this world of fools
He locks the door and he looks around nervously
He knows there's no one there
He drinks it down and waits for some reaction
To all his work and care

Hey, hey he fumbles for what to say
He loves the wo except for all the people....

This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive
They are a person who feels good to be alive
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive
Believes the underdog will eventually survive

Whoa oh, it's out at night he goes
He slips easily into conversation

Hey hey, he's cool in every way
Sometimes he loves to sing that old black magic

This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive
They are a person who feels good to be alive
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive
Believes the underdog will eventually survive

This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive
They are a person who feels good to be alive
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive
Believes the underdog will eventually survive
Ridin' down the highway
Goin' to a show

Gettin' robbed
Gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up
Broken boned

Gettin' took
I tell you folks
It's harder than it looks

It's a long way to the top if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you want to rock 'n' roll
If you think it's easy doin' one night stands

Playin' in a band

It's a long way to the top if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you want to rock 'n' roll
If you want to be a star of stage and screen
Look out it's rough and mean

It's a long way to the top if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you want to rock 'n' roll
But it's a long way
It's a long way, (you should've told me)
It's a long way, such a long way

Love is kind love is wine
So much laughter in your eyes
And you know that I will love you
Till the last flower dies

Do you hear music far away?
There's so much I'd like to say
Got a felling oh so new
So I'm singing just for you

You are everywhere I find in my heart and on my mind
Time is all I have time for you

You are all that I will be
You're a sunrise on the sea
You're the love I cannot hide
You're a magic carpet ride

You are everywhere I find in my heart and on my mind
Time is all I have time for you
Love is kind love is wine
So much laughter in your eyes
And you know that I will love you
Till the last flower dies
Till the last flower dies
Till the last flower dies
Hey Mom, why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you teach me a thing or two?
You just let me go, out into the world
You never thought to share what you knew

So I walked under a bus
I got hit by a train
Keep fallin' in love
Which is kind of the same
I've sunk out at sea, crashed my car, gone insane
And it felt so good, I wanna do it again

Hey Mom, why didn't you warn me?

'Cause about boys there's something I should have known
They're like chocolate cake, like cigarettes
I know they're bad for me but I just can't leave 'em alone

(Repeat Chorus)
Hey Mom, since we're talkin'
What was it like when you were young?
Has the world changed or is still the same?
A man can kill and still be the sweetest fun

(Repeat Chorus)
I am thru with hanging around
With all the boys in town
Now I want a man around
Get me out of here

I am a just red brassiere to all the boys in town
Put this bus in top gear get me out of here

I must have been desperate I must have been pretty low
I must have been desperate I must have been pretty low

I was always driving home all the boys in town
But they never telephoned get me out of here
I think they're pretty phoney
You're not like the rest
You've heard of matrimony
They've all flunked the test

I must have been desperate I must of been pretty low
I must have been desperate I must have been pretty slow

Oh I'm tired oh I'm wired
Oh I'm tired, oh I'm wired ahh

Too much too young, too much too young
Too much too young, too much too young
Get me out of here, get me out of here
Get me out of here, get me out of here
Get me out of here, get me out of here
Get me out of here
I was just a boy when I sat down
To watch the news on TV
I saw some ordinary slaughter
I saw some routine atrocity
My father said, don't look away
You got to be strong, you got to be bold, now
He said, that in the end it is beauty
That is going to save the world, now

And she moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze
She moves among the flowers
She moves something deep inside of me

I was walking around the flower show like a leper
Coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria
When I saw you standing there, green eyes, black hair
Up against the pink and purple wisteria
You said, hey, nature boy, are you looking at me
With some unrighteous intention?
My knees went weak,
I couldn't speak, I was having thoughts
That were not in my best interests to mention

And she moves among the flowers
And she floats upon the smoke
She moves among the shadows
She moves me with just one little look

You took me back to your place
And dressed me up in a deep sea diver's suit
You played the patriot, you raised the flag
And I stood at full salute
Later on we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb
And made it impossible to speak
As you closed in, in slow motion,
Quoting Sappho, in the original Greek

She moves among the shadows
She floats upon the breeze
She moves among the candles
And we moved through the days
and through the years

Years passed by, we were walking by the sea
Half delirious
You smiled at me and said, Babe
I think this thing is getting kind of serious
You pointed at something and said
Have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?
It was then that I broke down
It was then that you lifted me up again

She moves among the sparrows
And she walks across the sea
She moves among the flowers
And she moves something deep inside of me

She moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze
She moves among the flowers
And she moves right up close to me
I took my love out for a walk into the rain
The time had come when we should talk things out again
(Where did you go?) I can't recall
(What did you do?) not much at all
The other side of paradise
Paradise

If we were perfect we would know perfect love
But we're so different, we can't go like a hand fits in a glove
(Where did you go?) I can't recall
(What did you do?) not much at all
The other side of paradise
Paradise
Paradise

The other side, the other side of your love
Well, I'll cross that line
But that's not enough
It's too much

The other side, the other side of your love
Well, I'll cross that line
But that's not enough
No, it's too much

But in the end it will depend on you and me
And if you still call yourself my friend you soon will see
It's the a way we treat ourselves and those all 'round
We must believe that we can help if we could
Fight against our prejudice and try to straighten out this mess
(What did you do?) I cannot recall
(Where did you go?) not far at all
The other side of paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Oh, ah

Words were exchanged last ni-ight 
You could call it a fi-ight 
I-i-it's such a sha-ame, I never thought we would
Wouldn't be so ba-ad, if it weren't so good 
I've had enough of that
With other loves in days gone by-y
It wasn't much I know
Mmm just enou-ou-ou-ough, enough to make me cry 

If you leave me-ee, can I come too? 
We can always stay
But if you leave me, can I come too? 
And if you go-o, can I come too-OO-oo-OO-oo-oo-oooo? 

Don't let it happen again 
'Cause that I couldn't ta-ake
Ooh once was quite enough 
It's easy to forgive, harder to forget 

If you leave me-ee, can I come too-oo? 
We can always sta-ay 
But if you leave me, can I come too? 
And if you go-o, can I come too-OO-oo-OO-oo-oo-ooo? 

I've had enough of that

Yay, yay, yay-ay, yay-ay
Can I come too-OO-oo?
Can I come too?
Ay-yay, yay-ay, yay-ay, yay-ay
Ay-yay...
I can still see your eyes
Lookin' up through stormy skies
Baby it's a crime
But you do it all the time

Tell those sad lonely tales
Sweet love runnin' off the rails
Take me to the line
Then turn our money into wine

Baby it's a crime
But you do it all the time
Say that you'll be mine
Then turn our money into wine

I've been waitin' for you
Knowin' what you put me through
Baby it's a crime
But you do it all the time

I've been countin' the days
Bittersweet endless ways
You promise to be mine
Then turn our money into wine

Rock on hungry river
Roll on empty moon
Ain't got a worry
If I know you'll be here soon
Take me through the fire
Tell me it's alright
If you say you're leavin'
Then I'll drown here tonight
Show me some emotion
I need to know right now
How can I read your mind?
Truly my love is blind

You must know I've fallen hard for you
But you don't react as if you do
And your eyes just seem to look straight through
But I see you

Show me some emotion
I cannot understand
There is no need to hide
All that you feel inside
Show some emotion
Why are you waiting for?
How can I read your mind?
Truly my love is blind

Did somebody hurt you once before?
There are other friendships left for you to explore
You play your cards close to your chest
What you're thinking I can only guess
Here is my request, it's just this

Show me some emotion

Show me your emotion
How can I read your mind?
Truly my love must be blind
My love is blind
My love is blind
My love is
Blind
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
(Uh-huh)
(Uh-huh)
(Uh-huh)
(Uh-huh)
You can haul my ass with a word from any line you took
From a laugh or any microphone you shook
You turned my head from a rock into a burning bush
With a chord, call, or Leon tape you'd push
Yeah, yeah
Anyway we split the bill
You couldn't leave us ever standing still
Anyhow we try to forget
We'd can still remember the date they met

Every aside is better than one of my jokes
Would you die, if I ever called you out my folks?
And how long can we talk about Mick and Keith
"Bayou Country" or "Exile On Main Street"?

Ooh could you still remember?
Still remember?
We pay to shed a sombre tear in the darkness together here
One among the hundreds, crying for the millions
And when the house lights break the trance
Only then unclasp our hands
Compose ourselves and fix our hair
"We would have all been Schindler there"
Drive in silence slowly home
Now horror's more than skin and bone

And can you see in twenty years
We'll pay to shed the same cheap tears
In a film about an island, watch our hero take a stand
Pay our money gladly to wash our hands

Watching the movie we'll ask how the people might have known
Let it happen there without a fight
Kept driving on quietly home
Left the Timorese alone - 400 miles from Darwin

The two-minute hate is now the three-hour love
With any action left to up above
Those people then could turn their heads
Now all the same we sleep instead
While 400 miles from Darwin
East Timor is dying

Watching the movie we'll ask how the people might have known
Let it happen there without a fight
Kept driving on quietly home
Left the Timorese alone - 400 miles from Darwin

We all say that we don't care for money
Money takes a second place
Now I don't care but it seems kind of funny
Me and the boys in a race

And in between times
Crossing county lines
Drinking cheap red wines
Coping with our ups and downs

And the band just keeps on a-rollin'
We all keep it on goin'
Have another on me
One for the road

Day in, day out, times keep a-changing
Every night a different crowd
It's hard keeping track of how our life's rearranging
At times it helps to cry out loud

As we get older
We'll go our separate ways
Look for better days
There maybe ain't a second chance

And the band just keeps on a-rollin'
We all keep it on goin'
Have another on me
One for the road

When the sun don't shine
We hardly get time to be living, no, no, no
We get no rest
But we do our best every night

When we're feeling down
We can call our town
It's at the end of a telephone line
It's sad that we won't be goin' home for a long time

And the band just keeps on a-rollin'
We all keep it on goin'
Have another on me
One for the road, yeah, yeah, yeah

And the band just keeps on a-rollin'
We all keep it on goin'
The band just keeps on a-rollin'
We all keep it on goin'
The band just keeps on a-rollin'
We all keep it on goin'
The band just keeps on a-rollin'
We all keep it on goin'
It's the heart of the winter
And I'm alone on this bay
The big tide carried you away
You got carried away
Did my eyes deceive me
Did I really see you leave me
Downstreet in the rain
They're tumblin' in a row
It's comin' round again
The travellin' heartache show
I might get through the day
But the night time's still ahead of me
I just can't break away
I'm in the hands of the enemy
No medals for bravery
Just wounds that never heal
And the grinding of the wheel
You turn on the wheel
Do my fears grow stronger
Is this cold war gettin' longer
Chippin' rocks to stone
On this island penitentiary
No chance of my own
Across a sea of treachery

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)
I don't talk all that much about how I feel and such
Though I try to keep in touch with this heart of mine
Now I'm gonna speak out loud because it makes me feel so proud
That we're standing the test of time
You're 39, you're beautiful, you're mine

I wake up every day, on my tongue a song of praise
You still take my breath away in the morning light
Down all the dogging days, you keep on getting better with age
Like a lovingly made bottle of wine
You're 39, you're beautiful, you're mine

Like a sailing ship at sea bearing spice and history
You come swaying to me in your prime
You're 39, you're beautiful and you're mine
I'm gonna say it one more time
You're 39, you're beautiful and you're mine

[Intro: N'fa]
Karma
What goes around comes around right? (Right)
How you treat people is how they treat you back
Disrespect them or knock them
They're gonna slap you back (Yeah)
Sometimes it hurts and that's
Bad karma, watch out for it

How am I supposed to live in a world of negatives?
How am I supposed to love in a world full of push and shove?
How am I supposed to breathe in a world full of lust and greed?
Well, I guess I'll have to live day to day
And pray to God that'll I'll be okay-ay-ay

These fat raps think they fit like they the Iron Man
I got the iron tongue and the iron hand, I'll make the final stand
The final showdowns come round and hit ya
As I throw down my gauntlet to switch the picture
If ya look in the mirror, you're bound to get a reflection
Like with every action, there is a reaction
With your dodgy actions, you're causing negative drama
And if you know God's law, you best watch for karma
Now I'mma bomb ya, running your traps like tacks
You think you're floating on the cream, you and your rat pack
Well I'm take that, thought back, now let's dwell
How I should lock you like jail cells so we can exhale
I'm a bull and you's a matador, I'm seeing red, you outta sorts
I'm a target like darts boards, you floating in space like astronauts
I started off last but now I'm first
While you're shaking, I cut off like umbilicals at birth

How am I supposed to live in a world of negatives?
How am I supposed to love in a world full of push and shove?
How am I supposed to breathe in a world full of lust and greed?
Well, I guess I'll have to live day to day
And pray to God that'll I'll be okay-ay-ay

I look around the city and it's all such a pity
Everybody trying to be pretty, don't care for nitty gritty
I look around the block, nobody's playing hopscotch
They're to busy on the internet surfing that rock
Just converse kind of rude, like
"So what you trying to prove, mate?"
I say, "Nothing, I'm just tryna build the feeling, not live like you"
I got plans to take this city up to Senate
As life's one big race and I want all entries to win it
If you're not with it like quitters, then get out of my face
You got no place in my grace with your grimace
You're a disgrace with a sire, you need to recon through your fire
And look higher, higher! (Look around)
I got sounds that help you get down, so you can get up
And avoid them stinking rats that get me fed up
Yeah, they make me wanna throw up, they gotta grow up
Or they'll be feeling abandoned while I'll be sailing like Noah

How am I supposed to live in a world of negatives?
How am I supposed to love in a world full of push and shove?
How am I supposed to breathe in a world full of lust and greed?
Well, I guess I'll have to live day to day
And pray to God that'll I'll be okay-ay-ay

[Interlude: N'fa]
Melbourne, Sydney, to Brisbane, and Darwin
To Perth, Adelaide, Tassie
And all across the O-Z-Z-I-E

Picture I'm the boulder, it's time to roll
I will continue like part two with no to and fro
Aiming at infinity, start a nasty road
Had to leave the poor luck souls before they fall, so
I got the key to the door and I'm searching for the keyhole
And I unlock the door, I bring new love to my people
Unlike these fickle fanatics that wanna cause death
Cut hopes late, praying we fall to hell's depth
As I watch and see all our progress regress
As what goes up comes down, nevertheless
We stung by the horror, cold hearts with armour
Boomerang effect as we all face our karma

How am I supposed to live in a world of negatives?
How am I supposed to love in a world full of push and shove?
How am I supposed to breathe in a world full of lust and greed?
Well, I guess I'll have to live day to day
And pray to God that'll I'll be okay-ay-ay

Down a bush track off a dirt road
No milkbar, no postcode
In the state of blissed out mind
It's always 1969

Ah, when hippy boy meets hippy girl
In Brunswick street tonight
She'll take him back to the hippy hut
Where everything's alright
Take off her cheesecloth kaftan
And brew some Jasmine tea
Read Kerouac and Ginsberg
And trip on poetry

Yeah, we live our lives in a hippy hut
And our front door is never shut
There's love and peace out in the bush
Away from all the shove and push
Our Kombi van goes put put put
To our happy hippy happy hippy hippy hut

Wear a headband, seek nirvana
Pack a bong and smoke banana
Tofu gut and Lily Ponds
They dance along in leather thongs

We'll build a mudbrick heaven
Wear flowers in our hair
Potbelly stove and windchimes
Seagrass everywhere

Yeah, we live our lives in a hippy hut
Our front door is never shut
There's love and peace out in the bush
Away from all that shove and push
Our Kombi van goes put put put
To our happy hippy happy hippy hippy hut
Happy hippy happy hippy hippy hut

Now hippy girl and hippy guy
Lay the mattress on the floor
Burn that incense all night long
Submit to cosmic law

I searched the world for the Holy Grail
Pinned the donkey on the tail
I knew my life was in a rut
Till I found my (hippy hut)

Now we drink rainwater from a tank
Most of the time our minds a blank
I get to feel just like a king
Up here where the bellbirds sing

We live our lives in a hippy hut
Our front door is never shut
It's the shack we call our home
And we never feel alone
Our Kombi van goes put put put
To our happy hippy happy hippy hippy hut

Yeah, we live our lives in a hippy hut
Share the tomb with old King Tut
There's love and peace out in the bush
Away from all the shove and push
Our Kombi van goes put put put
To our happy hippy happy hippy hippy hut
Happy hippy happy hippy hippy hut

We live our lives in a hippy hut
Share the tomb with old King Tut
There's love and peace out in the bush
Away from all the shove and push
Our Kombi van goes put put put
To our happy hippy happy hippy hippy hut
Happy hippy happy hippy hippy hut
Our happy hippy happy hippy hippy hut

I thought that love was science fiction
Until I saw you today
Now that love is my addiction
I've thrown all my books away
I thought that love was science fiction

Until I saw you today
Now that love is my addiction
I've thrown all my books away

When I was young I was so naive
I didn't believe no I didn't believe
I didn't believe

Never thought that we'd last this long
Always thought that they'd dropped the bomb
Drop the bomb (didn't)

I thought that love was science fiction
Until I saw you today
Now that love is my addiction
I've thrown all my books away

When I was young I was so naive
I didn't believe no I didn't believe
I didn't believe

I've been waiting for a man from space
To come to earth to meet the human race
The human race (didn't)

I wish tonight could last forever
It's like I've never seen the stars before
We sit in silence by a river
Aware that this can't happen anymore
And you catch the moonlight in your hair
And a whisper from nowhere softly tells me that
I don't want nobody
I don't want nobody
I don't want no-one if I don't have you
I guess you've always shared my feelings
But until now they've only held us back
A wilderness of fear and darkness
That now reveals itself as innocence
And you are so perfect in my sight
We fall silent like the night that protects us
And I don't want nobody
I don't want nobody
I don't want no-one if don't have you
We must return to home and shelter
And, like before, we'll go our separate ways
What we have shared can't make any difference now
Your lover calls, your lover calls
And you go back there
While I only wonder what I'll do
All tomorrow without you-
All I know is now
I don't want nobody
I don't want no-one if I don't have you
Tom and Harry were the best of friends
They called themselves The Dharma Bums
Lit out from their home and kin
With a mandolin and a pair of thumbs
Worked side by side all that summer
Picking those grapes from the vine
Read by one light, took turns to cook
The oldest story in the book
Enter Richard and his sister, June
Just before the season's end
Richard's guitar knows a whole lotta tunes
Harry starts a-picking on the mandolin
Down by the dam in the moonlight
They play 'til their fingers get sore
When June kisses Tom, Harry doesn't know where to look
The oldest story in the book
The band pull into town in the afternoon
They've got a hit song on the radio
Richard calls up his sister, June
And says 'Do you want to come along to the show?'
June scrapes the money together for a babysitter
Tom's working late, she's glad she's on her own
Especially when Harry sings that song about the girl
By the lake and how the moonlight looked
The oldest story in the book
You get what you can
When things don't work out right
City life makes you grow up fast

To each their own
We somehow find a path
But feet get dirty on the way

Disappointment always
Rears its ugly head
Expensive habits
Expensive tastes
Lead you to bed
Sallie-Anne

Who do you trust
To do what you must do
No destination, but always on the loose
Temptations sake, you never make a stand
But I feel that I must rake up
This painful past
Sallie-Anne

They had their way
We all know that was true
But meeting in the park
Was a silly thing to do
Suspicion doesn't age
Nor memories of you
I've never been closer than a newspaper
But I feel for you
Sallie-Anne
Walter quit the RAF
When there was no good air left
Made it back to the clan
The dog, the wife, the betting slip wet in his hand
And no one's listening
To the boys
Tim, Jaimme and Gab
Keeping him up while his mistress rings his hands
Picked him up after school
Just make sure you're looking good
And no one's leaving

Walter plays
Get off your knees
Walter plays
Get off your knees

It's mini coke and prawns again
In his room or on the sand
Not a day before he fell
Propping up the bar at the Raffle's hotel
And no one' leaving

Walter plays
Get off your knees
Give the kids a hand
Down on the sand

No one's listening
Walter plays
Get off your knees
Give the kids a hand
Down on the sand

In the morning we wreck the bed
You bring me coffee black and boiling
Then we start up again
And the coffee goes cold

I wake up drinking from your lips
Kisses warm and tender
And I'd give up the world
Just to see you smile

One things I will never understand
(It's become my problem)
And it's something that's right out of my hands
(My hands are clean)

What makes such a sweet guy turn so mean?

I went to town with a moody man
A handsome Dr. Jekyll
He was right by my side
Turning into Mr. Hyde

I ran for cover, but I ran too slow
I was stitched by strangers
And they shook their heads
That someone could do the things you did

I must be mad, I must be crazy, everyone tells me so
Everyday I see it coming, now I'm facing the wall, waiting for the blow

In the morning you kiss my head
You say it was another
Now you're down on your knees
Begging me to forgive you please

I wake up aching from your touch
Every muscle tender
Then I look in your eyes, the way you smile
And I'm hypnotized

Short black hair makes her look so sweet
My baby's pretty from her head to her feet
She is my baby and I want you to know
I'm gonna keep her, 'cause I love her so
Because she's my baby, Gonna keep her for my own
She's my baby and I love her so
She's my baby, never let her go
She's my baby, and I need her so
Lovin' little honey won't you please be mine
Dark brown eyes and her lips so red
She is the only one can make me care
Now listen buddy, gonna let you know
She is my baby and I love her so
Because she's my baby, Gonna keep her for my own
She's my baby and I love her so
She's my baby, never let her go
She's my baby, and I need her so
Lovin' little honey won't you please be mine
Take a trip to Paris, even go to Spain
Go the whole world over, we'll go round again
There's nothing can compare with her, I'm glad to say
She's my little baby and she's here to stay
Because she's my baby, Gonna keep her for my own
She's my baby and I love her so
She's my baby, never let her go
She's my baby, and I need her so
Lovin' little honey won't you please be mine
Alright, I'm hot, Mmm hot, Yeah, (hot)

Working so hard like a mad man

Keep on writin' me, mama
Keep on sendin' me news

I started a joke which started the whole world crying
But I didn't see that the joke was on me oh no
I started to cry which started the whole world laughing
Oh If I'd only seen that the joke was on me

I looked at the skies running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed hurting my head from things that I said
'Till I finally died which started the whole world living
Oh if I'd only seen that the joke was on me

I looked at the skies running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed hurting my head from things that I said
'Till I finally died which started the whole world living
Oh if I'd only seen that the joke was on me
Oh no that the joke was on me

Mwah!

When you look at me tell me what do you see
This is what you get it's the way I am
When I look at you I wannabe I wannabe
Somewhere close to heaven with Neanderthal man
Don't go, I know you want to touch me
Here there and everywhere
Sparks fly when we are together
You can't deny the facts of liiiiiiife

You don't have to act like a star
Tryin' moves in the back your car
Don't you know that we can go far
Because tonight you gonna get my
Mwah! Mwah!
Don't play the games that you play
Cause You know that I won't run away
Why ain't you asking me to stay
Because tonight I'm gonna give you my
Mwah! Mwah!
(Uh!)

You could be my baby
What's your starsign?
Won't you take a step
Into the lion's den?
I can hear my conscience
Calling me, calling me
Say I'm gonna be a bad girl again
Why don't you come on over
We can't leave this all undone
Got the devil on my shoulder
There's no place for you to run

You don't have to act like a star
Tryin' moves in the back of your car
Don't you know that we can go far
Because tonight you gonna get my
Mwah! Mwah!
Don't play the games that you play
Cause You know that I won't run away
Why ain't you asking me to stay
Because tonight I'm gonna give you my
Mwah! Mwah!

If You lose your head

Sending you my kiss

Cause You know that I won't run away
Why ain't you asking me to stay
Because tonight I'm gonna give you my
I know that one day soon a song shall rise;
You'll hear it with the sleep still in your eyes
You'll waken to a brand new day
Can you hear bells ringin'
Voices singin'
Far away?

A time when every man will be as one
A time to reach right out and touch the sun
Come the day
Freedom's still a thought within your mind
The fleeting thing that some may never find
It may be still a million miles away
Can you hear bells ringin'
Voices singin'
Far away?

A time to live without doubt or fear
Welcome to the happy world that will be here
Come the day
The trumpets of war will cease to blow
The sound I hope that we may never know
We're waiting for the day
Can you hear bells ringin'
Voices singin'
Far away?

Lift up your voices and sing this song
Let the whole world hear it loud and strong
Can you hear bells ringin'
Voices singin'
Far away?
There's thunderclouds ahead
And peril on the shore
It takers a bell to wake the dead
So ring it hard once more

We swore to put things right
By the shadow of a lovers moon
Then you gave me back my sight
And not a moment too soon

This ain't no Lord's Day journey
There's no treasure or golden prize
I'm on the road to ruin
Carried by the light in your eyes

Black seas pitch and toss
'Til you're unsteady on your feet
When they raise that fiery cross
Together we'll share the heat

There's terror in the sky
The fury never stops
You carry me
We'll chart a steady course
No tears or remorse
You carry me

There's thunder in my head
The coast is ironbound
Now I remember what you said
It's like a hammer comin' down

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)

Everybody needs a little loving,
Everybody needs somebody thinking of them.
Everybody needs a little respect,
And whatever it takes,
I’m gonna get it.

Yesterdays
Yesterdays
Days I knew as happy sweet
Sequestered days
Olden days
Golden days
Days of mad romance and love
Then gay youth was mine
And truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Forsooth was mine
Sad am I
Glad am I
For today I'm dreaming of
Of yesterdays
Then gay youth was mine
The truth was mine
Sad am I
Glad am I
For today I'm dreaming of
Of yesterdays
The blue sky grows dark now;
You're gone, you're gone
The good times have gone with you;
You're gone
No use in me wishing; you're far, far away
Far away, away, gone from me
Our love knew two summers
But now you're gone
The days pass to winter;
You're gone
Yet often I've wished that time would stand still
Time would stand still, still; you're gone from me
Two summers, two winters
And the time between;
Yes, those were the good years
The years of gold and green
Two summers, two winters
And the time between;
Yes, those were the good years
The years of gold and green
The warm winds grow cold now;
You're gone, you're gone
My love couldn't hold you;
You're gone
You were wild as the wind and born to be free
Born to be free, free
And gone from me
And gone from me

Baby you say you gotta say goodbye
You tell me that you gotta go
But you don't wanna tell me why
And I wouldn't try to make you stay
Even though it hurts inside
I think you're better off this way
Just before your touch has turned to ice
Baby give me one more taste of paradise

Let's make it last all night
This could be the last time I make love to you
Let's make it last all night
Baby give me something to hold on to
Even if we can't make it right
Baby make it last all night

Baby before you throw it all away
Before goodbye is carved in stone
And then there's nothing left to say
Before you close the door on your desire
Baby give me one more chance to feel your fire

Let's make it last all night
This could be the last time I make love to you
Let's make it last all night
Baby give me something to hold on to
Even if we can't make it right
Baby make it last all night
Before your touch is turned to ice
Give me one more taste of paradise
Jodi just ran out of luck
Like you do when your plans come unstuck
Nothin' to lose the river so wide
Peace in the valley and tears for the bride

Lucy still sits there at home
There are things worse than drinkin' alone
He calls her sweetheart she wears his ring
But who can say which way love's gonna swing

Ride ride just let it ride
Keep it all locked up inside
Ride ride just let it ride
Save all your tears for the bride

They're tearin' the carnival down
Even strangers are welcome in town
Broken windows and rusted wire
Ain't enough fuel left to start a good fire

It's hard to know what to expect
When along the way lines disconnect
Hope for the weary and sight to the blind
But only one love of a kind

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)

Open up the door Astrid, cause I'm comin' down the stairs
And I ain't gonna listen to no more pissin' around
I've had seven long years of give a little, take a little
Stack a little money away
And you better believe I'm gonna take this love to town

Turn on the tears Astrid, and don't forget to let the neighbours see
What a low down deal you got when you married me
You can drown your days in valium and brandy
Talkin' to the cat and the dog
And you can shove your cheap french vogue society

Goodbye, goodbye . . 
I won't be comin' back for long

Open up the door Astrid, and don't try to stand in my way
I'm heading for a long long night to a better day
And don't bother offering to drive me to the station
You'd only drive me round the bend
We're comin' to the end, there's nothin' left to say

Ice will melt, water will boil
You and I can shake off this mortal coil
It's bigger than us
You don't have to worry about it
Ready or not, here comes the drop
You feel lucky when you know where you are
Y'know, it's gonna come true
Here in your arms, I remember

It's only natural
That I should want to be there with you
It's only natural
That you should feel the same way, too

It's easy when you don't try going on first impressions
Man in a cage has made his confession
Now, you've seen me at my worst
And it won't be the last time I'm down there
I want you to know I feel completely at ease
Read me like a book
That's fallen down between your knees
Please, let me have my way with you

It's only natural
That I should want to be there with you
It's only natural
That you should feel the same way, too

It's circumstantial
It's nothing written in the sky
And we don't even have to try
But we'll be shaking like mud
Buildings of glass
Sink into the bay
They'll be under the rocks again
You don't have to say
I know you're afraid

It's only natural
That I should want to be there with you
It's only natural
That you should feel the same way, too

[Outro]
It's circumstantial
It's something I was born to
It's only natural
Can I help it if I want to?
Can I help it if I want to?

I walk along right next to you
You seem to know just what to do
Your body tries to infiltrate
Our privacy it's hard to wait
Easy darling you can't ignore
All of the reasons that I love you for
The way we cook, the way you win
When you want to love me I just must give in.
Try not to break me baby you're so strong.
You mightn't think so but I know, you're so strong.
You picked me up and took me home
Straightened me out but didn't leave me alone
The way you hug the way you kiss
I don't know how much more I can take of this.
Try not to break me baby you're so strong.
You mightn't think so but I know, you're so strong.
I walk along right next to you
You seem to know just what to do
Your body tries to infiltrate
Our privacy it's hard to wait

I don't know how much more I can take of this.
Try not to break me baby you're so strong.

Try not to break me baby
Try not to break me baby YOU'RE SO STRONG.

Gather round people let me tell you're a story
An eight year long story of power and pride
British Lord Vestey and Vincent Lingiarri
Were opposite men on opposite sides 

Vestey was fat with money and muscle
Beef was his business, broad was his door
Vincent was lean and spoke very little
He had no bank balance, hard dirt was his floor 

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow 

Gurindji were working for nothing but rations
Where once they had gathered the wealth of the land
Daily the pressure got tighter and tighter
Gurindju decided they must make a stand 

They picked up their swags and started off walking
At Wattie Creek they sat themselves down
Now it don't sound like much but it sure got tongues talking
Back at the homestead and then in the town 

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow 

Vestey man said I'll double your wages
Seven quid a week you'll have in your hand
Vincent said uhuh we're not talking about wages
We're sitting right here till we get our land
Vestey man roared and Vestey man thundered
You don't stand the chance of a cinder in snow
Vince said if we fall others are rising 

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow 

Then Vincent Lingiarri boarded an aeroplane
Landed in Sydney, big city of lights
And daily he went round softly speaking his story
To all kinds of men from all walks of life 

And Vincent sat down with big politicians
This affair they told him is a matter of state
Let us sort it out, your people are hungry
Vincent said no thanks, we know how to wait 

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow 

Then Vincent Lingiarri returned in an aeroplane
Back to his country once more to sit down
And he told his people let the stars keep on turning
We have friends in the south, in the cities and towns 

Eight years went by, eight long years of waiting
Till one day a tall stranger appeared in the land
And he came with lawyers and he came with great ceremony
And through Vincent's fingers poured a handful of sand 

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow 

That was the story of Vincent Lingairri
But this is the story of something much more
How power and privilege can not move a people
Who know where they stand and stand in the law 

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow
Harley and Rose were reunited
This time they said it was for real
She'd take him back to where it started
He would melt her heart of steel
Life is a bitter disappointment
She would hear-ear young Harley say
If you find something more important
I will not stand in your way

Like static on the dial, a look comes back in style
Harley and Rose, they just lost it for a while
Harley claimed there was no lover
Nothin' blooms this time of year
While Rose was thinkin' of another
She did not see him disappear

Like static on the dial, a look comes back in style
Harley and Rose, they just lost it for a while
Like tumblin' down the aisle, a half forgotten smile
Harley and Rose, they just lost it for a while

You know we all can change direction
Ain't nothin' to it, just relax
He adds one more to his collectio-ion
She strikes another useless match

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah

Like tumblin' down the aisle, a half forgotten smile
Harley and Rose, they just lost it for a while
Harley was dreamin' of his funeral
As customary, he was late
But just in time to see young Rosie
Lay her flowers at the gate

Like static on the dial, a look comes back in style
Harley and Rose, they just lost it for a while
Like tumblin' down the aisle, a half forgotten smile
Harley and Rose, they just lost it for a while

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah

Love is in you, love is on their side
They just lost it for a while
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Convict state
It just don't rate
He want to get higher
Apple Isle, the inbred smile
He's going to get by'a
His mother's hand
He could not stand
He left for the islands
To fish and hunt
He take a punt
The New Guinea Highlands

Ohhh Errol
I would give everything just to be like him

He had to go
The Sirocco
He's sailin the high seas
Hollywood, Captain Blood
He's billing the Nazi's
Took a rebel stand
Contraband
Coast of Mexico
He want to pounce
Like an animal
To girls he just can't say no

Ohhh Errol
I would give everything just to be like him(x2)

He had them all
Screamin for more
He play the wild scene
Ah scandalise, no compromise
He's down on his knees
Swashbuckling
He was the King
The toast of Tinseltown
They build him up
They took it all
And then they just cut him down

Ohhh Errol
I would give everything just to be like him(x2)

Dont tell me its true
I dont wanna hear about it (4x)

Ohhh Errol
I would give everything just to be like him(4x)
Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something

People on their own are getting nowhere
I'm on the road to see
If anything is anywhere or waiting, just for me

Everynight I walk around the city
Seems like I'll never know
That feeling of being together when I go

And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going

Hey, everybody, don't you feel that there's something
But you know in a moment it is gone
I live for the day when I can hear people saying
That they know and they care for everyone

But I feel like I've been here for the whole of my life
Never knowing home

It's a long way, it's a long, long, long way there
I'm gonna keep on tryin', I'm gonna keep on tryin', yeah
I'm gonna keep on tryin', keep on tryin'

Been away from home for such a long time
And got to know this town
But I don't seem to matter much to anyone who's around
Is there anybody around

Everynight I walk around the city
Seems like I'll never know
The feeling of being together when I go

And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going

Everybody knows it's a long way there
Oh, everybody knows it's a long way there
Mmm, it's a long way

Driving around's kind of getting me down and I know, and I know
It's a long long way there
It's such a long long way, long way

Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something
Feel it, feel it
Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something

Ooh, watching me 
Hanging by 
A string this time 
Don't, easily 
The climax 
Of the perfect lie 
Ooh, watching me 
Hanging by 
A string this time 
Don't, easily 
Smile worth 
A hundred lies 

If there's lessons 
To be learned 
I'd rather get 
My jamming words 
In first, so 
Tell you something 
That I've found 
That the world's 
A better place 
When it's 
Upside down, boy 

If there's lessons 
To be learned 
I'd rather get 
My jamming words 
In first, so 
When your playing 
With desire 
Don't come running 
To my place 
When it burns 
Like fire, boy 

Sweet about me 
Nothing sweet 
About me, yeah 

Blue, blue, blue 
Waves, they crash 
As time goes by 
So hard to catch 
Too, too smooth 
Ain't all that 
Why don't you ride 
On my side 
Of the tracks 

If there's lessons 
To be learned 
I'd rather get 
My jamming words 
In first, so 
Tell you something 
That I've found 
That the world's 
A better place 
When it's 
Upside down, boy 

If there's lessons 
To be learned 
I'd rather get 
My jamming words 
In first, so 
When your playing 
With desire 
Don't come running 
To my place 
When it burns 
Like fire, boy 

when all you want to do is rock
but you don’t want to bear the sock no more
when it’s just sweat that fills your eyes
Belated feelings that you have denied

when every wolf is at your door
just like a hundred times before
but you don’t want to leave the end

cause you was amazing
and we did amazing things
and I wouldn't change it
cause we were amazing things

rebuilding bridges in your mind
your eagerness now is on the line
the plastic mountain at your feet
divided streets now as you look to find a seat

when every wolf is at your door
just like a hundred times before
but you don’t want to see the end

you was amazing
and we did amazing things
and I wouldn’t change it
cause we were amazing things

and I really didn’t want that push today
no I really didn’t want to end this way
but the things that seem to bind us
are the things we put behind us on this day

you was amazing
and we did amazing things
and I wouldn't change it
cause we were amazing things

I feel your heart
Its beating time with mine
You thought love
Love, love was on the line
He holds you down
But I know you want to run
But youre hot, hot
Loaded like a gun
Oh you feel oh so trapped and confused
Start with nothing, you got nothing to lose

You can never, never, never, ever, never, never, never, ever
Hide your heart
Dont ever, ever, ever, ever try
If you dont give your heart wings
Youll never, never, never ever never, never, never ever
Fly

Break down the walls
Well youve got to cut the ties
Well theres pain, pain burning in your eyes
Its time to fight
Well its time for tearing free
Well come, come runnin straight to me

Well you know he dont love you like I do
Dont make believe that you dont feel it too

You can never, never, never ever never, never, never ever
Hide your heart
Dont ever, ever, ever, ever try
Whoa oh no
If u dont give your heart wings
Youll never, never, never, never 
Fly

Youll never fly
If u want u can fly
I'm just a shy romantic with my eyes on the loose
I'm in a overcoated way
A poet in a garret
You know what people say
Standing at the barline with my lip on the curl
I'm with the other lean and lear
My finger on the pulse
And my hand around a beer

Ah, Ahh, well I don't wanna know what's going round here
Ah, Ahh, it's just a matter of time, hold it under light
Ah, Ahh, I've got to get away, to get away, to get away

The singer in the band, he sweat on a pose
And he's really such a jerk
Thinks he can call me stupid
Because he gets a lot of work
I'm standing in the background, got my arms on the fold
And every dog's gonna have it's day
The New Musical Express and my own 4-way P.A

Well, I've been reading those biographies in paperback
I've got a death-wish that I can't explain
I've been working on that petulance
And the urchin took my name

Ah, Ahh, well I don't wanna know what's going round here
Ah, Ahh, it's just a matter of time, hold it under light
Ah, Ahh, I've got to get away, to get away, to get away
I'll be there to catch you in a taxi, honey
Better be ready 'bout half past eight
Now baby, don't be late
I wanna be there when the band start playing

Remember when we get there, honey
Two-step, I'm gonna have them all
Gonna dance out of both of my shoes
When they play the 'Jelly Roll Blue'
Tomorrow night at the Darktown Strutter's Ball

I'll be there to catch you in a taxi, honey
Better be ready 'bout half past eight
Now baby, don't be late
I wanna be there when the band start playing

Remember when we get there, honey
Two-step, I'm gonna have them all
Gonna dance out of both of my shoes
When they play the 'Jelly Roll Blue'
Tomorrow night at the Darktown Strutter's Ball
Just layin' with my lady on a houseboat in the sun
Can't hear the city hummin', and I'm feelin' good
With a belly full of oysters and some white wine on the ice
I've got that laid back lovin' feeling - it's really nice
What I call Hawkesbury River lovin', good Aussie wine
Workin' hard at bein' lazy, no bait on the line
My kind of paradise, a river honeymoon
Just layin' with my lady on a houseboat in the sun

Well I know I should be out there. . .searchin' for a job. . 
I could try a pick 'n shovel. . .but what the hell. . 
Why can't I be born again and come back as a swan. . 
Head up north for the winter. . .and back again. . .to find some

Hawkesbury River Lovin', good Aussie wine
Workin' hard at bein' lazy, no bait on the line
My kind of paradise, a river honeymoon
Just layin' with my lady on a houseboat in the sun

And I know you don't mind how many times I say 'I love you'
As long as you can stay around for more

What I call Hawkesbury River Lovin', good Aussie wine
Workin' hard at bein' lazy, no bait on the line
My kind of paradise, a river honeymoon
Just layin' with my lady on a houseboat in the sun

Layin' with my lady on a houseboat in the sun...
Time is an ocean draggin' us down
Hold on tight dear children
Death is a king who shares his crown
Pray through the night dear children

Lay down your arms
Strike up the band
Faith in your hearts
Blood on your hands

Truth is a razor gleamin' and sharp
Open your eyes dear children
Send me your kisses alone in the dark
Say your goodbyes dear children

Brothers and sisters
You've already saved
There's fire on the mountain
A black rose on your grave
I got some money in my pocket, I got the car keys in my hand
I got myself a couple of tickets, to see a rock'n rollin' band
Come on girl just get on your shoes, we're gonna hear some sounds
Come on babe you know there ain't no time to mess around-round-round....
Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie - let your hair hang down
You got the body of a woman, the way you move it like a queen
You got the face to raise a riot, and still you're only seventeen
But little girl you're oh so shy, you hardly make a sound
Come on babe you know there ain't no time to mess around-round-round...
Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie - let your hair hang down
Aaaahhhhhhh
So won't you try it baby, I'll take you by the hand
'Cause there's a world out there for you, you're goin' to understand
You've got the chance so take it, you've just gotta pick and choose
Why don't you give it just one try, I know you can't lose
The body of a woman, you nearly make me lose my breathe
You know you give me such a feeling, you almost scare me half to death ow!
But little girl you're so reserved, you hardly make a sound
Come on baby, don't you be so shy, don't mess around (round, round, round, round)
Ow, Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Evie (yeah), Evie, Evie let your hair hang down (Aaaahhh)
Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie - let your hair hang down
Let your hair hang down, let your hair hang down..(fade to end)
Backgroud:
(Come on baby, there's a world out there for me and you to share. Try it girl, let your hair hang down)
Well well well who's that a calling
Well well well hold my hand
Well well well night is a falling
Spirit is a-moving all over this land

God told Noah build him an ark
Build it out of hickory bark
Rain started falling waters start to climb
God said a fire not a flood next time

Well well well who's that a calling
Well well well hold my hand
Well well well night is a falling
Spirit is a-moving all over this land

The Lord said fire come on Judgement Day
All mankind's gonna pass away
Brothers and sisters don't you know
You gotta reap just what you sow

Well well well who's that a calling
Well well well hold my hand
Well well well night is a falling
Spirit is a-moving all over this land

Well well well who's that a calling
Well well well hold my hand
Well well well night is a falling
Spirit is a-moving all over this land

Well well well
Straight to the bottom
Of the deepest black sea
High on a cargo of bootleg diesoline
Don't need no morning star
To guide me back to shore
Burn all my blankets
I won't be home no more

You might need a witness
Let some angel testify
Burnin' from the kisses
Of thousand long goodbye
The heat is shimmerin'
It's time to throw the switch
Send off a beacon
There's panic on the bridge

Waves above us
Fire down below
Last chance to roll
That Memphis domino
Those tanks are gonna blow

Break down the hatches
There's a riot goin' on
Someone's screamin' murder
But the killer's long gone
Creepin' round the cabin
On your tattooed hands and knees
Tastes like the cure
But hooks like a disease

Can't see those harbour lights
No streets to roam
Burn all my blankets
I won't be comin' home
Straight to the fire down below

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)
I see headlights burn
As we go down over the river
And I hope so hard
With visions full of you

All along the weekend
Another overnighter
Then it's time for you to go
And me to follow through

Cause I'm waiting for Sunday
And I hear the wind blow

I see people fall
And the memory makes me shiver
Remind me again
Myself I will deliver

Cause I'm waiting for Sunday
And I hear the wind blow
Come up and see me
The faraway man
The faraway man

You and me and the tribe
We all belong together
Sunday is coming
But the weeks go on forever

And I was lost for words
In your arms
Attempting to make sense
Of my aching heart
If I could just be
Everything and everyone to you
This life would just be so easy 

Not enough time for all
That I want for you
Not enough time for every kiss
And every touch and all the nights
I wanna be beside you 

We will make time stop
For the two of us
Make time stop
And listen for our sighs 

Not enough time for all
That I want for you
Not enough time for every kiss
And every touch and all the nights
I wanna be inside you 

In our fight against the end
Making love we are immortal
We are the last two left on earth
And I was lost for words
In your arms
Attempting to make sense
Of my aching heart
If I could just be everything
And everyone to you 

Not enough time for all
That I want to you
Not enough time for every kiss
Not enough time for all my love
Not enough time for every touch 

Not enough time for all
That I want to you
Not enough time for every kiss
And every touch and all the nights
You gotta love this city, love this city, you gotta love this city
You gotta love this city, love this city, you gotta love this city

Too sick for breakfast, the car wouldn't start
The train was really full, and his girlfriend had a boyfriend
The houses all the same, now here's the rain
Not falling but collapsing at his feet
Deep breath and he clocks on, raincoat on his arm
He wishes the hours would disappear

But the trip's in vain 'cause awaiting him
A lay-off notice and his severance pay
He shuffles back to the train again
You gotta love this city

You gotta love this city, love this city, you gotta love this city
You gotta love this city, love this city, you gotta love this city

Back home he lies in bed for days and days
Watching American television, smoking
And playing with himself ringing double-O double-5
Into town on Thursday night
The girls are pretty and the lights are bright
At least he loves his city

Holding court on Taylor Square proper was the man he could become
Lear's Fool is a bum now
With seven holy parcels by his side

You gotta love this city, love this city, you gotta love this city
You gotta love this city, love this city, you gotta love this city

He walks along the foreshore, he's got a bottle
And he's breathing with his city

It was busy everywhere he went
There was a crowd over the bay
And a fireworks display
It's all very strange for a Thursday night thought he
Then it dawns on him as a cracker explodes
And who the hell is he going to blame?
It dawns on him - the horror - we got the Olympic Games

You gotta love this city for its body and not its brain

And he screams "My city is a whore, opened herself to the world
Jumped up and down in pastel shirts
And lathered up thinking about designs for T-shirts"

You gotta love this city for its body and not its brain

It's more than he can take, and the stars' reflection breaks
'Cause you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it enjoy the view
You gotta love this city
He's had enough and he sinks to the bottom
Down in the deep
Two brave mariners sleep
Sons of the sea
Comrades in arms
With renegade charms
Forever free
No matter what cost, storms never tossed up a rivalry
Brothers in blood through fire and flood, ice and ivory
Beat the drum, fight back the tears in your eyes
High seas come, take the best years of our lives
Winds sing the tale
The pair put to sail
Bound for the cape
Caught in a swell
Sent from Lucifer's hell
No great escape
Trapped below decks
Up to their necks
Heroes just laugh at the sea
Down with all hands
Wrecked in the sands of eternity

Ah yeah, let me tell you all about it
I've been thinkin about you night and day
Sure been restless since you went away
You took something from me against my will
Touched a nerve in me thats tingling still
You just snuck up behind me
When my resistance was low
And nows a hell of a time to find i can't let you go
Got your first letter just the other day
Since i got it i can't put it away
I just sit and read it over and over and over again
As if the words that you wrote could bring this hurt to an end

Well you just left me here waiting
Left a wound that won't heal
God your so far away you don't know how i feel
So say you'll take a chance on this heart of mine
Don't make me the one that you left behind
And i'm not saying anybody's wrong or right
Just know i'd die to be with you tonight

I count the hours each time till your gone
I don't have to let you leave me
It makes no sense at all
If i have to follow you all around the world
I'd be willing to do anything to get to you girl

You just left me here waitin
Left a wound that won't heal
God your so far away you don't know how i feel
So say you'll take a chance on this heart of mine
Don't make me the one that you left behind
And i'm not saying anybody's wrong or right
Just know i'd die to be with you tonight
Ah yeah

So say you'll take a chance on this heart of mine
Don't make me the one that you left behind
I'm not saying anybody's wrong or right
Just know i'd die to be with you tonight
You just left me here waitin
My resistance was low
And nows a hell of a time to find i can't let you go
So say you'll take a chance on this heart of mine
Don't make me the one that you left behind
I'm not saying anybody's wrong or right
Just know i'd die to be with you tonight

Oh
I'd die to be with you tonight
I'd die to be with you tonight

I count the hours each time that your gone
Oh
I'd die to be with you tonight
I don't have to let you leave me
It makes no sense at all
I'd die to be with you tonight
I'd die to be with you
I'd die to be with you tonight
I'd die to be with you
I'd die to be with you tonight
I'd die to be with you
To hear your voice, to see you smile
To sit and talk to you awhile
To be together the same old way
That would be our greatest wish today

To hear you laugh, to hear you cry
Or just a chance to say 'goodbye'
To say the things we didn't say
That would be our greatest wish today

But all we can do is throw a flower on the water
Look for the sun through the rain
Lay a little frangipani gentle on the water
Remember how we loved you

To comb your hair, to lace your shoes
Buy some flowers, let you choose
A phone call when you're away
Just to see if you're okay
Come on confess your confusion
Spread it around
They trickle down your cheeks tears fall
Like seed on barren ground
Your thoughts are scattered
Like paper everywhere
Tiny pieces of laughter and despair

But you cry true tears of joy

Passion is your weakness
But you feed it everyday
Like a moth to the naked falme
You just can't keep away
You twist the truth, then you turn the other cheek
Everybody knows its just salvation that you seek

And you cry true tears of joy
Oh you cry true tears of joy
Oh yeah

It flickers on your face
I can see it in your eyes
I knew you for a moment
So don't be so suprised
Its only pleasure that you can't resist
But say one word of truth

And I'll see you cry true tears of joy
Oh you cry true tears of joy
Yeah you cry true tears of joy
Oh you cry true tears of joy
Oh yeah

Tears of joy
We will fly
Way up high
Where the cold wind blows
Or in the sun
Laughing having fun
With the people that she knows
And if the situation
Should keep us separated
You know the world won't fall apart
And you will free the beautiful bird
That's caught inside your heart
Can't you hear her?
Oh she cries so loud
Casts her wild note
Over water and cloud
That's the way it's gonna be, little darlin'
We'll be riding on the horses, yeah
Way up in the sky, little darlin'
And if you fall I'll pick you up, pick you up

You will grow
And until you go
I'll be right there by your side
And even then
Whisper the wind
And she will carry up your ride
I hear all the people of the world
In one bird's lonely cry
See them trying every way they know how
To make their spirit fly
Can't you see him?
He's down on the ground
He has a broken wing
Looking all around

That's the way it's gonna be, little darlin'
You go riding on the horses, yeah
Way up in the sky, little darlin'
And if you fall I'll pick you up, pick you up
Can't you hear her?
Oh she cries so loud
Casts her wild note
Over water and cloud
I'll pick you up darlin' if you fall
Don't worry 'bout a thing little girl
Because I was young myself not so long ago
And when I was young
When I was young
And when I was young, oh I was a wild, wild one.
She paints pictures on the wall
She eats all of the garden
And has an aversion to conviction
And she calls her dog "the bear"

In love with this girl
And with her town as well
Walking 'round the rainy city
What a pity there's things to do at home

She paints pictures on the wall
I awake to see the feelings
From the night before
She eats all of the garden, it's a jungle out there
And we won't return by dawn

If I had three lives
I'd marry her in two
I'm dreaming of a time
That we sit when the music stops

She has an aversion to conviction
She's more confused than ever
Won't pay her fines and wonders when the cops will get her
She calls her dog "the bear"
And walks me with him to the corner
In her pyjamas

There's a bastard called the economy and it keeps poor people poor
While the fat cats with the money go on making more and more
They've wrapped him in bandages to hide his gaping sores
So we can't see that he's just rotten to the core
Oh they've pumped him with medicine perscribed by good old Dr Case
No matter what they do we all get ripped off just the same

The liberals slugged us twenty-three years until we'd had enough
Everyone got sick of them so brought in uncle Gough
Then he got sacked now Malcolm's back
The neighbour of Nareen
Got the biggest election that Tammy's ever seen
Oh it doesn't matter who's in power cause it's a crooked game
It's a sure bet we will all get ripped off just the same

The economy's a mad machine which noone can control
Fat cats fight for the driver's seat but the steering wheel's been sold
To the yanks and other foreigners who'll give it a dizzy spin
Any time they feel their ripped off pockets getting thin
Oh a little touch of makeup it's such a goddamn shame
It's a sure bet we will all get ripped off just the same

Oh there's no two ways about it if we all don't force a change
It goes on and on and we get ripped off just the same
Oh there once was a swagman camped in a billabong
Under the shade of a coolibah tree
And he sang as he looked at his old billy boiling
Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Who'll come a waltzing Matilda my darling
Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
Waltzing Matilda and leading a water bag
Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Down came a jumbuck to drink at the water hole
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee
And he sang as he stowed him away in his tucker bag

You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Down came the squatter a riding on his thoroughbred
Down came the troopers one two three
Whose is that jumbuck you've got in the tucker bag
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

But the swagman he up and he jumped into the water hole
Drowning himself by the coolibah tree
And his ghost may be heard as it sings in the billabong
Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Four letter word, four letter word
Four letter word, four letter word

You make me wanna sing to you, ah oh
Yeah, it's the little things you do for me, homie, lover, friend
I can spend my life with you, ah oh
Yeah girl, we ain't gotta thing to lose so, let's go and runaway

It's you and me, never gotta worry
'Cause we always got each other
Like the moon to the sea
Girl, you got me feeling your way

You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter
You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word

Four letter, four letter word you can be anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
'Cause you're my four letter word, four letter word
And I'm your four letter word, whoa

To be loved, to be loved, what a feeling, it's a drug
I'ma addicted to ya hugs and ya kisses and ya ah
No matter who's around I show affection
Walk you on the inside of the sidewalk for protection

I need a moment to take it all in, feel so surreal, don't it
When you need me call me, I will never leave you lonely
And I think that's it corny to just call you my angel
You're my Aaliyah, this letter is almost four pages

See my parents and your parents don't agree
They think our love is temporary 'cause we only teens
But not too many get it right on the first try
And I'm feeling so right for the first time

You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word
You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word

Four letter, four letter word, you can be anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
'Cause you're my four letter word, four letter word
And I'm your four letter word, whoa

I don't wanna hear a love song 'cause I live it
Every moments memorable we'll never forget it
Love the way you pucker up your lips when I peck it
When you get this message I'll be right here when you check it

My heart, my mind, my soul, my time
It's all for you, let me say it one more time
My heart, my mind, my soul, my time
It's all for you underscore bottom line

You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word
You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word

You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word
You're my four letter word, four letter word
My four letter word, four letter word
Love, you're my four letter word, love

When I walk down the streets
See the people who stop and stare and say
Haven't I seen that face somewhere a long time ago
When I walk down the streets
See the stranger who says 'why, hi'
With a 'how you goin', buddy'
When you walked on by I thought I'd say hallo

They say: haven't I seen your face before
Weren't you the boy that used to live next door
Weren't you on television every night
Haven't I seen you round

Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero, that's all I'll be
Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
And yesterday's hero is all that I'm gonna be if I don't get together
Make a new start and be somebody better
All that I'll be if I don't get together now

When you walk down the streets
If you know me, then pass me by
If you wonder what I'm doing
Don't ask me why I don't read the news
When you walk down the streets
If you're sorry then don't feel bad
If you followed my story
Then just be glad you ain't in my shoes

Because haven't you seen my face before
Yes, I was the boy who used to live next door
Yes, I was on television every night
Haven't you seen me round

Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero, that's all I'll be
Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
And yesterday's hero is all that I'm gonna be if I don't get together
Make a new start and be somebody better
All that I'll be if I don't get together now

Yesterday's hero, yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero, yesterday's hero

Never before have I seen you look so blue
I can't find a cure and nothing comforts you
But the light at the end of the tunnel
Doesn't shine at the end of the day

Every time you cry
Save up all your tears
I will be your rainbow when it disappears
Wash away the pain
'Til you smile again
I will be the laughter in your eyes
Every time you cry

Time has a way of wounding what has healed
What can I say? I know just how you feel
Your soul is dark and troubled
Like a river running wild

Every time you cry
Save up all your tears
I will be your rainbow when it disappears
Wash away the pain
'Til you smile again
I will be the one who dries your eyes
Every time you cry

Well, you know that's what I'm here for
I will give you what you need, more
There will be no hesitation
I will reap no reward

Every time you cry
Save up all your tears
I will be your rainbow when it disappears
Wash away the pain
'Til you smile again
I will be the one who dries your eyes
Every time you cry
Slip into a cinema and give yourself a treat
Better take a raincoat could be sticky on the seat
Open up you Twisties and open up your fly
Pictures start to flicker as your hand moves down your thigh

If your mother knew what you were doing
She'd probably hang her head and cry
And if she thought that you were whipping the dripping
She'd give you a belt, extract all the teeth of your fly

Munchy Munchy Twisties the shorts are such a drag
Make a little opening in the other end of your bag
Now put your Twisties right down there in your lap
No-one ever guesses your whatsit's in the pack

If your mother knew what you were doing...etc

Ooh la la la la la la la la...etc

Better get a grip on yourself
You better pull yourself together..

Picture's almost over but still your not quite there
John Wayne pulls his gun out and you wish he'd some to spare
Then they turn the lights on and people start to stare
You find you've got a boot full and your coat's stuck to the chair

If your mother knew what you were doing...etc

Ooh la la la la la la la la...etc

Hey, What's The Matter With You? (G.Macainsh)
Hey, what's the matter, what's the matter with you
Hey, what's the matter, what's the matter with you
I'm askin' you, I'm askin' you

You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't have your cake and eat it too
I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you

You can't have your dope and smoke it too
You can't have your dope and smoke it too
I'm tokin' you, I'm tokin' you

Hey, what's the matter, what's the matter with you
Hey, what's the matter, what's the matter with you
I'm askin' you, I'm askin' you

One shot in a revolution
One drop from a poison pen
One fruit too small and bitter
One tree too proud to bend

One man to start the trouble
One kiss to seal your fate
One kid that needs some action
One link in a chain reaction!

I got a fever, oh, a fever in my soul
No I don't want to die, before I get old
It took some time just to bring me here
Nobody's gonna put me down, do I make myself clear?

One shot in a revolution
One drop from a poison pen
One fruit too small and bitter
One tree too proud to bend

One man to start the trouble
One kiss to seal your fate
One kid that needs some action
One link in a chain reaction!

I've got trouble, oh, trouble in my life
And I've been living on the edge of a knife
But I don't intend to let you down
I'm gonna give you love before I hit the ground

One cruel and callous lover
One blow below the belt
One chance without another
One heart too cool to melt

One link in a chain reaction
One link in a chain reaction!

Woah...

One shot in a revolution
One drop from a poison pen
One fruit too small and bitter
One tree too proud to bend

One man to start the trouble
One kiss to seal your fate
One kid that needs some action
One link in a chain reaction!

If I were a minstrel I'd sing you six love songs
To tell the whole world of the love that we share
If I were a merchant I'd bring you six diamonds
With six blood red roses for my love to wear

But I am a simple man, a poor common farmer
So take my six ribbons to tie back your hair

If I were a nobleman I'd bring you six carriages
And six snow white horses to take you anywhere
If I were the emperor I'd build you six palaces
With six hundred servants for comforting fare

But I am a simple man, a poor common farmer
So take my six ribbons to tie back your hair

If I were a minstrel I'd sing you six love songs
To tell the whole world of the love that we share
So be not afraid love, you're never alone love
While you wear my ribbons to tie back your hair

Once I was a simple man, a poor common farmer
I gave you six ribbons to tie back your hair

Too-ra-lee, too-ra-lie, all I can share
Is only six ribbons to tie back your hair

[Energy never dies, just changes form]
[?]
[It is impossible to achieve the aim without suffering]

The sea calls me to the end of the pier
The sky is clear
So is the ending
The termination
In this moment of realisation

I have a vision of a very calming place
Where we fall like lovers into embrace
[?]

We fall like mist on mountains
Sensibilities lost
Like meteors from heaven
A stone in water

I have a vision of a very calming place
Where we fall like lovers into embrace

[Energy, all the time changes form]
[The time is now]
[?]
[I’m going to count from 1 to 3
And when I count the number 3
Your feet will be planted on the ground
And you will be pulled by that silver white cord
1, 2, 3!]

I have a vision of a very calming place
Where we fall like lovers
I have a vision of a very calming place
Where we fall like lovers into embrace

[Outro]

In the event of something happening to me,
There is something I would like you all to see.
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew.

Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones.

I keep straining my ears to hear a sound.
Maybe someone is digging underground,
Or have they given up and all gone home to bed,
Thinking those who once existed must be dead.

Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones.

Love can make you weep
Can make you run for cover
Roots that spread so deep
Bring life to frozen ground

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

Turning in my sleep
Love can leave you cold
A taste of jealousy
Is like a lust for gold

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

I've been
Feeling so much older
Frame me
And hang me on the wall
I've seen
You fall into the same trap
This thing
Is happening to us all

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

Something so strong
Something so strong
Something so strong
Something, something so strong
I'm into cattle, my Father was too
From Great Great Grandfather all the way through
And we scarcely have wasted an hour of daylight
Stickin' to Herefords and it's been all right
Prepared for the lean times and save for a drought
But you can't always plan how the future turns out
Life's gettin' harder to make what we need
With low cattle prices and more mouths to feed

Oh, six generations where camels run free
I hope I am never too blind to see
How fortunate, how proud can an old fella be
Three sons in their swags 'round the stock camp with me

Sent the boys off to school to see Adelaide
How other folks live, get a job learn a trade
Couldn't keep them away 'cause their hearts are still here
My butcher, my welder, my diesel engineer

Oh, six generations where camels run free
I hope I am never too blind to see
How fortunate, how proud can an old fella be
Three sons in their swags 'round the stock camp with me

And I come in for dinner, the sun hits the range
In a matter of seconds the colours all change
From gold down to violet the soul has been burned
And I understand fully why they have returned

Cause I'm into cattle, my Father was too
From Great Great Grandfather all the way through
And we've never been guilty of wasting daylight
We work hard, we play hard and we sleep well at night

Oh, six generations where camels run free
I hope I am never too blind to see
How fortunate, how proud can an old fella be
Three sons in their swags 'round the stock camp with me
Three sons in their swags 'round the stock camp with me
you opened up your door
I couldn't believe my luck
you in your new blue dress
taking away my breath
the cradle is soft and warm
couldn't do me no harm
you're showing me how to give

into temptation
knowing full well the earth will rebel
into temptation
a muddle of nervous words

could never amount to betrayal
the sentence is all my own
the price is to watch it fail
as I turn to go
you looked at me for half a second
with an open invitation
for me to go

into temptation
knowing full well the earth will rebel
into temptation
safe in the wide open arms of hell

we can go sailing in
climb down, lose yourself when you linger long
into temptation
right where you belong
the guilty get no sleep

in the last slow hours of morning
experience is cheap
I should've listened to the warning
but the cradle is soft and warm

into temptation
knowing full well the earth will rebel
into your wide open arms
no way to break the spell

break this spell
don't tell

Charlie was a driver and he hardly spent a night at home
He never saw his family, trucking loads those long weeks on the road, oh
And Charlie would drive (and Charlie would drive)
For miles and miles (for miles and miles)
Alone, whoa

Charlie had a teenage daughter he thought of as a little girl
But one day he came home his little girl had grown-up news to tell, well
Oh, Daddy, she cried (oh, Daddy, she cried)
Oh, Daddy, I tried (oh, Daddy, I tried)
But on the hayride how I fell
That was a hayride bound for Hell

Now, Billy Jackson was the father but he wasn't man enough to own
And his daddy was the mayor who told Charlie
Don't you leave my Billy-boy alone?
Billy had to hide (Billy had to hide)
There was guilt inside (there was guilt inside)
And you canıt hide from yourself
That's just a hayride bound for Hell (Hell)

Hell

Charlie's daughter died whilst giving birth to Billy Jackson's child
And Billy Jackson ain't been seen around these parts for quite a while

And Charlie would drive (and Charlie would drive)
For miles and miles (for miles and miles)
And his tail lights say farewell
Just like a hayride bound for
And his tail lights, they say farewell
He's a hayride bound for Hell
Bound for Hell (Hell)
He's bound for Hell

As she crosses the floor she knows
(What does she know?)
She's seen it before and she goes
(Where does she go)
There she stood
This fancy fashion creature
And everybody knows
She is my little senorita

Because I fell in love
With a modern girl
Fell in love
With a modern girl
With a modern girl

As she crosses the street where she lives
(Where does she live)
Nobody knows what she gives
(What does she give)
Where she walks
The hands reach out to greet her
And no one seems to understand
My little senorita

Well, I fell in love
With a modern girl
Fell in love
With a modern girl
With a modern girl

As she crosses the floor she knows
(What does she know?)
She's seen it before and she goes
(Where does she go)

There she stood
This fancy fashion creature
And everybody knows
She is my little senorita
Because I fell in love
With a modern girl
Fell in love

When I was just a little boy
I asked my mother, what will I be
Will I be happy, will I be rich
Here's what she said to me

Que Sera, Sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera
What will be, will be

When I was just a little brat,i asked my teacher
What will i be?
Will i be a mess, will i have success
This is what she said to me

Que Sera, Sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera
What will be, will be

When i grew up and fell in love
I asked my darlin' what should we be?
Will i be happy, will you be sad?
This is what you said to me

Que Sera, Sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera
What will be, will be

Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times

Too many times I've seen the sun come up through bloodshot eyes this week
No matter what I do since we broke up I find it hard to sleep

The room is spinning from too many drinks I've drunken by myself
I know that staying here and drinking beer is no good for my health

What is there left to do
But to drink and watch the view
I think that it might rain this afternoon

Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times

The doctor that I went to couldn't do any good
He gave me pills for sleeping
I took more than I should, than I should

Too many times I've seen the sun come up through bloodshot eyes this week
No matter what I do since we broke up I find it hard to sleep

What is there left to do
But to drink and watch the view
I think that it might rain this afternoon

Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Backwater bride white leather hide
Head soaked in mud and gin
Cold rusted moon hell fire lagoon
Set for a masterpiece of sin

Daughters of glory
In outlaw lands
Sweet surrender
With a rifle in your hands
Sons of sorrow
Weep and wail
Six ways from sunday
And the devil on your tail

Freight whistle blows red diamond rose
Sapphire and altarstone
Snake poison eyes
Low vermin lies
All down on flesh and bone

Who took your measurements?
From your toes to the top of your head
Yea, you know
Who bought you clothes and new shoes
And wrote you a book you never read
Yea, you know

Who was it, yeah you know, we real cool
On the far side of the morning,
Who was it, yeah you know, we real cool
Now I hope you're listening, are you?

Who was it you called the good shepherd,
Rounding up the kids for their meal
Who chased your shadow running out behind
Clinging to your high flying heels
Your high flying, high flying, high flying heels

Who was it, yeah you know, we real cool
On the far side of the morning, who was it
Yeah you know, we real cool
And I hope you're listening too

Who measured the distance from the planets
Right down to your big blue spinning world
And heartbeats and tears and nervous laughter
Spilling down all over you, girl

Who was it, yeah you know, we real cool
And the world keeps on turning
Who was it, yeah you know, we real cool
And I hope you're listening, are you?

Sirius is 8.6 light years away
Arcturas is 37
The past is the past and it's here to stay
Wikipedia's heaven
When you don't want to remember, you know
On the far side of the morning
Who was it, yea you know, we real cool
And I hope you hear me, and you'll call
Yeah, we real cool
Yeah, we real, real cool
God only knows how far you've come
It must be light years from here
Some distant star you call "the sun"
Does someone miss you back there?

Another world is calling you
Another world is coming through

You look like me, you talk like me
I could believe you're human!
But, late at night, I catch your eye
And I know what you're thinking:

Another world is calling you
Another world is coming through
Calling you to come home

You can't escape from gravity
For you, this earth's a prison
What I would call "human" in me
For you would be "perversion"

Another world is calling you
Whatever happened to the revolution
We all got stoned and it drifted away
Whatever happened to the revolution
I think it died just yesterday

Whatever happened to the revolution
We all got stoned and it drifted away
Whatever happened to the revolution
I think it died just yesterday
I think it died just yesterday

Well I remember back in Nineteen Seventy
The army wanted you and the army wanted me
There was a war goin' on we were out in the streets
Wearin' our badges and stampin' our feet

There's a hundred thousand people all on my side
We didn't care if we lived or died
Hundred thousand people going to make it come
Hundred thousand people had the man on the run

*Whatever happened to the revolution (8 times)

Everybody thought we could win with a vote
So the band went home without playin' a note
We forgot about that war but it still went on
I'm alright Jack see you round so long
I'm alright Jack see you round so long

And now today everyone's a bit older
We're gettin' richer but we're gettin' colder
We're lookin' for somethin' that just ain't there
And it don't mean nothin' to have long hair
So when you're ready to make a stand
Open your mouth and raise your hand
When you're sick of your parties and sick of your sweets
Get off your arses I'll see you out in the streets
Working hard to make a living
bringing shelter from the rain
a father, son left to carry on
blue denim in his vein
oh oh oh he's a working class man

he's running like a psyclone
across the wild mid western sky
oh oh oh he's a working class man

he believes in god and elvis

he did his time in vietnam
still mad at uncle sam
he's a simple man
with a heart of gold
in a complicated land
oh he's a working class man

well he loves a little woman
someday he'll make his wife
saving all the overtime
for the one love of his life
he ain't worried about tomorrow
cause he just made up his mind
life's too short for burning bridges

Sometimes I wish I was a sailor
Way out on the stormy sea,
Far away from the city
and all this misery,
and I wish that I could tell you
just how much you mean to me,
no matter where I run to,
I'll never lose your memory.

Sometimes I close my eyes and drift away,
I can't forget the things I didn't say,
I chose a life that took me away from you,
and I will be forever blue.

When you wake up in tomorrow
and I'm no longer by your side,
just don't think too much about me
and of the many times you've cried,
and wherever you may wander
may good fortune be your guide,
go find another lover,
one who'll never leave your side.

Sometimes I close my eyes and drift away,
I can't forget the things I didn't say,
I chose a life that took me away from you,
and I will be forever blue.

We are living in desperate times
These are desperate times my dear
There's no way out of here
There's no way out my dear
I've been holding back all my tears
Just so the pressure don't show
Like a time bomb ticking away
I might blow up some day

Don't push me, don't shove
You better watch what you do

When my back's to the wall
I might do anything at all
When my back's to the wall
I might take any chance at all
When my back's to the wall
I might do anything

You've got the upper hand
Well i've got nothing to lose
When i'm trapped in a corner like this
I might light a fuse
There's no way out of here
There's no way out my dear

Don't push me, don't shove
You better watch what you do

When my back's to the wall
I might do anything at all
When my back's to the wall
I might take any chance at all
When my back's to the wall
I might do anything, anything

Don't push me too far
You better run for your life

When my back's to the wall
I might do anything at all
When my back's to the wall
I might take any chance at all
When my back's to the wall
I might do anything at all
When my back's to the wall
I might do anything at all

I've got nothing to lose
I might light a fuse
I've got nothing to lose
I might light a fuse
Yeah, yeah......
Look it out
Don't come any closer
Old friend of mine we will never lose the time
That we've shared all these years, these years

Old friend of mine we will never lose the time
That we've shared all these years, these years

Will - you?
Will - you?

Will you make it in the end
Through all the twists and bends?
Will you fulfil your dreams?
Not as easy as it seems

Lover, friend of mine
We will never lose the time
That we've covered in our tears
In our tears

Lover, friend of mine we will never lose the time
That we've covered in our tears, in our tears

Will - you?

Will you make it in the end
Through all the twists and bends?
Will you fulfil your dreams?
Not as easy as it seems

Eeahhi eeahi eah eah eeahhi eeahhi
Eeahhi eeahi eah eah eeahhi eeahhi
Eeahhi eeahi eah eah eeahhi eeahhi

Floating in the weir and you think you'll never sink
So you forget all your fears your fears
Floating in the weir and you think you'll never sink
So you forget all your fears your fears

Will - you?
Will - you?

Will you make it in the end
Through all the twists and bends?
Will you fulfil your dreams?
Not as easy as it seems
Heaven bound in a year of trial
Roll those big gates back easy
Comin' round for the loneliest mile
Hold that glory train for me
The sun sets deep in the valley
Cold river flows into the sea
Sailin' down through that holy hour
Got a message close at hand
Lost and found by the light in the tower
Slow wind on a shiftin' sand
The moon sinks into the ocean
Great waves roll into the bay
Glorybound, take me
I'm glorybound
Lift me up in harmony
Glorybound, take me
I'm glorybound
Hold that car for me
I'm glorybound

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)
Every word they sling you hits like your folks have never been kind
And the jewels on your apron could use some calomine
Ugly girls and pit faced boys all hunch and join in the line
Got the shoe that you lived in
And the towel that you dried in
There's a drink you can drown in
Choose a blanket to die in

Spill a drink on his front and salsa on the plans for a mall and high rise
'Cause there's only so much of string that patron can pull and unwind

Got the shoe that you lived in
And the towel that you dried in
There's a drink you can drown in
Choose a blanket to die in

Check out the towel you can die in

My love of life just gets stronger
As the days go by
Somethings I wish, they would last
Just a little bit longer
As the days go by

Somethings don't look to me
Like they used to be, no

As the days go by, I get a little closer to
As the days go by, a little bit closer to you
As the days go by, I get a little closer
I'm coming back to you

Sure as the wind
Keeps on changing direction
I've come to understand
There's no such a thing as perfection

And what went on before
Doesn't matter anymore

As the days go by, I get a little closer to
As the days go by, a little bit closer to you
As the days go by, I get a little closer
I'm coming back to you
To you, to you

'Cause things don't look to me
Like they used to be

As the days go by, I get a little closer to
As the days go by, a little bit closer to you
As the days go by, I get a little closer to

As the days go by, a little bit closer to you
As the days go by, I get a little closer
I'm coming back to you

Days go by
Look so careful
For a fault
Wait one minute
Say no more
Bewildered then
Bewildered now
Conceal forever
Is this the end?

I'm waiting, I'm changing

Now my eyes are 
Open wide
Fear in voice, 
I remember
Change in mood
I can sense it
Changing every day

I remember 
Infatuation
It's a figure of your 
Imagination
Through young times
Wilder minds
Conceal forever
Is this the end?

Change in mood
I can sense it
Changing every day

Words of meaning
Words of change
You look inside
There's nothing there
I can't, I can't  
No I can't
That's forever

Change in mood
I can sense it
Changing every day
Change in mood
I can sense it
Changing every day

Oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh
La la la la la
La la la la la
Darling,this is goodbye
Kiss me,I don`t know why.
You were always beautiful when you closed your eyes.
Leave now,while we still can.
Let`s not wait until it all gets out of hand.
You`re looking for a criminal,well,I`m a guilty man.

I was the one.

We were wrong from the start
Maybe we tired just a litte too hard.

You don`t have to blame yourself,
you always played your part.
I was the one.

I was.

Darling,look at us now - look at us now
History won`t put us down - won`t put us down
Don`t let anyboby say you could have worked it out.

I was the one.
Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong
Under the shade of a coolibah tree
And he sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled
"You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me."

Down came a jumbuck to drink at the billabong;
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee
And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tuckerbag
"You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me."

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me
And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tuckerbag
"You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me."

Up rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred;
Down came the troopers -- one, two, three
"Where's that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tuckerbag?
You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me."

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me
"Where's that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tuckerbag?
You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me."

Up jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong;
"You'll never catch me alive," said he
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong
"You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me."

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong
"You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me."

Let's kick on back to the places we know (places we know)
The path isn't set yet your life is unsure (your life is unsure)

So your running in circles got a bug in your head
Feel the needles and pins get em out of my head
Take a chance on a rumor
Heard from a friend
That something is gonna change

It's creeping up slowly
She's taking me over
It's turning me on
With every breath that i take
I roll up my dreams
And blow them away

Cruising on blue street my worries are freed
Stressed out and thined out i know exactly what u need

Got ya life wrapped up in the palm of your hand
Try to feel what i feel but u can't understand
No u won't be satisfied till u see
That something is gonna change

Rip it up and turn the page
Slip through the cracks in the stage
And u will find me there
Look past the nose upon your face
It your gonna change

I saw u movin in slowly
Caught a glint in your eye
A moments hesatation
In case ur wondering why
And u won't be satisfied till u see
This meeting of the minds inside of me

Rip it up and turn the page
Look past the nose upon your face
It your gonna change

Rip it up and turn the page
Look past the nose upon your face
It your gonna change

(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)

Hey rainmaker come away
From that man you know
He's gonna take away your promised land
Hey good lady

He just want what you got
You know he'll never stop
Until he's taken the lot

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can make
You forget you're a man

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can make
You forget you're a man

You're a man. He's a man
(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)

Hey rainmaker he got golden plans
I tell you he make you
A stranger in your land
Hey good lady

He got God on his side
He got a double tongue
You never think that he lie

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can make
You forget you're a man

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can make
You forget you're a man,
You're a man, he's a man

Have you heard about the lonesome loser
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Oohoohooh .... oooh ....

Sit down, take a look at yourself
Don't you want to be somebody
Someday somebody's gonna see inside
You have to face up, you can't run and hide

Have you heard about the lonesome loser
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Unlucky in love, least that's what they say
He lost his head and he gambled his heart away
He still keeps searching though there's nothing left
Staked his heart and lost, now he has to pay the cost.

Have you heard about the lonesome loser
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

"It's okay", he smiles and says
Though this loneliness is driving him crazy,
He don't show what goes on in his head,
but if you watch very close you'll see it all

(Instrumental)

Sit down, take a look at yourself
Don't you want to be somebody
Someday somebody's gonna see inside
You have to face up, you can't run and hide

Have you heard about the lonesome loser
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Have you heard about the lonesome loser
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
Now tell me have you heard about the lonesome loser
Oh it's-a lonesome away from your kindred and all
By the campfire at night we'll hear the wild dingoes call
But there's-a nothing so lonesome, morbid or drear
Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer

Now the publican's anxious for the quota to come
And there's a far away look on the face of the bum
The maid's gone all cranky and the cook's acting queer
Oh what a terrible place is a pub with no beer

Then the stockman rides up with his dry dusty throat
He breasts up to the bar and pulls a wad from his coat
But the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer
As the barman says sadly the pub's got no beer

Then the swaggie comes in smothered in dust and flies
He throws down his roll and rubs the sweat from his eyes
But when he is told, he says what's this I hear
I've trudged fifty flamin' miles to a pub with no beer

Now there's a dog on the v'randa, for his master he waits
But the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates
He hurries for cover and he cringes in fear
It's no place for a dog 'round a pub with no beer

And old Billy the blacksmith, the first time in his life
Why he's gone home cold sober to his darling wife
He walks in the kitchen, she says you're early Bill dear
But then he breaks down and tells her the pub's got no beer

Oh it's hard to believe that there's customers still
But the money's still tinkling in the old ancient till
The wine buffs are happy and I know they're sincere
When they say they don't care if the pub's got no beer

So it's-a lonesome away from your kindred and all
By the campfire at night we'll hear the wild dingoes call
But there's-a nothing so lonesome, morbid or drear-a
Wanna tell you 'bout my Frenda
He got hit by a Fender
But he'll soon be on the menda
He's of the male genda

Glad to see that he's on his way
He's not for Buriel today

Because he's in... he's indisposed
Because he's in yeah yeah... he's indisposed

Found him outside the dry cleaners
Oh the drivers misdemeanors
I've never seen a face so greena
He looks a like the cats dinner

Glad to see that he's on his way
He's not for Buriel today

Because he's in... he's indisposed
Because he's in yeah yeah... he's indisposed

He got hit by a car
Now he's lying on the tar
Had an experience bizarre
Not unlike that makes you laugh ra! ra! hey!

Glad to see that he's on his way
He's not for Buriel today

Because he's in... he's indisposed
Because he's in... he's indisposed
Because he's in yeah yeah... he's indisposed
The wisteria on the back veranda is still blooming
And all the great aunts are either insane or dead
Kensington Road runs straight for a while before turning
We lived on the bend it was there I was raised and fed
Counting and running as I go
Down past the hedges all in a row
In Adelaide, Adelaide

Dad's hands used to shake but I never knew he was dying
I was thirteen I never dreamed he could fall
And all the great aunts were red in the eyes from crying
I rang the bells I never felt nothing at all
All the king's horses all the king's men
Cannot bring him back again

Find me a bar or a girl or guitar where do you go on a Saturday night?
I own this town I spilled my wine at the bottom of the statue of Colonel Light
And the streets are so wide everybody's inside
Sitting in the same chairs they were sitting in last year
(This is my town!)
All the king's horses all the king's men
Wouldn't drag me back again
To Adelaide, Adelaide, Adelaide, Adelaide
Don't be confused by my apparent lack of ceremony
My mind is clear
I may be low or miles high off in the distance
I want you near
I love you... even when I'm sleeping
When I close my eyes
You're everywhere
And if they take me flying on the magic carpet
See me wave
If our communication fails I'll reconnect it
I want to rave
I love you... even when I'm sleeping
When I close my eyes
You're everywhere
No matter where the road is leading us remember
Don't be afraid
We have a continent that sometimes comes between us
That's ok
I love you... even when I'm sleeping
When I close my eyes
You're everywhere
When I close my eyes
You're everywhere
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
I kiss the ground on which you walk
I kiss the lips through which you talk
I kiss the city of New York where I first met you
You're my doll and don't forget it
Cause I'm the guy who will regret it
I love you more than when I said it when I first met you
I love the way you talk, you walk, you smile, your style
Like now, Like, wow-wipeout! No doubt
I was gone the moment I laid eyes on you
You'll never be a beauty queen
Won't feature in no magazine
But you're the best that's ever been
I'm glad that I met you
Take every day now as it comes
You take the cake I'll keep the crumbs
I only hear the sound of drums in my heart
(that means that I get you.)
I love the way you walk, you talk, you smile, your style
Your dress, your caress
Well, yes, yes, yes I am impressed
I was gone the moment I laid eyes on you
It's always after midnight
Inside the killin' yard
Hot steam and grime, they're doin' time
I believe they do it hard
They're sinkin' at the gold mine
It's always touch and go
They'll hit the roof, when they see the proof
Out on missionary row
Don't get nervous, pretend you're doin' fine
Don't get nervous, it's not the end of the line
Goin' down heartache road
You really kiss the motherlode
They're swingin' in the death-house
Twistin' in their tombs
Three secret knocks and Satan rocks
Into the powder room
They're makin' big decisions
They won't leave us alone
One last dance, a blind shot chance
Trouble on the phone

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)
We went a walkin out in the sun
We got to talkin havin some fun

Sure feels right
Sure feels good
Get to go a little crazy
It's understood

We went a drivin out in the rain
Old folks arrivin lookin the same

Run to ground
Inch by inch
Pound by pound
And pinch by pinch
Piece by piece
It's all the same
Well two can play
At that game

Hearing the phone ring, waitin to answer
Call up an actress, speak to a dancer

Watching the windsurf watching them capsize
We hear you talking we hear you tell lies
We're getting younger, we're getting older
Taking a jacket, hanging the bowler

Anytime I need to see your face
I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind
And magenta feelings take up shelter
In the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola

I don't even try to explain
I just hold on tight
And if it happens again
I might move so slightly
To the arms
And the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball that
I need to I want to...

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you
When I get to you

Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
(ohh I ohh I)

I'm the kind of person
Who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy getting perfect
Is what I live for
But a look and then
A smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for

Conversation has a time and place
In the interaction
Of a lover and a mate
But the time of talking
Using symbols, using words
Can be likened
To a deep sea diver
Who is swimming with a raincoat

Anytime I need to see your face
I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind
And magenta feelings take up shelter
In the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a cherry cola

I don't even try to explain
I just hold on tight
And if it happens again
I might move so slightly
To the arms
And the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball that
I need to I want to...

Well it's one more boring Thursday night in Adelaide
And it looks like everybody must have died
There's no one on the streets and nothing on TV
Well I think I'll go and burn my TV guide
Doesn't Ernie Sigley bring you down?
Don't you think Mike Willesee's a clown?

Oh well I think I'd like to go and hear some rock'n'roll music played
So I'll check the amusement pages of the paper
Reggae bands doing one night stands at the Lion Hotel and Arkaba
And the girl at the bar thinks I'm going to take her home in my MG and
Hanging out at discos brings you down
Hanging out at discos brings you down

Down on Anzac highway in my rusty old FV
And I'm looking for some food to take away
Finger lickin' kitten and a double fisted bun
Well I've chewed and spewed and so I'm here to say
Orange laminex pizza bars bring you down
Orange laminex pizza bars bring you down

Yes we know it was the festival of art and all that stuff
And the culture vultures still sat on the fence
Before you put your bum on those plush red seats take a look in your backyard
Don't we need some changes in this town?
Arty farty cities bring you down
Don't we need some changes in this town?
Before you put your bum on those plush red seats take a look in your backyard
Don't we need some changes in this town?
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-yeah

It's a long straight road and the engine is deep
I can't help thinkin' of a good night's sleep
And the long long roads of my life were a callin' me

These rough old hands are a-glued to the wheel
My eyes full of sand from the way they feel
And the lights comin' over the hill are a-blindin' me

It's a long tough haul from a-way down south
A man's gotta find a little bread for his mouth
And a home for a girl as sweet as my honey can be

So it's down through the gears, she's a-startin' to pull
The gauge on the tank is a-showin' they're full
And the lights comin' over the hill are a-blindin' me

There's rain on the road and I can feel the load start a-shiftin'
In a dance
Too late, I see the post and I haven't got a ghost of a chance
Ah-hah-hah-no

The windscreen wipers are a-beatin' in time
The song they sing is a part of my mind
And I can't believe it's a-really happenin' to me

Oh, but I'm over the edge and down the mountain side
I know they'll tell about the night I died
In the rain when the lights on the hill were a-blindin' me
Hey!

There's rain on the road and I can feel the load start a-shiftin'
In a dance
Too late, I see the post and I haven't got a ghost of a chance
Ah-hah-hah-no

The windscreen wipers are a-beatin' in time
The song they sing is a part of my mind
And I can't believe it's a-really happenin' to me

Oh, but I'm over the edge and down the mountain side
I know they'll tell about the night I died
In the rain when the lights on the hill were a-blindin' me
In the rain when the lights on the hill were a-blindin' me

Listen now to the wind, babe
Listen now to the rain
Feel that water lickin' at my feet again
I don't wanna see this town no more
Wastin' my days on a factory floor
First thing you know I'll be back in Bow River again

Anytime you want babe, you can come around
But only six days separates me and the great Top End
I been working hard, twelve hours a day
And the money I saved won't buy my youth again
I'm goin' for the heat babe, and the tropical rain
In a place where no man's puttin' on the dog for me
I'm waitin' on the weekend, set o' brand new tyres
And back in Bow River's just where I want to be

Listen now to the wind, babe
Listen now to the rain
Feel that water lickin' at my feet again
I don't wanna see this town no more
Too many years made up my mind to go or stay
Right to my dying day
I don't wanna see another engine line
Too many years and I owe my mind
First set o' wheels headin' back Bow River again
First thing you know I'll be back in Bow River again

I got the motor runnin', I got the rest of my days
Sold everything I owned for just a song
So anytime you want babe, you can come around
But don't leave it too late, you just might find me gone

Listen now to the wind, babe
Listen now to the rain
Feel that water lickin' at my feet again
I don't wanna see this town no more
Too many years made up my mind to go or stay
Right to my dying day
I don't wanna see another engine line
Too many years and I owe my mind
First set o' wheels headin' back Bow River again

I don't need the score
I'm goin' through the door
Gonna tell the man I don't want no more
Pick up a fast car and burn my name in the road
One week, two week, maybe even more
Piss all my money up against the damn wall
First thing you know I'll be back in Bow River again
First thing you know I'll be back in Bow River again

First thing you know I'll be
Back in Bow River
Again
You can't make mother cry
You can't make her twist her ragged hair
You can't make mother groan
Even when her soldier sonny
Shakes his iron cocktail in the air...
You can't make mother cry
You can't make her give consent
Though she flounders at the drainboard
Though her back be down there and bent
If sleeping brings relief
She can go lie down and slumber
If sleeping brings relief
She can go lie down and slumber
If sleeping brings relief
She can go... lie down and slumber...
Slumber
She puts her hands down into the sink
Scrapes the grunge up off the bottom
Down there beneath the dishes
Where the knives lie crossed and waiting
She can't stop the kiddies talking
Their tongues be loosed upon the world
They flap until they lather
For the agony of millions
And if sleeping brings relief
They can go lie down and slumber
And if sleeping brings relief
They can go lie down and slumber
And if sleeping brings relief
They can... go lie down and slumber
Slumber...
And there be no release from anguish
For this slapstick generation
And there be no peace for all the kiddies
'Cause they're too satisfied to care
And the field of gorgeous bodies
Primed and ready in the sun
And the white flag of peace
That is hanging
Limp and useless in the air...
And the white flag of peace
That is hanging
Limp and useless in the air, yeah!
And if sleeping brings relief
You can all go lie down and slumber
And if sleeping brings relief
You can go lie down and slumber...
Slumber...
Well old Bob hasn't got much but he values his boots
He values the time he spends growin' flowers
He still loves his babies that grew to be men
He recalls all the days 'n' nights and the hours
When he and his woman worked on the land
In the heat and the dry, in the cold and the wet
He still picks her a rose and his old heart still races
She's still the most beautiful girl that he's met
And you ask is he happy...and you ask is he happy...?
He's got wrinkles from smiling, he feels lucky and free
And he knows what it means to live here in the sunshine
He's got wrinkles......

He walks with Amelia down to the store
With a little cane basket for the bread and the daily Sun
Still hand in hand like babes in the meadows
And young faces turn
Love is so beautiful, it can be so deep
And a man is a king when he has his own princess
Bob wears no crown, no long flowing robe
But there in his mind he still rides on his black stallion

Then a cold winter came, and Bob was alone
His beautiful princess had flown with the angels
He faded so quickly, the man became old
And the wandering dew soon covered the roses
First just a cane, then a strong stick for walking
Then just a chair with a grey old man dying
All that he lived for was always beside him
So Bob left in peace, to join his lady

And you ask is he happy...and you ask is he happy...?
He had wrinkles from smiling
He felt lucky and free
And he knew what it meant to live here in the sunshine
He had wrinkles......

From the day that we were born we've been heading down a track
Sometimes it's made for good sometimes for bad
But if we look behind us there's a wave coming down
Carrying us forward to a new age

What about the world around us
How can we fail to see
And now that our fathers have gone
And we've been left to carry on
What about the age of reason

So why can't we be still why can't we love each other
Is kindness an ancient skill buried by our blindness
And if we look behind us there's a wind blowing in
To create the age of reason

If we consider carefully the options put before us
So much wisdom so much love so much waiting for us
And if we look ahead there's the sun and the seasons
Another day another age of reason

Love is everywhere, I don't want to bend down and pick it up
Love is everywhere, a shocking week but can Sunday bail me out
Love is everywhere, I want to sit here and hear the sound of that thing

What can an elfin do, put on a kettle for you?
Leave your mother in the cupboard, the writing's on the wall
I'm not coming back here no anymore

Take it all from me, I don't want it
Love is everywhere, I don't want to bend down and pick it up
Love is everywhere, I might just sit here and look around

Watching the day go by, putting all your eggs in the sky
Catch a bus and read a poem, look around there's no-one home
I think that I might stay here for quite a while

Love is everywhere, my mum's got a new boyfriend and I like the man
Take it all from me, je ne veux pas coucher avec toi ce soir
Love is everywhere, I want to sit here and hear the sound of that thing

Ice in your eye
Assuming that you never come
And that we never feel the same way
You slave, sleep tight
Home at last in my own cocoon
Not yours in my own
Mind of doubts

Here's how, she's now
How is it when you are you
And you can't see the way you failed me

Am I wasting, all my time
Am I wasting, all my time
Am I wasting, all my time
Am I wasting

I have, you have
Assuming that this
Tragedy is actually unassumable

Am I wasting, all my time
Am I wasting, all my time
Am I wasting, all my time
Am I wasting

Doubts failed

Shutters are drawn and I'm fully loved
Too much fruit and I give up

Wasting

Bop Girl
B-O-P-G-I-R-L
Got the whole world searching for their own bop girl
Out in the crowd, I'm in the street
Got the whole world shaking to my big bop beat
She's a bop girl
She's a bop, she's a bop bop girl
All you follow, I'll lead the way
Oh, the bop girl's A-OK
Dig the bop girl, start to move
Down inside that microgroove

B-O-P-G-I-R-L
Got the whole world searching for their own bop girl
Out in the crowd, I'm in the street
Got the whole world shaking to my big bop beat
She's a bop girl
She's a bop, she's a bop bop girl
At the dance I'm with my man
Dig the flow, jump with the band
I got friction, I can't stop
I'm a dancing spinning top

B-O-P-G-I-R-L
Got the whole world searching for their own bop girl
Out in the crowd, I'm in the street
Got the whole world shaking to my big bop beat
Now dig the bop girl
A-and swing that thing, owooooooo!

We argued on the channel train to Paris
The vin rouge helped us make it sweet again
But by the time that we got down to Lyon
Everything I said was wrong and you cursed me in the rain
We split up for a while in Barcelona
We met up six days later in Madrid
I was hoping that the break would make things go a little better for us
And for a little while it almost did
Now I'm in a bar in Copenhagen
And i'm trying hard to forget your name
And I'm staring at the label on a bottle of cerveza
And every fucking city feels the same

You said to call you when I got to London
A French girl told me that you'd left a note
I said to her "I like your accent" and she thought I sounded funny
So we ended up drinking in Soho
Foolishly I followed you to Dublin
Like a ghost I walked the streets of Temple Bar
And all the bright young things were throwing up their Guinness in the gutters
And once I thought I saw you from afar
Now I'm in a nightclub in Helsinki
And they're playing La Vida Loca once again
And I can't believe I'm dancing to this crap but I'm a chance here
And every fucking city sounds the same

At a cafe in the port of Amsterdam
An E-mail from you said you'd gone to Rome
For a minute I thought maybe but my funds were running low
And anyway it sounded like you weren't alone
So I headed north until I got to Hamburg
A chilly city suits a troubled soul
And on the Reeperbahn I paid a woman far too much
To kick me out before I'd even reached my goal
Now I'm in a restaurant in Stockholm
And the waiter here wants me to know his name
And I can order sandwiches in seven different languages
But every fucking city looks the same
Arrivederci, au revoir, auf Wiedersehen, hasta la vista baby
Yeah, every fucking city's just the same
See those Guccis and silver Commodores
See those Guccis and silver Commodores
Sold my soul to the CES, they sent my cheque to the wrong address

A fruit bouquet like month-old socks
Gerrymander winner at the ballot box

Chaos in the kitchen, it's a crying shame

Running blind, drunk on Yarralumla wine

All the boys and girls are taking out Bankcards
And contemplating Space Invaders in pizza bars
My television screen's an alcoholic haze
The Sullivans and reruns of Happy Days

Murdoch and Packer, thanks for the news
Read three pages and you feel half-boozed
Force-fed years with a loving cup

I've checked all the dailies
And subscription mail ins
But where do we come from?
You never stopped dusting
My middle ear's always buzzing
Where do we belong?
Trust me not 'cause I still don't know

We're not in someone else's
Someone else's home

Do you really want to exist
Past 1946
Or have I got you wrong?

When nothing much matters
But shoes, pants and haircuts
The morning engines go

Heaven's toast, like the sound they told

We're not in someone else's
Someone else's home
We're gonna run away, make your heart my own
And if we're not hot at least we're not
In someone else's home

Subscription filled the yellow pills

We're not in someone else's
Someone else's home
We're gonna run away, make your heart my own
And if we're not hot at least we're not
In someone else's home
Estimated time of arrival 9.30 a.m
Been up before the sun and now I'm tired before I even begin
(Now you're flying) I got so much work in front of me
(Really flying) it stretches out far as the eye can see
I can see

Spend half my life in airports doing crosswords and attempting to sleep
And when the bar is open then you'll often find me warming a seat
(Now you're flying) I never find a place where I can stay
(Really flying) I'd rather be a thousand miles away

Thousand miles away
Working for yourself sometimes ain't all that it's cracked up to be
It can be as lonely at the top as at the bottom of that corporate tree
(Now you're flying) I'm told I'm going places - who can say ?
(Really flying) I might arrive but I'll be gone the very next day
I must be on my way
A thousand miles away

Promised to myself someday I'd take the time and try to make sense
Out of all those opportunities I've lost from trying to sit on the fence
(Now you're flying) But right now I've got no time for yesterday
(Really flying) Yesterday's a thousand miles away
A thousand miles away
What was that that you were trying to say ?
I guess I was a thousand miles away
Sing it again
General is a wise man
The General is a gun
Shake up this scribbly world
And run run run
He's laughing like a doctor
But I bit his crazy mouth
Believe this faithful daughter
As he squeezed into her house
And run run run
Gently as you squeeze us
Your jelly beans will be shocked
Squeeze this juice that's in us
And squeeze me till I drop
General is a wise man
The General is the shock
Flip Flop Ego
We go now Flip Flop
General is a wise man
General is a gun
General is this partner as we run run run
Shocked as you prickle me as you got to know too well
Too gentle you were wise man and I broke your holy bell
And run run run

Late on a Friday, my husband went up
To the mountains with three friends
They took provisions and bottles of bourbon
To last them all through the weekend
One hundred miles they drove
Just to fish in a stream
And there's so much water, so close to home

When they arrived, it was cold and dark
They set up their camp quickly
Warmed up with whiskey, they walked to the river
Where the water flowed past darkly
In the moonlight they saw the body
Of a girl floating face down
And there's so much water, so close to home

When he holds me now, I'm pretending
I feel like I'm frozen inside
And behind my eyes, my daily disguise
Everything's turning to white

It was too hard to tell how long she'd been dead
The river was that close to freezing
But one thing for sure
The girl hadn't died very well to judge from the bruising
They stood there above her all thinking
The same thoughts at the same time
There's so much water, so close to home

So this is what they did:
They carried her downstream from their fishing
Between two smooth rocks they gently wedged her
After all, it was late, and they'd come a long way
The girl would keep; she was going nowhere
They stayed up there fishing for two days
They reported it on Sunday when they came back down
There's so much water, so close to home

When he holds me now, I'm pretending
Nothing is working inside
And behind my eyes, my daily disguise
Everything's turning to white

The newspapers said that the girl had been strangled
To death and also molested
On the day of the funeral the radio reported
That a young man had been arrested
I went to the service a stranger
I drove past the lake out of town
There's so much water, so close to home

When he holds me now I'm pretending
I feel like I'm frozen inside
And behind my eyes, my daily disguise
Everything's turning to white

I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

Well I know lots of the in-crowd, I like to think I'm one
I spend all my winters in St Moritz, just a lazin' in the sun
So I bought Miss '78 Playmate a brand new M.G.B
But some guy who could dance and kept a gun his pants
Stole her away from me - and mumma tell me why

Some people have all the fun
Some people have all the fun
Some guys dance and some girls are you-un
Some people have all the fun

I wear carefully faded designer jeans and I once met Marlon Brando
And I even bought a drink for the Aga Khan but he would not shake my hand
Oh mumma make me happy, send me lots more cash
Don't worry, I saw the Midnight Express thirty-six times
And I know where to keep my stash - and mumma tell me why

Some people have all the fun
Some people have all the fun
Some guys dance and some girls run
Some people have all the fun - oh mumma

Oh mumma - tell me why-why-why
I spent sixteen grand on an M.G.B
What else could she want from me-ee
Oh, oh, oh mumma tell me why

Some people have all the fun
Some people have all the fun
Some guys dance and some girls are you-un
Some people have all the fun

So I borrowed Uncle Rocky's yacht to take her sailin' out on the sea
She said you know me, honey, I'd love to come
But can I bring my boyfriend with me, so there we all were in Bermuda
Soakin' up our Hollywood tans
But they kicked over my castle and they sprayed me with sand
I said mumma, I don't understand why
Some people go partyin', some people got mortal sin
But Miss '78 and her neanderthal mate, well they just won't let me join in
Mumma tell me why-why

Some people have all the fun
It's enough to make you cry-why
Some people h

Green fields 
Grass and earth 
Broken bottles 
Bricks and dirt 
Sunshine soothing 
Clouds are hazy 
Dark street corners 
Feeling lazy 
Fast car driving 
Sleek and modern 
Public transit 
Photos waiting 
Blood and glass 
Three points of rain 
Carpet lining 
Seats reclining 

Clever words on smooth tongue talking 
Shove it brother 
Just keep walking 

City penthouse 
The kitchen living 
A country home 
It's a kitchen living 
Money can buy almost anything 
But anything's nothing when you're dead
That's the two we are you and me
I can't make you talk, I'll make you see
Us and them just can't agree
We can't write the songs we want
To make it up to eachother
So we'll just take it out on our brothers
I'll see you 'round the world
See you 'round the world

Make your mother proud, yeah
Never a blemish on your face
Skinniest guy I could never replace
We'll drag another round, yeah
And create another problem
And spill it out on our favourite album

Is it be cool if I grab a little of your time?
I feel my heart over crowded
Steal everything you say and make it mine
If my head would allow it
Never trust anybody with a clear face
Shouldn't have to shout it
Your the enemy I know I'd never replace

See you 'round the world
I can feel it floating away
Inch by inch
Day by day
Love boat set itself free
Castaway, slipping out to sea

I can feel it coming adrift
Even a blind man could see the rift
From an ocean liner
To a Chinese junk
There ain't been a ship that can't be sunk

I used to dream it could last forever
But pipe dreams never come true
I'd be foolin' myself if I never
Thought something like this
Couldn't happen to you

I said baby
You've got a man on your mind
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
Goodbye

You don't know
Just what you got
Till it's gone
I guess you heard that a lot
But it's true
It's not just a game
You can't change your life
By changing your name

It's not something you can hide away
Sooner or later it starts to show
It's written on your face
You've been betrayed
Do you really believe that I don't know

I said baby
You've got a man on your mind
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
(Goodbye)

He's already fallen
So it's no use to fight
And if he starts callin'
Let him know you're with me
For the rest of the night

Ooh, I said baby
You've got a man on your mind
(Got a man on your mind)
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
Goodbye

Baby
(Please listen to me baby)
You've got a man on your mind
(Gotta get that man off your mind)
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
Goodbye

Baby
(Ooh, baby baby baby)
You've got a man on your mind
(You got that man on your mind)
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
Goodbye
I know, I know
She's gonna go this morning
No sun will shine today
And this body's feeling strained and dispossessed
Full of fear and trembling for her
Her last words to go away
Yeeeaah

But blind faith's trying to tell me it isn't over
Tell me it do not have to be
And storm water's weeping on my bedroom window
Blow me up and throw me up and

Please, come on and please me
Tease, come on and tease me
Please, come on and please me
Come on and tease me

If you say you want me
I won't say no
Because nothing's gonna pacify, satisfy
That rattlin' window

If you say you want me
I won't say no
Because nothing's gonna pacify, satisfy
That rattlin' window

I know, I know
She's gonna go this morning
No sun will shine today
And this body's feeling strained and dispossessed
Full of fear and trembling for her
Her last words to go away

But blind faith's
Trying to tell me it isn't over
Tell me it do not have to be
Storm water's weeping on my bedroom window
Throw me up and blow me up and

Please, come on and please me
Tease, come on and tease me
You gotta tease me

If you say you want me, I won't say no
Because nothing's gunna pacify, satisfy, pacify, satisfy, pacify, satisfy
That rattling window
Welcome to the strangest party, baby
It's like we're staring at the sun
Everybody's got their invitations
Hopin' that you're gonna come, yeah

These are the times (times)
These are the crimes (crimes)
What are we waiting for
What are we hating for

You're part of the solution or part of the problem
You're gonna have to dance with one
You're giving up on the future, honey
I'll count you out of having some, yeah! So

These are the times (times)
These are the crimes (crimes)
What are we waiting for
What are we hating for
Here comes the rain
Yeah! Here comes the rain now

You messed about

It was a party night
It was the end of school
His head was feeling light -- first time
She seemed much older then
She had turned 17
And she knew some older men -- first time

Come said the boy
Let's go down to the sand
Let's do what we wanna do -- let me be a man for you

Ho, oh, oh, oh
Ho, oh, oh, oh
Ho, oh, oh, oh
Ho, oh, oh, oh

And she said -- well i've been waiting for a long time, and you've changed a lot
Up-till now it's been the wrong time to know whether to from here or not -- ohhh well come with me boy, just take my hand
I'll let you see what you wanna see -- come on be a man for me

Ho, ho, ho

We've both been waiting for a long time
We've both changed a lot
Up-till now it seemed the wrong time -- to know wether to from here or not
Ohhhhhh...

But come said the boy, let's go down on the sand, let's do what we wanna do -- let me be a man for you
She said come with me boy
Just take my hand
I'll let you see what you wanna see -- come on be my man for me

[Background Chorus vocals]
Ho, oh, oh, oh
Ho, oh, oh, oh
Ho, oh, oh, oh
Ho, oh, oh, oh

It was a party night, it was the end of school
His head was feeling light -- it was the first time
She seemed much older then, she had turned 17 -- and she knew some older men...
For the first time
I know they all want you
With your Desdemona's eyes
I'll keep you from danger
Save you from prying eyes

I can make the world safe for you
Come and live over here
I can make the world safe for you
Come and live over here
I can make the world safe for you
Nothing bad'll happen now

I've got a problem
I think you know how I feel
Plans piling up in the corner
Eyeballing me every hour

Got a balcony
And an orange tree
You can save up and visit New York with me
I can make the world safe for you
Nothing bad at all

You've got no money
So I know how you feel
When you see the glitter
Turn around it's no big deal

I can make the world safe for you
Come and live over here
I can make the world safe for you
Come and live over here
I can make the world safe for you
Nothing bad'll happen now

I brought back a souvenir
All the way from Kampuchea
A plastic bag up my ass
And soon the goods will all come to pass

I sell the seeds of misery
I got a deal and a place to be

Make that call, get on the phone
Chase the dragon

You got the kind of hunger
That makes you sick
You got an ugly itch
That sweat on your neck

You need it now
You need a blast
Make that call
Do it fast

I sell the seeds of misery
I got a deal and a place to be

Make that call, get on the phone
Chase the dragon
Come on, get on the phone
Chase the dragon

I brought back a souvenir
All the way from Kampuchea
A plastic bag up my ass
And soon the goods will all come to pass

I sell the seeds of misery
I got a deal and a place to be

Make that call, get on the phone
Chase the dragon
Come on, get on the phone
Chase the dragon
We've seen her type before
Sandals and the hair
They fall in love with big dumb boys
And we sit and stare

So, we walk the long way home
Glasses in our hands
When the last of the ice is eaten
Throw them as far as we can

There's a problem, there's no sleepy girl
To wrap you in her loving arms
There's a lizard on the doorstep
But there is music in my head

We put the world on hold
Two young men growing old
We talk of years like lost weekends
And the harbor shrugs

Because friends are getting fewer
And we vow life will be fuller
But if the last of our dreams is broken
We'll walk the same way home

There's a problem, there's no sleepy girl
To wrap you in her loving arms
There's no sleepy girl
To wrap you in her loving arms
There's a lizard on the doorstep
And there is music in my head

There's a gold star on your forehead
But there is trouble up ahead
Charlie, what'll become of us?
I had my dreams for both of us, for both of us

You might be unworthy
But you remember what I remember
And that's enough to care
You don't fall off the rails
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
Now I'm so blue

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
What should I do

Sitting here looking at your picture
At a smile time can't erase
And like reflections in a mirror, I see you
Holdin' hands with a guy of a different face, yeah

Oh, since you've been gone I've been trembling
Of the need to hold you close
But I've been caught in a syndrome of pride
Oh, baby, from love you just can't hide, no

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
Now I'm so blue

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
What should I do

Sitting reminiscing, lost in thoughts of yesterday
Don't wanna face reality because you're not here with me
Lost in the past, don't think I'll last
Without your love, without your love, yeah

Oh, since you've been gone, I've been trembling
Of the need to hold you close
But I've been caught in the syndrome of pride
Oh, baby, from love you just can't hide, no

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
What should I do

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
Now I'm so blue

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
What should I do
Hey, did you ever wake up in the morning
On the wrong side of the bed
A bit confused and yawning
You go straight out the back to your shed

Yeah, all Australian boys need a shed
A place where he can go, somewhere to clear his head
To think about the things his woman said
Yeah, all Australian boys need a shed

A joint to learn to read an' write, to work on his bike at night
To grow up as he likes, to grow anything under lights
A place to keep his tools, nuts and bolts and drills
To hang a hide, to hide the dry or hang to pay the bills

Well my old shed, she leaks a bit, the roof is caving in
Nothing that a bloke can't fix with a few spare sheets of tin
The beams are old telegraph poles, white ants have eaten out
She creaks and sways on windy days and leans towards the south

(optional verse)
And there's a fridge in the corner with a few cans on the ice
And a calendar from the tire service hangs above the vice
All the pictures so far are easy on the eye
But I've had a sneaky preview and I can't wait for July

Yeah, all Australian boys need a shed

At the back of the shed where the dogs are fed near last years bails of Lucerne
Sticky tall green leaves came up from thrown out seeds
All it took was bantam poop, I watered 'em once and they grew some
They should be prime 'bout Easter time if no nosy neighbor steals 'em

Yeah, all Australian boys need a shed
To weld up broken gates, a place for all his mates
To come 'round Sunday arvo' for a jam
A place to make a racket, to find the pipe and pack it
To think about the things his woman said
Yeah, all Australian boys need a shed
Yeah, all Australian boys need a shed
Yeah, all Australian boys need a shed

Always were out of time, the action makes you smile
When your hands are by your sides
Feed the tree that you love
A light comes from above
Then it fades before your eyes
Do you see it? Do you feel it?
Well I mean it

Well you're right outside of me
Didn't seem to care
And you had your hold on me
You know it's not fair

Make it last for the while, keep it with your eyes
Yeah it's you they're thinking of
Lasts for more than a while
Turns into a style
When you feed the tree you love
Can you feel it? Do you see it?
Well I mean it

You wake up, you take up, you pace round, you're spaced out
You're taken up with what you see
You wake up, you take up, you pace round, you're spaced out
You're taken up with what you see
One more time - what you see (x3), you say it's not fair

It's not fair
Don't you wish that your kids all looked more fine?
Do you feel that your guy's below your style?
Animal slippers and a drink over Sunday mail
Coffee teeth and a cigarette heart for sale
Any minute now something's gonna happen
Everything's falling 'cept the shit you fell in

Mailman, black umbrella
Doesn't feel the need to tell ya
Sure have looked better
And ego kissing fools
Are teaching your kids in private schools
Crack another bottle, it's five

Monday morning who could ask for more
Smoking buds, got your friends all 'round next door

Any minute now something's gonna happen
Everything's falling 'cept the shit you fell in

Mailman, black umbrella
Doesn't feel the need to tell ya
Kudzu Cinderella
Them ego kissing fools
Are teaching your kids in private schools
Crack another bottle, it's five

All you got it this moment
Twenty-first centurys yesterday
You can care all you want
Everybody does, yeah, that's ok

[Pre-Chorus]
So slide over here
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
Youre one of my kind

I need you tonight
Cause I'm not sleeping
Theres something about you girl
That makes me sweat
How do you feel?
I'm lonely
What do you think?
Can't think at all
Whatcha gonna do?
Gonna live my life

[Pre-Chorus]
So slide over here
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
Youre one of my kind

I need you tonight
Cause I'm not sleeping
Theres something about you girl
That makes me sweat
How do you feel?
I'm lonely
What do you think?
Can't think at all
Whatcha gonna do?
Gonna live my life
How do you feel?

I'm lonely..

What do you think?
Can't think at all
Whatcha gonna do?
Gonna live my life
So slide over here
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know

[Outro]
So slide over here
And give me a moment
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
Youre one of my kind
Like a snake calling on the phone
I've got no time to be alone
There is someone coming at me all the time
Yeah babe I think I'll lose my mind

'Cause I'm stranded on my own
Stranded far from home, all right

I'm riding on a midnight train
And everybody looks just the same
A subway light it's dirty reflection
I'm lost babe I got no direction

And I'm stranded on my own
Stranded far from home, all right

Stranded - yeah I'm on my own
Stranded - I'm so far from home
Stranded - you gotta leave me alone
'Cause I'm stranded on my own, stranded far from home

Come on!

Look at me looking at you
There ain't a thing that I can do
You are lost, your mind is stuck in a whirl
Yeah honey such a stupid girl

Now I'm stranded on my own
Stranded far from home, come on

Stranded - yeah I'm on my own
Stranded - I'm so far from home
Stranded - you gotta leave me alone
'Cause I'm stranded on my own, stranded far from home

All right

Livin' in a world insane
They cut out some heart and some brain
Been filling it up with dirt
Yeah baby dunno how it hurts

To be stranded on your own
Stranded far from home, all right

Stranded - I'm so far from home
Stranded - yeah I'm on my own
Stranded - you got to leave me alone

Come on!

Stranded - I'm so far from home
Stranded - yeah I'm on my own
Stranded - you got to leave me alone
'Cause I'm stranded on my own
Stranded
I said, hey, do you remember
Where we used to sit?
All them summer rubber-necks kept coming
To panel-van street
We just yacht club dancing, city girls were rich
I'm going to sneak out my window at four in the morning
Going to meet them on the beach

Lakeside, lakeside, lakeside
Steal away, hide away
Lakeside, lakeside, lakeside
I just can't wait, I just can't wait

I got a terrific Torana
A green hand going to wave bye-bye
I got a C.B. shuffle and a dashboard muffle
Pilot's twitch my eye
I've seen them from the mallway, supermarket spy
From the frozen goods section, the delicatessen
I've seen them racing by

They're going to wallow in the shallows
Great puce hippo
Bar-b-que and blubber
Please don't show, please don't show
They're going to steal my sand space
Out where the comperes go
You shoulda seen 'em bathers!
No hero, no hero
I said, hey, do you remember
Going cruising for a nude?
Spot-pickin'em, sand kicken'em
All the lousy and the lewd
Hello there sailor
Hi there Lili Marlene
Good morning school girls
Welcome to the team

Beehive hairdo forty-five on the hip
Patrolwoman Saunders don't you give her no lip
Took me to the station for a breath test
Then back to her bedroom for some house arrest

Women in uniform sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform but oooh they feel so warm

Flying to my hometown on a 747
Stewardess made me feel like I'm in heaven
Looking up the aisle trying to see what I could see
She leaned over and said coffee tea or me
White apron and brown leather shoes
The nurse at the clinic left my heart all bruised
Broke my left leg and sprained my right
Now she takes my temperature every night

Women in uniform sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform but ooh they feel so warm
Women in uniform Women in uniform
Women in uniform Women in uniform

Commando raid on the Lebanese border
Sergeant Anita she gives the order
Khaki jacket and a sten gun
Baby I surrender let's have some fun

Women in uniform sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform but ooh they feel so warm
Women in uniform Women in uniform
Women in uniform Women in uniform

Khaki navy blue and brass buttons bring me to my knees
A peaked cap and a badge or two oooh they're such a tease
So girls if the man you need just won't come across
Put on a uniform show him who's the boss

Women in uniform sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform but ooh they feel so warm
Women in uniform khaki white and blue
Women in uniform coming after you

Women in uniform sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform but ooh they feel so warm

Women in uniform
Women in uniform
Women in uniform
Women in uniform

Women in uniform khaki white and blue
Women in uniform coming after you

Women in uniform
Women in uniform
Women in uniform
Women in uniform
Women in uniform
Women in uniform
Women in uniform
Women in uniform
Women in uniform
Could never walk away from that girl
She's the only one in the world
She's the ruler of the table-top
She's no persnickety, she's real persimmon
She's all I got
She's a pretty serene surrender
Unlike Chrissie she's no pretender
She's my coupe dynaflow
She's no disguise and it's no surprise
She's all I know

I said love gets really tough
That's when love beats me up

I don't own my own record player
I use hers its just the same
We're getting so much more au fait(er)
She's soya chookin' and I'm just lookin'
At summer again

I said love gets really tough
That's when love beats me up

She wants to move my monty picture
I've got a thing about where it goes
I think she wishes I was richer
Well it ain't too bad, I'm fair to middling
Oh, so-so...

I said love gets really tough
That's when love beats me up
There's a guy singing in the edge of the room
Making sounds through a face like a prune
He's got them fancy checkered pants and a chip in his tooth
Oh no, yeah, yeah, yeah
Suffocating from patchouli and smoke
Here's the fifty-first song that he wrote
About the girl who split fifty weeks ago
Oh no, yeah, yeah, yeah

And there's a weight sitting real heavy down there on his shoulder
The patented moves growing colder
The seventh chord just keeps getting older

Oh my soul, just hit me if I get on a roll
But this all sounded so good in the bedroom cold
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

But its only a 2 AM tune
With a bridge lifted from "My Aim Is True"
From the setlist drink to the practice room
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

But there's a weight sitting real heavy down there on his shoulder
The patented moves growing colder
The seventh chord just keeps getting older

And he knows just as sure as this microphone stinks
There's a change coming through and he ain't going home alone tonight

And there's a weight sitting real heavy down there on his shoulder
The seventh chord just keeps getting older
Is it me or is the room getting colder

Oh, we're going down, but don't it sound sweet
Feel the dust building up at our feet
The seventh chord just keeps getting older
If there's one thing in my life that's missing
It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water

There's lots of those friendly people
They're showing me ways to go
But I never want to lose their inspiration

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
And now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change

Well, I was born in the sign of water
And it's there that I feel my best
The albatross and the whales, they are my brothers

It's kind of a special feeling
When you're out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon like a lover

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change

I've never been romantic
And sometimes I don't care
I know it may sound selfish
But let me breathe the air
Yeah, yeah
Let me breathe the air

If there's one thing in my life that's missing
It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water

It's kind of a special feeling
Out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon like a lover

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool, cool, cool change

(Time for a cool change)
It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time
For a cool, cool change
(Time for a cool change)
Ooh, I know it's time for a cool, cool change
(Time for a cool change)
Now that my life is so prearranged
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
(Time for a cool change)
It's time for a cool change
Yes it is, yes it is, yes it is
You know it's time for a cool change
It might've been the angels
Fallin' in the street
It could've been the stars crashin'
Every time we'd meet
It might've been a ghost train
Wailin' out of sight
But it had to be you
In the heart of the night

If someone takes a dagger
Holds it to your throat
Might be time to get ready
Time to grab your coat
There's nothing in the harbour
Just the dead city light
You're lost on a corner
In the heart of the night

Take the flame
Hold it up lighter
Light my soul
Set it on fire

You might get a warning
Or maybe just a sign
Don't be in a hurry
To find out why
Because there's nothing in the harbour
Just the dead city light
You're running away from me
In the heart of the night

(J. Camilleri N. Smith – Rondor Warner Chappell)
You are my sword
Your love is its own reward
My heart, I have found
Gets carved surely by the pound

God knows I tried
Tried to hold you with all my might
But time has won
And I could never be that strong

(Don't cry) I couldn't be that strong
(Don't cry) that used to be my favourite song
(Don't cry) tears so bittersweet
(Don't cry) fill my eyes whenever we meet
It's always bittersweet

I cut and I bleed
You seem to find that so hard to believe
Well, that's just too, too bad
You could never touch the love that we had

(Don't cry) for the love we had
(Don't cry) some time we'll try to take it back
(Don't cry) tears so bittersweet
(Don't cry) they kiss my cheeks whenever we meet
It's always bittersweet

(Don't cry) for a love gone wrong
(Don't cry) that used to be my favourite song
(Don't cry) tears so bittersweet
(Don't cry) fill my eyes whenever we meet
Anyway

We've grown and times change
When we meet now it feels so strange
Well, I hold you like a sword
And you won't cut me, cut me like you did before

It's always bittersweet
It's always bittersweet
It's always bittersweet
Bittersweet, bittersweet
All the towers of ivory are crumbling
And the swallows have sharpened their beaks
This is the time of our great undoing
This is the time that I'll come running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
One more time

The light in our window is fading
The candle gutters on the ledge
Well now sorrow, it comes a-stealing
And I'll cry, girl, but I'll come a-running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
Once again

Gone are the days of rainbows
Gone are the nights of swinging from the stars
For the sea will swallow up the mountains
And the sky will throw thunder-bolts and sparks
Straight at you
But I'll come a-running
Straight to you
But I'll come a-running
One more time

Heaven has denied us its kingdom
The saints are drunk howling at the moon
The chariots of angels are colliding
Well, I'll run, babe, but I'll come running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
One more time
Conquistador of Mexico
The Zulu and the Navaho
The Belgians in the Congo
Plantation in Virginia
The Raj in British India
The deadline in South Africa

The story of El Salvador
The silence of Hiroshima
Destruction of Cambodia

Short memory, must have a short memory

The sight of hotels by the Nile
The designated Hilton style
With running water specially bought

A smallish man Afghanistan
A watch dog in a nervous land
They're only there to lend a hand
The friendly five a dusty smile
Wake up in a sweat at dead of night
And in the tents new rifles, hey, short memory

Short memory, must have a short memory

Wouldn't you know it I've lost my courage
Isn't that funny me lost for words
Not that it really matters 'cause I know you know
And you would have told me yourself if you could

Remember the first time we met each other
You were in your world and I was in mine
Breaking down the barriers we broke all the rules
But wasn't it good wasn't it fine

While I took for granted, you took your time
Longing for love oh how we tried
It's over now that's understood, but wasn't it good

So long together, two would be lovers
Caring for flowers that just wouldn't grow
And in all of our tomorrows, we'll have yesterday
And wasn't it good, wasn't it fine

While I took for granted, you took your time
Longing for love, oh how we tried
It's over now that's understood

But wasn't it good
I don't believe in an interventionist God
But I know, darling, that you do
But if I did I would kneel down and ask Him
Not to intervene when it came to you
Not to touch a hair on your head
To leave you as you are
And if He felt He had to direct you
Then direct you into my arms

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms

And I don't believe in the existence of angels
But looking at you I wonder if that's true
But if I did I would summon them together
And ask them to watch over you
To each burn a candle for you
To make bright and clear your path
And to walk, like Christ, in grace and love
And guide you into my arms

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms

But I believe in Love
And I know that you do too
And I believe in some kind of path
That we can walk down, me and you
So keep your candles burning
And make her journey bright and pure
That she will keep returning
Always and evermore

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms
Well he lived on the best side of opportunity street

O DEANNA
O Deanna!
O DEANNA
Sweet Deanna!
O DEANNA
You know you are my friend, yeah
O DEANNA
And I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love or money
I'm down here for your soul

No carpet on the floor
And the winding cloth holds many moths
Around your Ku Klux furniture
I cum of death-head in your frock
We discuss the murder plan
We discuss murder and the murder act
Murder takes the wheel of your Cadillac
And death climbs in the back

O DEANNA
This is a car
O DEANNA
This is a gun
O DEANNA
And this a day number one
O DEANNA
Our little crimeworn histories
Black and smoking christmas trees
And honey, it ain't mystery
Why you're a mystery to me

We will eat out of their pantries
And their parlours
Ashy leaving in their beds
And we'll unload into their heads
On this mean season
This little angel that I squeezin'
She ain't been mean to me

O DEANNA
O Deanna!
O DEANNA
You are my friend and my partner
O DEANNA
On this house on the hill
O DEANNA
And I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love or money
I'm down here for your soul

O DEANNA
I am a-knocking
O DEANNA
With my toolbox and my stocking
O DEANNA
And I'll meet you on the corner
O DEANNA
Yes, you point it like a finger
O DEANNA
And squeeze its little thing
O DEANNA
Feel its kick, hear its bang
And let no worry about its issue
Don't worry about where its been
and don't worry about where it hits
Cause it just ain't yours to sin

O DEANNA
No it just ain't your to sin
O DEANNA
Sweet Deanna
O DEANNA
And we ain't getting any younger
O DEANNA
And I don't intend gettin' any older
O DEANNA
The sun a hump at my shoulder
O DEANNA
O Deanna!
O DEANNA
Sweet Deanna
O DEANNA
And I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love of money
I'm down here for your soul
There must be something we can talk about
And maybe there's something here that we can do
No matter what your friends say, don't go too far
Remember there's just one thing
Whenever you come this way
You know I wouldn't get you down
I just like talking to you

It's raining outside
I shake my shoes, downstairs
You never stop dancing
You don't make much sense
No matter what your friends say
Don't go too far
Remember there's just one thing
Whenever you come this way

Maybe we can get together
We can get together
You know I wouldn't get you down
I just like talking to you
Maybe we can get together
We can get together
Later sometime
You can buckle my shoes
You can pick up my sticks
You can knock on my door

There must be something we can talk about
Maybe there's something here we can do
Don't go back home, babe
Don't go too far
Remember there's just one thing
Whenever you come this way

Maybe we can get together
We can get together
You know I wouldn't get you down
I just like talking to you
Maybe we can get together
We can get together
Later sometime
You can buckle my shoes
You can pick up my sticks
You can knock on my door
You know I walk in the rain
I said it rains in my heart
You ought to be in my shoes
Won't you open that door
We can get together
We can get together
Baby, we can get together
We can get together
Later sometime
You can buckle my shoes
You can pick up my sticks
Why don't you open that door

Unlock the door and light the fire
My head is filled with sweet desire
Slip into something comfortable

Now you don't have to fly so low
Don't have to eat or sleep alone
I'm making my way home to you

Don't worry, it's all right
I'll be coming home to see you tonight
Don't worry, it's OK
I'll be coming home today

Just telephoned, I heard you say
This boy of yours is A-OK
No need for tears, I'm on my way

Too many weeks I've had to hide
My face and eyes are up inside
No need to fear, I'm here to stay

Don't worry, it's all right
I'll be coming home to see you tonight
Don't worry, it's OK
I'll be coming home to see you today

I'm coming home to you
(I'm coming home babe)

I'm coming home
(I'm coming home)
I'm coming home
(I'm coming home)
I'm coming home to you tonight

Unlock the door and light the fire
My head is filled with sweet desire
Slip into something comfortable

Now you don't have to fly so low
Don't have to eat or sleep alone
I'm making my way home to you

Don't worry, it's all right
I'll be coming home to see you tonight
Don't worry it's OK
I'll be coming home to see you today

Don't worry it's alright
I'll be coming home to see you tonight
Don't worry it's OK
I'll be coming home to see you today

Don't worry, it's all right
I'll be coming home to see you tonight
Don't worry it's OK
I'll be coming home to see you
Coming home to see ya
I'm coming home babe
Everyday i see you wearing things that have never been worn before
While the children at the government schools send money for the poor
And all you buy you bargain for, with your little man
So that from your silks down to your paramour
Your tres, tres, paragon

So it's a backbeach in the summer
The chalet for the snow
You poor hoochie gucci fiorucci mama
You got really no place to go

Antiques flown in from Venice fill your house upon the hill
While your money sold the soul love of rock and roll
For some cheap disco thrill
I've seen your peers pouting over beers
The loneliness it showed
Mistaking tacky sex for sensuality
They bought in Toorak Road

So it's a backbeach in the summer
The chalet for the snow
You poor hoochie gucci fiorucci mama
You got really no place to go

Inside her empty castle
Her lonely heart will dwell
The life that she's been losing's
Like some stony bagatelle
The loving that you never found
You don't know the reason why

Oh hoochie gucci fiorucci mama
Don't you cry
Drugs, and money
But there's nothin, I'm gonna do about it
You're right, and I'm crazy
But there's nothin, I'm gonna do about it
You're right, and I'm crazy
But there's nothin, I'm gonna do about it

Drugs, and guns
But there's nothin, I'm gonna do about it
You're right, and I'm crazy
But there's nothin, I'm gonna do about it
You're right, and I'm crazy
But there's nothin, I'm gonna do about it

Drugs, and money
But there's nothin, I'm gonna do about it
You're right, and I'm crazy
But there's nothin, I'm gonna do about it

Got your rhymes going round in my head
Got your supersonic beats mixing up my Keds
So dance little DJ come on
What's your name?

I wanna move but I don't feel right
'Cause you've been playing other people's songs all night
So tell me what you're trying to say
What's your name?

Hey, roll over DJ
You're spinning away
All my time
Hey, who cares what you play
Say whatever you say, I don't mind
Hey, roll over DJ, if you don't mind

Well I know that you think you're the star
A pill-poppin' jukebox is all that you are
So tell me it ain't that way
What's you're name?

Hey, roll over DJ
You're spinning away
All my time
Hey, who cares what you play
Say whatever you say, 'cause I don't mind
Hey, roll over DJ if you don't mind

Hey, roll over DJ
You're spinning away
All my time
Hey, who cares what you play
Say whatever you say, 'cause I don't mind
Hey, roll over DJ if you don't mind
Hey, roll over DJ if you don't mind
Hey, roll over DJ if you don't mind
Tonight's the night
I'm gonna make my true confession
I got my courage up
There's nothing that can keep me down now
My words get tangled up in good intentions
But I know what my heart wants to say

I've got to let you know
For worse or for better
There's a hundred ways that I could show you
But it wouldn't matter
It's time to tell you
And I'll try to keep it simple
I know what you want to hear
Why do I forget every time you get near

Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
On the tip of my tongue

Look in my eyes and tell me
What do you see
There's a message that I'm sending
And I hope you receive
My words get tangled up in good intentions
You'll know what my heart wants to say
You'll know what my heart's trying to say

Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Three Little words that I want to say
You'll never know if you walk away

I know what you want to hear
Why do I forget every time you get near

Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Three Little words that I want to say
You'll never know if you walk away

Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
I said-a beau-tiful people
They've got a Robert Palmer t'shirt in their travel bag
Beau-tiful people
They've got a price upon their hea-ea-ead
I said-a beau-tiful people
Have got some friends who just flew in from LA-yay
Beau-tiful people
They haven't really much to say

I said - people, they just want to take you
People, they just want to make you
People, they just want to break you dow-ow-own
They just want to take you down

I said-a beau-tiful people
They ride two hundred dollar pushbikes in the park
Beau-tiful people
They won't admit it but they make love in the dark
Beau-tiful people
Snap frozen potted palms in the corner of the sitting room
Beau-tiful people
The art-decor sonic boom

I said - people, they just want to take you
People, they just want to make you
People, they just want to break you dow-ow-own
Want to take you down, yes they know-ow how
They're gonna get you

I said-a beau-tiful people
You know they're going out tonight to get their Bombay rocks off
Beau-tiful people
They've got a Kerouac conditon, got a cocaine cough
Beau-tiful people
Studio fifty-four is the only place to dance
Beau-tiful people
You know the garden's full of furniture, the house is full of plants

People, they just want to take you
People, they just want to make you
People, they just want to break you dow-ow-own
Want to take you -
People, they just want to make you
People, they just want to take you
People, they just want to break you dow-ow-own
They just want to take you down
I left my heart back in the Orient
Down on Bali bays
It's not the way that I should feel
But it's the way I'm gonna stay

Downhearted
Broken dreams that never really started
Yeah
Downhearted
Broken dreams that never really start

It seems all wrong to be back home
There's no end in sight
Should I be made to drag you through
This lovers and spite

Downhearted
Broken dreams that never really started
Yeah
Downhearted
Broken dreams that never really start

Downhearted
Broken dreams that never really started
Yeah
Downhearted
Broken dreams that never really start

I sometimes think that we should stay
Happy on the farm
I sometimes think I'll give it all away
This love and all it's charms

Downhearted
Broken dreams that never really started
Yeah
Downhearted
Broken dreams that never really started

Yeah
Downhearted
Broken dreams that never really started
Yeah
Downhearted
Broken dreams that never really start
I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm he came around like he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry

Well you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know-or seem to care
what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore

There's nothin' where he used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's goin' on

Nothing's fine
I'm torn
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see 
the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there and not 
some Holy light

But you crawled beneath my veins and 
now I don't care,
I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things

That I can't touch
I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn
Torn

Ohh, ooh...

There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's goin' on

Nothing's right I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late I'm already torn
Torn

Oh,
Oh
Train whistle blowing, makes a sleepy noise,
Underneath their blankets go all the girls and boys.

Rocking, rolling, riding, out along the bay,
All bound for Morningtown, many miles away.

Driver at the engine, fireman rings the bell,
Sand man swings the lantern, to show that all is well.

Maybe it is raining where our train will ride;
All the little travellers are warm and snug inside.

Somewhere there is sunshine, somewhere there is day,

Somewhere there is Morningtown, many miles away.

Back in black, I hit the sack,
I've been too long, 
I'm glad to be back
Yes I'm let loose from the noose,
That's kept me hangin' about
I been livin like a star 'cause it's gettin' me high,
Forget the hearse, 'cause I never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes 
abusing every one of them and running wild

'Cause I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm baaack, baaack...
Well, I'm back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black!

Back in a band,I got Cadillac,
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes I'm in a band with a gang,
they gotta catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track 
and I'm beatin' the flack,
Nobody's gonna get me on another trap
So look at me now, I'm just a makin' my pay,
Don't try to push your luck, 
just get outta my way

'Cause I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back! Yeah, I'm back!
Well, I'm baaack, baaack...
Well, I'm back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black!
Let's go!

Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm baaack, baaack...
Well, I'm back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black-ow!

Aww yeah! Let's go!
Keep on goin'! Yeah yeah!
Yeah... aww yeah yeah!
Here we go!

Well, I'm baaack... (I'm back!)
Baaack... (Well, I'm back!)
Baaack... (I'm back!)
Baaack... (I'm back!)
Baaack... (I'm back!)
Baaack...
Yes, back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black...

Outta sight!
Take a little walk to the edge of town
Go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms,
like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires,
in the humming wires
Hey man, you know
you're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge,
past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat with
a red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms,
tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all those dreams
it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole,
heal your shrinking soul
But there won't be a single thing
that you can do
He's a god, he's a man,
he's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
is a red right hand

You don't own any money?
He'll get you some
You don't have no car?
He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect,
you feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy,
cause here he comes
Through the ghetto and the barrio
and the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares
you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
he ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head,
on the TV screen
And hey buddy, I'll warning
you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god,
he's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
his red right hand
The weightlifter and a library tech you know
Made a big decision in the magazine row
I'll open my catalogue just enough to let you in
And she'll drop beers like you drop vitamins
Did you ever never wanna let somebody down?
Was you ever thinking that you'd be Cathy's clown now she's around

The protein pills and the g-strings you left in her flat
are just enough to get your dewey decimal back
Lift her to work, before your daily workout begins
And she'll stack up like you stack vitamins

Did you ever never wanna let somebody down?
Was you ever thinking that you'd be Cathy's clown now she's around

As I was out walking
Home alone one night
I saw this man approaching
He wore a coat of white

He said, "You don't know me
But you'll very soon find out"
Then the world was darkness
As a cloth clamped around my mouth

I said, where am I?
Where am I?
I don't know
How can I escape?

Slowly I recovered
My head was aching bad
I was laying on the carpet
Inside this madman's lab

Then a voice was speaking
From behind a glass-walled booth
It said: "Welcome stranger
We've got serious work to do"

Where am I?
Where am I?
Someone say more
What's his fiendish plan?

He said "You are my guinea pig
I'm an unsound engineer
I'm going to see how much a man can dig
A thousand voices in his ever-decreasing human ear"

In the echo chamber
I almost went insane
Even my own heartbeat
Caused my eardrum pain

It was like a Phil Spector nightmare
The echo machine ran wild
It was louder, getting louder
I thought that I would die

Where am I?
Where am I?
I never got out of there though I've tried and tried
For twentyfour years
That's why I am where I am now
Where am I?
Where am I?
Where am I?
Where am I?
I'm gonna tear it down before I go
Ah, c'mon, Michaelangelo, you know
Ah-hah-hah (ooh-hooh, ooh-hooh)
Ah-hah, ah-ah-hah-ah (ooh-hooh, ooh-hooh)
Ah-hah

Don't need another weight around my neck
No I don't want no two-timin' nervous wreck
No rich boy to drive my car
Get a message baby, now you stay where you are

You'll hear that wheeler rollin' down the track
Ain't no use in you just turnin' your back
The wind's rockin' the cradle above
This ain't the season or the summer of love

Now if you think you've got it together
There's one thing that you oughta know
You'll never let me go (don't let me go)

Don't need another love to tie me down
Don't want no whispers 'bout you leavin' this town
You might be ready for the show to begin
I ain't got time for any innocent thing, uh-uh, uh-uh

Now if you think you've got it together
Know that there's one thing that you should know
You'll never let me go (don't let me go)
You'll never let me go (don't let me go)
I said you'll never let me go (don't let me go)
No, no, you'll never let me go (don't let me go)
Oh, you make me love you so

Ah-ah-hah-ah (ooh-hooh, ooh-hooh)
Ah-hah, ah-hah-ah (ooh-hooh, ooh-hooh)
Ah-ah-hah-ah

Don't need another weight around my neck
No I don't want no two-timin' nervous wreck
No rich boy, to drive my car
Get a message baby, now you stay where you are

You'll hear that wheeler come rollin' on down the track
No there ain't no use in you just turnin' your back
And it's rockin' the cradle above
This ain't the season or the summer of love

Now if you think you've got it together
Know that there's one thing that you should know
You'll never let me go (don't let me go)
You'll never let me go (don't let me go)
Don't go lookin' through that old camphor box, woman
You know those old things only make you cry
When you dream upon that little bunny rug
Makes you think that life has passed you by

There are days when you wish the world would stop, woman
But then you know some wounds would never heal
But when I browse the early pages of the children
It's then I know exactly how you feel

Hey it's July and the winter sun is shining
And Cootamundra wattle is my friend
For all at once my childhood never left me
'Cause wattle blossoms bring it back again

It's Sunday and you should stop the worrying, woman
Come out here and sit down in the sun
Can't you hear the magpies in the distance
Dont' you know a new day has begun

Can't you hear the bees makin' honey, woman
In the spotted gums where the bellbirds ring
You might grow old and bitter 'cause you missed it
You know some people never hear such things

Hey it's July and the winter sun is shining
And Cootamundra wattle is my friend
For all at once my childhood never left me
'Cause wattle blossoms bring it back again

Don't buy the daily papers any more, woman
Read all about what's going on in hell
They don't care to tell the world of kindness
Good news never made a paper sell

There's all the colours of the rainbow in the garden, woman
And symphonies of music in the sky
Heaven's all around us if you're looking
But how can you see it if you cry

Hey it's July and the winter sun is shining
And Cootamundra wattle is my friend
For all at once my childhood never left me
'Cause wattle blossoms bring it back again
Macainsh

In '68 I bought an axe at the local music shop
I took it home and tuned it up and I began to bop
I played that thing all night and day, each fret from neck to nut
There weren't no riff, I did not know no lick, I could not cut

In '73 I joined a band and wrote some snappy tunes
Went out to play six nights a week to all you drunken hoons
From Leederville to Bondi the news it travelled far
That maybe we could play that 1976 guitar

Wah wah pedal, old Vox amp, Marshall and a Fender
Plug 'em in and tune 'em up, it's the sound we all remember
In '74 we got tight, in '75 we starred
Then we knew we had to play that 1976 guitar

All the way to number one the music did not stop
We were high and mighty but it's lonely at the top
Then one night I met a girl at the Sebel bar
And she taught me how to play that 1976 guitar

Wah wah pedal, old Vox amp, Marshall and a Fender
Plug 'em in and tune 'em up, it's the sound we all remember
We were coming close close but no cigar
Then I found the key to play that 1976 guitar

Ooh, it¹s been a long time since I've opened up that case
Plugged it in and gave the next door neighbours just a taste
Now I know we weaved some magic up upon that stage
Somewhere in the spotlight I think we came of age

But I learnt one simple lesson, no matter who you are
Maybe you can play that 1976 guitar

Wah wah pedal, old Vox amp, Marshall and a Fender
Plug 'em in and tune 'em up, it's the sound we all remember
In '74 we got tight, in '75 we starred
Then we learned to play that 1976 guitar

If you walk the walk, no matter who you are
You can learn to play that 1976 guitar

Could be a Gibson Les Paul ,or Fender Jaguar
Just as long as she's a 1976 guitar
Just as long as she's a 1976 guitar

Na na na na
Na na na na na
Oh yeah

You caught my eye baby, I almost fell off my chair
I lost my composure
You said hello, I felt some major chemistry there

But I don't want to settle for a physical relation
I just got this feeling I could maybe get to heaven with you
If you wanted to

Let's kiss, like the angels do
Let's kiss, like the angels do
Let's kiss like angels do

I can't deny that your smile makes my body respond
But I'm trying to control it
You've got the moves and means for getting just what you want
But baby I can tell there's something sensitive inside you
Come little closer, we can the leave the earth behind if we try
Put you lips on mine

Let's kiss, like the angels do
Let's kiss, like the angels do
Let's kiss like angels do

Na na na na
Let's kiss, oh yeah
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

Take it slow, angels know it's better that way

But I don't want to settle for a physical relation
I just got this feeling I could maybe get to heaven with you
If you wanted to


Na na na na
Like the angels do
Let's kiss, like the angels do

(Repeat to fade)
I will drive down highway one
It's the end that's just begun
And I'm cruising 110
Going nowhere, the road is my best friend
White line fever has got in my blood
I'm a river running full flood

One road all around this land
Like the lifeline in my hand
Out from nowhere the radio sings
Of distant memories that tug on my heartstrings
I feel twisted, feeling uptight
As her face keeps fading from sight


See me spinning out in the Sun
I will burn on highway one
I'm just burning in the Sun
I can't stop until she comes

So wild and I'm dry
It's so dry
And it's so dry
And it feels so dry,

It's so dry
Oh it's-a lonesome away from your kindred and all
By the campfire at night we'll hear the wild dingoes call
But there's-a nothing so lonesome, morbid or drear
Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer

Now the publican's anxious for the quota to come
And there's a far away look on the face of the bum
The maid's gone all cranky and the cook's acting queer
Oh what a terrible place is a pub with no beer

Then the stockman rides up with his dry dusty throat
He breasts up to the bar and pulls a wad from his coat
But the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer
As the barman says sadly the pub's got no beer

Then the swaggie comes in smothered in dust and flies
He throws down his roll and rubs the sweat from his eyes
But when he is told, he says what's this I hear
I've trudged fifty flamin' miles to a pub with no beer

Now there's a dog on the v'randa, for his master he waits
But the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates
He hurries for cover and he cringes in fear
It's no place for a dog 'round a pub with no beer

And old Billy the blacksmith, the first time in his life
Why he's gone home cold sober to his darling wife
He walks in the kitchen, she says you're early Bill dear
But then he breaks down and tells her the pub's got no beer

Oh it's hard to believe that there's customers still
But the money's still tinkling in the old ancient till
The wine buffs are happy and I know they're sincere
When they say they don't care if the pub's got no beer

So it's-a lonesome away from your kindred and all
By the campfire at night we'll hear the wild dingoes call
But there's-a nothing so lonesome, morbid or drear-a
Well you look so cute in your Levis suit
Struttin' down Collins Street
With your Pucci shoes and your faded blues
Honey you look so neat
You dress so well no one could tell
You spend Thursdays with your mechanic
Suburban passion it's all the fashion
Your husband don't need to panic

Mercedes Ladies they got it made
Cos when they dig they use a silver spade

Mercedes Ladies....Mercedes Ladies

You look so smug on your Persian rug
Say your Afghan's got a pedigree
You rest your head on your antique bed
And talk about your arts degree
You act so cool by your heated pool
And take your lunch at three
Own half a boutique that's oh so chic
And work hard for charity

Mercedes Ladies they look so sweet
Cos they get a facelift 'bout twice a week


You knew there's only one thing better than a 250S
And that's a 280SL or a 280SE and there's only one thing better
Than a 350SL and that's a 280CE or a 350SLC or a 300SEL V8

Take pottery classes and you make passes
At every young man you find
Recapture your youth oh ain't it the truth
That you're just one of a kind
You could be left or you could be right
Or you might just vote for kicks
But you're the perfect wife in a perfect life
I won't bore you with politics

Mercedes Ladies they got it made
Cos when they dig they use a silver spade
Mercedes Ladies....Mercedes Ladies
Mercedes Ladies....Mercedes Ladies

Mercedes Ladies they look so sweet
Cos they get a facelift 'bout twice a week
Mercedes Ladies....Mercedes Ladies
Mercedes Ladies....Mercedes Ladies
We've seen her type before
Sandals and the hair
They fall in love with big dumb boys
And we sit and stare

So, we walk the long way home
Glasses in our hands
When the last of the ice is eaten
Throw them as far as we can

There's a problem, there's no sleepy girl
To wrap you in her loving arms
There's a lizard on the doorstep
But there is music in my head

We put the world on hold
Two young men growing old
We talk of years like lost weekends
And the harbor shrugs

Because friends are getting fewer
And we vow life will be fuller
But if the last of our dreams is broken
We'll walk the same way home

There's a problem, there's no sleepy girl
To wrap you in her loving arms
There's no sleepy girl
To wrap you in her loving arms
There's a lizard on the doorstep
And there is music in my head

There's a gold star on your forehead
But there is trouble up ahead
Charlie, what'll become of us?
I had my dreams for both of us, for both of us

You might be unworthy
But you remember what I remember
And that's enough to care
You don't fall off the rails
Give you my word, you can take it
I'm as pure as the driven snow
I'll make a promise, i'll never break it
Yeah, nobody will ever know
I'm supposed to be a saint so I fake it
Yeah my stash is beginning to grow

Just look at me, I'm so easy
Dressed to kill, my teeth are clean
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling sleazy
I'm looking at your peaches and cream
Trust me I'm yours for the taking
I've got the biggest head you've ever seen

Don't you know I'd do anything... to keep my head above water
Don't you know I'd do anything... to keep my head above water

Well have you heard? Would you believe it?
Do you realise how much I know?
I could tell you the biggest story
There's no limit to the seed that I sow
Yeah the suit has a hand so I shake it
My greed is beginning to show

Don't you know I'd do anything... to keep my head above water
Don't you know I'd do anything... to keep my head above water

I'd climb the highest mountain, I'd swim the deepest ocean
I'd girdle the globe just to find the magic potion
That could change everything, that could set me on fire
Bring me down easy on wings of desire
Oh to be alive, I'd suck to survive
I'd do anything; to keep my head above water

Everybody knows, butter wouldn't melt in my mouth
Hey dont you know, I'm as pure as the driven snow
Hey I give you my word, you can take it
I'll make a promise and I'll never break it

He was selling postcards from a paper stand
Whiskey bottle in his withered hand
He put a finger on a photo from an old magazine
And saw himself in the shadow of his dream

They found him with his head inside a tin-pot crown
Told him his feet stank and took him downtown
Called him agitator, spy and thief
Shut him up in solitary third degree

Take a long line
Take a long line
Take a long line
Reel him in

He tried to appeal to the king of might
Said "I'm just exercising my sacred right"
The king he said "You ain't got no rights
You're a madman, a traitor, get outta my sight"

Take a long line
Take a long line
Take a long line
Reel him in

They put him aboard a well wound whirlwind
Pulled out his teeth and told him to grin
He gave them a smile, pulled out a bottle of wine
And said "I never existed, you've been wasting your time"

Take a long line
Take a long line
Take a long line
Reel him in

Started out, just drinkin' beer
I didn't know how or why
Or what I was doin' there
Just a couple more
Made me feel a little better
Believe me when I tell you
It was nothin' to do with the letter

I ran right out of beer
I took a look into the larder
No bones, nothin'
I'd better go and get somethin' harder
Back in a flash
I started on a dash of Jamaica rum
Me and Pat Malone
Drinking on our ow-ow-ow-own

Woh-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger
Woh-yeah, the nips are gettin' bigger
Wo-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger
Yeah-eah-eah, mmm they're gettin' bigger

Sometimes I wonder
What all these chemicals
Are doin' to my brain
Doesn't worry me enough
To stop me from doin' it agai-ai-ain
Wipin' out brain cells
By the millions but I don't care
It doesn't worry me
Even though
I ain't got a lot to spare-are-are

Woh-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger
Woh-yeah-eah, the nips are gettin' bigger
Wo-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger
Yeah-eah-eah, they're gettin' bigger

Escaped from misery
Escaped from war

And now I'm waiting
Now I'm hoping
Now I'm praying
To be accepted

I'm supposed to be free
But I'm locked in a cage

And I'm still waiting
I'm still hoping
I'm still praying
To be accepted

Years of waiting, I have nowhere to go
My whole life depends on their yes or no

Refugees and immigrants also have rights!
They're human beings just like you and me

When you were just a young girl
and still in school
How come you never learned
the golden rule?

Don't talk to strange men,
don't be a fool
I'm hearing stories,
I don't think that's cool
Why dontcha tell me
Someone is a-lovin' you
'Cos you're my girl
Some say it's no longer true
They say you're dating
Some slick Continental dude
I'm tellin' you
Don't talk to strangers
Baby, dontcha talk
Don't talk to strangers
You know he'll only use
Don't talk,
don't talk
Oh, don't talk
Don't talk,
don't talk to him
Nobody, nobody ever told you

Now tell me,
how's life in the big city?
I hear the competition's tough,
baby, that's a pity
Where every man's an actor,
every girl is pretty
I don't like
what's gettin' back to me
Now who's this
Don Juan I've been hearing of
Love hurts
When only one's in love
Now did ya fall at first sight
Or did you need a shove
I'm beggin' you,
please

Romance is gone
He's drifting with the stars
A lyric in his pocket
Little girl in his heart
When you hear his songs
On the radio
I don't need to tell you
What you already know
He's on God's top ten
Where heaven never ends

You saw the world
And the world saw you on the stage
Wild, wild, wild, colonial boy
Roquefort Le Pont
Your gypsy heart is free
Pictures on the wall
Of your family
He's on God's top ten
Where heaven never ends
He's on God's top ten

Baby's got momma's eyes
She was always beautiful
When you hear his voice
Feel his arms around you
You remember mama smiling
A daddy's little girl
Bad weather
Cold media storm
He's on God's top ten
Where heaven never ends
He's on God's top ten
In South Australia I was born
Heave away haul away
In South Australia round Cape Horn
Bound for South Australia

Heave away you rolling kings
Heave away haul away
Heave away oh hear me sing
Bound for South Australia

When I sailed across the sea
Heave away haul away
My girl said she'd be true to me
Bound for South Australia

Heave away you rolling kings
Heave away haul away
Heave away oh hear me sing
Bound for South Australia

When we lolloped round Cape Horn
Heave away haul away
You'd wish to God you'd never been born
Bound for South Australia

Heave away you rolling kings
Heave away haul away
Heave away oh hear me sing
Bound for South Australia

Wish I was on Australia's Strand
Heave away haul away
With a glass of whisky in my hand
Bound for South Australia

Heave away you rolling kings
Heave away haul away
Heave away oh hear me sing
Bound for South Australia

In South Australia I was born
Heave away haul away
In South Australia round Cape Horn
Bound for South Australia

Heave away you rolling kings
Heave away haul away
Heave away oh hear me sing
Bound for South Australia

Heave away you rolling kings
Heave away haul away
Heave away oh hear me sing
Bound for South Australia
The moon came up
The sun went down
Somebody said you were back in town
I kept my mouth shut and waited for the sound
Of your footsteps on the stair
I knew you'd be around
The circumstances were too good to be true
All roads lead to Rome
But mine all led to you
Standing in the backyard sniffing at the sky
How could it be? I had to wonder why...

It's so easy... you made it so easy for me
You made it so easy
You made it so easy for me

I see you in the street, alone with yourself
Crawling my way like a crab on a shelf
I could still read the secrets in the back of your mind
Coming back to haunt the places you left behind

Looking for excuses, searching all around
When you caught sight of me I had to settle down
"Come on", you said, " it should be easier than this"
I never lied, I wanted your kisses

So easy
You make it so easy for me
It should be so easy
It could be so easy for me yeah

You're so easy
You make it so easy for me
It should be so easy
You make it so easy for me yeah

Days ran into weeks
Weeks ran into years
Before I knew it I was mopping up the tears
Another tragedy just left the dance floor
I put my boots on
Went running back for more
Keep me in the picture
Keep me in your book
I'll go out of my mind
If you let me off the hook
I'll sing you the desert, where blackmen sailed
Waterhole to water, where whitemen failed
See the face of dreamers, forgotten souls
Hear the voice of cattlemen crackle in the coals
Maybe we will learn what's written in the sand
A thousand generations living off the land
I'll sing you the waters, runnin' through the town
Wildflowers and Wattles when it settles down
The Outback is impossible, forever and it's free
No way can I find an end to what it means to me

The Outback

I'll sing you the miners, steel and coal
Opals and diamonds, silver and gold
Emeralds and sapphires, I wish for you
Holes in the outback, down below
There's lakes and there's rivers, caves to be found
And there's another landscape underground

I'll sing you the waters runnin' through the town
Wildflowers and Wattles when it settles down
The backbone of the women who fight on and on
The healing of the sunset when all is said and done
The Outback is impossible, forever and it's free
No way can I find an end to what it means to me

To what it means to me
The Outback

I said the joker is a wanted man,
He makes his way all across the land,
See him sifting through the sand,

So I'll tell you all the story,
About the joker and the thief of the night,

Always laughing in the midst of power,
Always living in the final hour,
There is always sweet in the sour,

We are not goin' home,

Can you see the joker flying over,
As she's standing in the field of clover,
Watching out everyday?
I wonder what would happen if he took her away?

What you see well you might not know,
You get the feelin' comin' after the glow,
The vagabond is moving slow,

So I'll tell you all the story,
'bout the joker and the thief of the night,

All the people that he see in the night,
Hold their dreams up to the light,
The old beast is searching for sight,

We are not goin' home,

Can you see the joker flying over,
As she's standing in the field of clover,
Watching out everyday?
I wonder what would happen if he took her away?

Tell you the story 'bout the the joker and the thief,
I said, I'll tell you the story 'bout the the joker and the thief,
I said, I'll tell you the story 'bout the the joker and the thief,
Of the night
They say everything that rises
Will be brought down
Anyone who's anybody
Is getting out of town

The highheels on the long weekend
Clatter in the street below
Somebody got pinned again
Underneath my window

The crowd roars on the wing
And I call out your name
They're keepin' score on the radio
But it all sounds the same (home away game)

The punters on the platform
Stagger throughout the yellow light
Force the door and slash the seats
We're all goin' home tonight

Up and down the nature strip
The Sunday drinkers ride
Faith is flowin' down the Esplanade
Drip try and lemon tide

It's perfect one day
That's when it's raining again
Crouched upon the ocean
Is the city that I live in

Ya never build too high
In January rain

Listen to the ground
There is movement all around
There is something goin' down
And I can feel it

On the waves of the air
There is dancin' out there
If it's something we can share
We can steal it

And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controllin' my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, girl
And the feelin' is right

Then I get that
Night Fever, Night Fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that
Night Fever, Night Fever
We know how to show it

Here I am
Praying for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Born on the wind
Making it mine

In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
Gimme just enough to take us to the mornin'
I got fire in my mind
I get higher in my walkin'
And I'm glowing in the dark
I give you warning

And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controllin' my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, girl
And the feelin' is right

Here I am
Praying for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Born on the wind
Making it mine

Out where the river broke
The bloodwood and the desert oak
Holden wrecks and boiling diesels
Steam in forty five degrees

The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
Let's give it back

How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning

The time has come to say fairs fair
to pay the rent, now to pay our share

Four wheels scare the cockatoos
From Kintore East to Yuendemu
The western desert lives and breathes
In forty five degrees

The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
Let's give it back

How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning

The time has come to say fair's fair
To pay the rent, now to pay our share
The time has come, a fact's a fact
It belongs to them, We're gonna give it back

How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning

In the last days of sun
Her Daddy Long Legs flew
All was left was nearily done
He felt as good as new
But to him was a still a shame
That he soon would disappear
Without a claim to pay
That he believes
And so he drifted on the...
Whe he was sucked into the ventilator of a cinema
And there upon the silver screen
A dancing man appeared
It had white tails
And everybody cheered
Then up into the beam of light he Daddy Long Legs flew
And on the silver screen he shadowed stars and he danced too
Daddy Long Legs , Daddy Long Legs , 2 people with feet
Daddy Long legs , Daddy Long Legs , 2 people with feet
As the man with tail danced each step
Daddy Long Legs danced as well
Until somebody swatted him
And to the ground he fell
He said: what do I care?
I am the only Daddy Long Legs who has danced with friends
Daddy Long Legs, Daddy Long Legs
Daddy Long Legs
Daddy Long Legs ,2 people like feet
Daddy Long Legs,Daddy Long Legs
Daddy Long Legs, 2 people like feet

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Lift your head
C'mon, c'mon
Get up out of bed
Today's the day you hold the world
With your song

Go now, go now, go now
Help escalate
Angels come down
Help with this parade
To hear your voice ring out
C'mon lets shout
And let your song be heard

This is the time
This is the day
That we've been waiting for
All the world will stop
To watch you shine

Hey now, hey now, hey no, hey now
Sing your hymn
This is the ne national anthem
We will all stand on guard
To let you be heard

Let go, let go, let go
All the cannons
How beautiful this world has become
Now everyone will see
What i belive
That these words should be sung

This is the time
This is the day
That we've been waiting for
All the world will stop
To watch you shine
This is the time
This is the day
That we've been waiting
All the world believes
That you will shine

And if you fall
And if you fall
And if you trust and
Yes it will come true

Hey, hey, yeah

This is the time
This is the day
That we've been waiting for
All the world will stop
To watch you shine
This is the time
This is the day
That we've been waiting for
When all the world will stop
To watch you shine
Hey Hey baby I just can't quit
There's a freight train coming I can see my name on it
In the middle of the night in the midnight rain
Banging my heels on the wheels of a runaway train

Banging on midnight bang on the moon
Spend my money making love to you

Tell me darling now what I'll you give
Tell me do you love me like I love the way you live
Down the alligator river on a lonesome train
I'm Rocking my soul in the heart of the hurricane

Banging on midnight bang on the moon
Spend my money making love to you
Banging on a bottle with a medicine spoon
All spend my money making love to you
Put another bullet in my snake skin shoes
Hammer my heart till my heart stops too

I'm calling out your name to the heavens
You can sell my old clothes
When I come rolling through
I've been driving all night long for a life time
And I never meant to get this far away from you

Last chance honey I'm ready to fade
I'm ready to roll
I'm ready for the big parade

Put another bullet in my snake skin shoes
Or hammer my heart till my heart stops too

Banging on a midnight bangin' on the moon
Spend my money making love to you
Banging on a bottle with a medicine spoon
All my money making love to you
Hey Hey baby I just can't quit
There's a freight train coming I can see my name on it
Down the alligator river on a lonesome train
I'm Rocking my soul in the heart of a hurricane
Banging on midnight bangin on the moon
Spend my money making love to you
Banging on a bottle with a medicine spoon
All my money making love to you
I got a two headed dollar and I'm ready to deal
I'm ready to beg don't make me steal
One more midnight one more moon
Spend my money making love to you

Put another bullet in my snake skin shoes

Or hammer my heart till my heart stops too

And I'm calling your name out to the heavens
You can sell my old clothes
When I come rolling through
I've been driving all night long for a life time
And I never meant to get this far away from you

Caged
Hold so tight until your knuckles show
Escape
As far away as you could ever know

You sink them all down
Watch them float up
'Til the wheel has spun around
You will
Be bound by what you are

Stand in the corner, with your face stripped of colour
For what?

If you want to be a passenger
Climb aboard with me, we're leaving now
Step outside and see another world
Only if you want to be a passenger

Chained
So many places you'd prefer to be
Than framed
By a picket fence and salary

You sink them all down
Then watch them float up
Until the
Wheel has spun around

You will be bound by who you are
Tied to the corner
With your
Hope twisted under
In knots

If you want to be a passenger
Climb aboard with me, we're leaving now
Step outside and see another world
Only if you want to be a passenger
Ooooh la la la la la la la
Oooooh la la la la la la la
Oooh la la la la la la la
Oooooh la la la la la la la

Hey, girl - it's a new world, let's have a little fun!
Don't stay hidden away, come and join everyone
Everyone
Outside l'm ready to ride, we can go anywhere
Don't wait, procrastinate take a chance if you dare-
I want to take you there
Find a pace in the sun
You know you want to go - it's no sacrifice
I want what you want, in fact I'll even do it twice
At half the price
Find a place in the sun

Didn't you hear that the war has been won ?
Good people died to provide you a place in the sun
I'm here, what's there to fear ? We're not breaking any law
Someday I know you'll say you wonder
What you waited for
What are you waiting for ?
Find a place in the sun

Didn't you know any wrong you have done
Cannot deny you the right to a place in the sun ?
Find a place in the sun
Now listen

I recall a schoolboy coming home
Through fields of cane
To a house of tin and timber
And in the sky
A rain of falling cinders
From time to time
The waste memory-wastes

I recall a boy in bigger pants
Like everyone
Just waiting for a chance
His father's watch
He left it in the showers
From time to time
The waste memory-wastes

I recall a bigger brighter world
A world of books
And silent times in thought
And then the railroad
The railroad takes him home
Through fields of cattle
Through fields of cane
From time to time
The waste memory-wastes
The waste memory-wastes

I recall the same, a reply
A plan you once had
From time down to mind
That time was bad, so I knew where I was
Alone, and so at home

[Outro: Grant McLennan]
Further, longer, higher, older
All the kings and queens in the Bible
They could not turn back time
So what chance have I of a miracle
In this life of mine?

I only want one day
To unsay the things I said
Undo the thing I did
Twenty four little hours

Oh, God, please wipe them all away
And I promise I will change
If I could start today again

I know I'm not the milk and honey kind
Today I proved it true
When the red mist falls around my eyes
I know not what I do

Please give me back today
And I won't say the things I said
Or do that thing I did
Every minute, every hour

The replay's just the same
And I can't stand the shame
Oh, let me start today again

I only want one day
One lousy day, that's all
Of every day that's been before
Since time began

I know my prayer's in vain
But for a second I'll pretend
That I can start today again

Err, in the lamp light check the scene
In the day my life is a dream
Do you know who you're talking to
Again I'm so glad baby that I'm not like you

Fire in your head, river in your bed
Two hundred dollar, see his face go red
Lost in a world where nothin' is nothin'
Burnt pretty bad, can't get another hit-ah

Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, this oughta be, burnin' up, breakin' down
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, ever want to be, burnin' up, breakin' down

In the lamp light, break the seal
Dream of a place, make it rea-eal
Desire can take you anywhere-ere, hah
But it only lets you down, and there ain't nobody there

Fire in your head, river in your bed
Two hundred dollar, see his face go red
Apollo knows what you do today-ay
Fake it if you like, break it if you can't

Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, this oughta be, burnin' up, breakin' down
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, ever want to be, burnin' up, breakin' down
Na-nah, na-na-nah, na-nah, na-na-nah, yeah

Oh my love, let it take you higher
Everyday meant to take you higher
I only see a memory of what used to be-ee-ee-ee, ooh
Oh-oh, mm-mm-mmm

Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, this oughta be, burnin' up, breakin' down
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, ever want to be, burnin' up, breakin' down
Ah-ah, oh love, mm-mm, yeah, oh-hoh-hoh-hoh

Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, this oughta be, na-nah, na-na-nah
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, ever want to be, na-nah, na-na-nah
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh...
Looking forward, looking back
I’ve come a long way down the track
Got a long way left to go
Making songs, from what I know

Making sense of what I’ve seen
All the love we’ve had between
You and I, along the track
Looking forward, looking back

There are strange days
Full of change on the way
But we’ll be fine, unlike some
I’ll be leaning forward, to see what’s coming

Looking forward, looking back
I’ve come a long way down the track
Got a long way left to go
Making songs, from what I know

If I’m alone at night, I can see
Through all the triviality
Of the day and I’m okay
I just think of those who are dear to me

Looking forward, looking back
I’ve come a long way down the track
Got a long way left to go
Making songs, from what I know
Making songs, from what I know
Looking forward, looking back …

When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
If I know she's worried
Oh I would feel that same old misery
We've been through so much together
We spoke as one and that's what makes it better

Oh and just what just what she means to me now
Oh you just oh you just wouldn't understand
And the people say oh they say she's no good
Oh but she's my woman and don't you know
I'm her man
If she's got a problem oh yeah yeah
Oh I know I'm gonna have to help her solve it

If she's got a problem oh I know
I'm gonna help her
You know I'm gonna have
To help her somehow

Oh sing it again
When something is wrong with my baby
Oh sure now
When something is wrong with my baby oh
Then something is wrong with me
There is freedom within
there is freedom without
Try to catch a deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead
many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car
there's a hole in the roof
my possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
in the paper today
tales of war and of waste
but you turn right over to the T.V. page

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm walking again
to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead
barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

Hey now, Hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, Hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
You know they won't win

Don't let them win
Hey now, Hey now

Hey now, Hey now

Hey now, Hey now
Don't let them win

They come, They come
Don't let them win

Hey now, Hey now (yeah)

Hey now, Hey now
Whoh, I'm broke again
Blew my money on the smell of gin
Whoh, here I go again
Fallin' down on the same old sin

Oh I know, I know, I know I'm wrong
And I know, I know I know I'm gone

If I don't change my ways
I'm livin' by numbered days
It can never last
My life is disappearing fast

But each day I live some more
Missin' my baby so
Pushin' myself to skid row
It's not much further, I know

And if I saw her face
I'd feel so out of place
Wouldn't know what to say
I'd have to look the other way

I'm down on my luck again
Just can't smile and pretend
Really a broken man

Whoh, I'm broke again
I blew my money on the smell of gin
Whoh, here I go again
Fallin' down on the same old sin

Whoh, I'm broke again
Blew my money, now I'm broke again
Whoh, I'm broke again
Blew my money, now I'm broke again
Someday, one day
Time's not so far away
We can share the dreams we've had
Oh, someday, ooh-ooh-ooh!

Hey, there, look in the mirror
Tell me, what do you see before you?
I see someone to be proud of
I see someone that I love

Someday, one day
Time's not so far away
We can share the dreams we've had
Oh, someday, ooh-ooh-ooh!

People say you're a dreamer
What do they know of what you're thinkin'?
If you believe in what you're doin'
Then believe in what I say

Someday, one day
Time's not so far away
We can share the dreams we've had
Oh, someday, ooh-ooh-ooh!

I know you feel discouraged;
Sometimes things move very slowly
And I know that you feel like movin'
Feel like goin', feel like doin'

Someday, one day
Time's not so far away
We can share the dreams we've had
Oh, someday; oh, someday; oh, someday
I'm in the RSL, I joined the Lions club Friday
My support of sport is thought of highly
I'm a Class 6 clerk in the PCD
And who the hell is Ayatollah Khomeni?

It doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter to me
I'll sit home and watch you all on my colour TV

Well I never look further than my own back door
Except when wrapped up in my Commodore
I was reading Nostradamus or 1984
I ran out of Valium and then I got bored

It doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter to me
I'll sit home and watch you all on my colour TV

Well I prune in June and I plant in October
And I write to the council when a sign gets knocked over
I always say the Channel 10 news is best
Especially when the weather girl wears a low cut dress

It doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter to me
I'll sit home and watch you all on my colour TV

Well, my wife ran off to a Women's Shelter
She didn't understand me or why I had to belt her
My daughter carries candles for the festival of light
The fridge is full of beer and I'm all right

It doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter to me
I'll sit home and watch you all on my colour TV

My son's gone off to the Eastern war
And Killen wrote a letter explaining what for
It's the very first job the boy's ever held
He'll learn a good trade while he sees the world

It doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter to me
I'll sit home and watch you all on my colour TV

I'm watching colour TV
Thanking god it's not me
OPEC, Exxon and ITT
Presenting World War Three
Once a girl took my love until I couldn't give anymore
Then I tried to pretend not to see what I couldn't ignore
Oh, my girl don't love me at all
My girl don't love me at all
My girl don't love me at all anymore

I took her to the dance and then I didn't see her all night
Then a friend said he saw her with some other boy just outside
When I went out she was alone
She said, "I would like to go home"
I asked her, "Who were you with?"
She said, "No-one"
I could tell that she lied
And a voice said inside
My girl don't love me at all
My girl don't love me at all
My girl don't love me at all anymore
Not at all

My girl don't love me at all
My girl don't love me at all
My girl don't love me at all anymore
My girl don't love me at all
My girl don't love me at all
My girl don't
My girl don't love me, she don't love me
My girl don't love me

Come to me
My darlin'
Come to me
Then you'll see
How great my love can be
Let me hold you in my arms
Till the storm within you calms
Come to me
My darlin'
Come to me

I have only these wishes
So darlin' would you please
The healing of your kisses
Is my only release

Come to me
My darlin'
Come to me
Let me be
The love I've got to be
I am only just one part
Of your warm and gracious heart

Come to me
My darlin'
Come to me

My words are only water
I hope there never cold
My love like bricks and mortar
I'll build around your soul

I can take good care of all your things
My heart my soul I will always bring
Baby, I will come to the parts
I wouldn't leave you
So don't doubt me
A gone again lover I could never be
Baby, if I died making love to you
You know I'll come back to haunt you

I just don't wanna be lonely
Cause the lights, were shining ever so bright
In my hand there's a pulse of my beating heart
Biting my tongue there's a plastic man on the telephone

Can you see the bright light? Shining, I dont know
Can you see the bright light? Shining, shining, shining

I saw a UFO and nobody believes me
I was sixteen miles from home with nobody in sight
I saw a UFO but nobody believes me
And Whats it gonna take to get me back home tonight

Can you see the bright light? Shining, I dont know
Is it a reflection of anyone? The big glow
And tell me this is all good, and you say, I dont know
Im very very far from home

I saw a UFO and nobody believes me
I was sixteen miles from home with nobody in sight
I saw a UFO but nobody believes me
And Whats it gonna take to get me back home tonight

(hello? hello? hello? hello?)

I saw a UFO and nobody believes me
I was sixteen miles from home with nobody in sight
I saw a UFO and nobody believes me
And whats it gonna take to get me back home tonight

And whats it gonna take to
And whats it gonna take to
And whats it gonna, whats it gonna whats it gonna take to
And whats it gonna take to
And whats it gonna take to
And whats it gonna take to
And whats it gonna take to, get me back home tonight
(tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
Six years I've lived in the city
And every night I dream of the sea
They say home is where you find it
Will this place ever satisfy me

For I come from the salt water people
We always lived by the sea
Now I'm down here living in the city
With my man and the family

My island home
My island home
My island home
Is waiting for me
(MUSIC)

In the evening the dry wind blows
From the hills and across the plains
I close my eyes and I'm standing
In a boat on the sea again
And i'm holding that longturtle spear
And i feel i'm close now to where it must be
My island home is
Waiting for me
(MUSIC)

For i come from the salt water people
We always lived by the sea
Now i'm down here living in the city
With my man and a family

My island home
My island home
My island home
Is waiting for me

My island home (Fade away)
Well we don't need no one to tell us what to do
Oh yes we're on our own and there's nothing you can do
So we don't need no one like you
To tell us what to do

We don't refer to the past when we're showing what we've done
Our generation gap means the war is never won
The past is in your head
The future's in our hands

'Cause I'm a brat
And I know everything
And I talk back
'Cause I'm not listening
To anything you say

And if you count to three (one two three)
You'll see there's no emergency
You'll see I'm not the enemy
Just a prisoner of society

Well we don't need no one to tell us what to do
Oh yes we're on our own and there's nothing you can do
So we don't need no one like you

And I talk back
'Cause I'm not listening
To anything you say

And if you count to three (one two three)

Just a prisoner of society society society society
Society society society society

I know I can be a little stubborn sometimes 
A little righteous and too proud 
I just want to find a way to compromise 
Cos I believe that we can work things out

I thought I had all the answers never giving in 
But baby since you've gone I admit that I was wrong

All I know is I'm lost without you I'm not gonna lie 
How my going to be strong without you I need you by my side 
If we ever say we'll never be together and we ended with goodbye don't know what I'd do ...I'm lost without you 
I keep trying to find my way but all I know is I'm lost without you 
I keep trying to face the day I'm lost without you

How my ever gonna get rid of these blues 
Baby I'm so lonely all the time 
Everywhere I go I get so confused 
You're the only thing that's on my mind

Oh my beds so cold at night and I miss you more each day 
Only you can make it right no I'm not too proud to say

All I know is I'm lost without you I'm not gonna lie 
How my going to be strong without you I need you by my side 
If we ever say we'll never be together and we ended with goodbye don't know what I'd do ...I'm lost without you 
I keep trying to find my way but all I know is I'm lost without you 
I keep trying to face the day I'm lost without you

If I could only hold you now and make the pain just go away 
Can't stop the tears from running down my face 
Oh

All I know is I'm lost without you I'm not gonna lie 
How my going to be strong without you I need you by my side 
If we ever say we'll never be together and we ended with goodbye don't know what I'd do ...I'm lost without you 
I keep trying to find my way but all I know is I'm lost without you 
I keep trying to face the day I'm lost without you
